40|$|Background The {{need for}} formal and {{structured}} approaches for <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of medicines is increasing, {{as is the}} complexity of the scientiﬁc questions addressed before making decisions on the beneﬁt–risk balance of medicines. We systematically collected, appraised and classiﬁed available beneﬁt–risk methodologies to facilitate and inform their future use. Methods A systematic review of publications identiﬁed <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>assessment</b> methodologies. Methodologies were appraised on their fundamental principles, features, graphical representations, assessability and accessibility. We created a taxonomy of methodologies to facilitate understanding and choice. Results We identiﬁed 49 methodologies, critically appraised and classiﬁed them into four categories: frameworks, metrics, estimation techniques and utility survey techniques. Eight frameworks describe qualitative steps in <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and eight quantify beneﬁt–risk balance. Nine metric indices include threshold indices to measure either beneﬁt or risk; health indices measure quality-of-life over time; and trade-off indices integrate beneﬁts and risks. Six estimation techniques support beneﬁt–risk modelling and evidence synthesis. Four utility survey techniques elicit robust value preferences from relevant stakeholders to the beneﬁt–risk decisions. Conclusions Methodologies to help beneﬁt– risk assessments of medicines are diverse and each is associated with different limitations and strengths. There is not a ‘one-size-ﬁts-all’ method, and a combination of methods may be needed for each <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> The taxonomy introduced herein may guide choice of adequate methodologies. Finally, we recommend 13 of 49 methodologies for further appraisal for use in the real-life <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of medicine...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to draw on the {{practical}} experience from the PROTECT BR case studies and make recommendations regarding the application of a number of methodologies and visual representations for <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> Methods Eight case studies based on the benefit–risk balance of real medicines were used to test various methodologies that had been identified from the literature as having potential applications in <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> Recommendations were drawn up based on the results of the case studies. Results A general pathway through the case studies was evident, with various classes of methodologies having roles to play at different stages. Descriptive and quantitative frameworks were widely used throughout to structure problems, with other methods such as metrics, estimation techniques and elicitation techniques providing ways to incorporate technical or numerical data from various sources. Similarly, tree diagrams and effects tables were universally adopted, with other visualisations available to suit specific methodologies or tasks as required. Every assessment was found to follow five broad stages: (i) Planning, (ii) Evidence gathering and data preparation, (iii) Analysis, (iv) Exploration and (v) Conclusion and dissemination. Conclusions Adopting formal, structured approaches to <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>assessment</b> was feasible in real-world problems and facilitated clear, transparent decision-making. Prior to this work, no extensive practical application and appraisal of methodologies had been conducted using real-world case examples, leaving users with limited knowledge of their usefulness in the real world.

40|$|Pazopanib, an orally {{administered}} antineoplastic agent targeting multiple {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitors (TKIs), {{is one of}} currently 6 approved targeted agents {{for the treatment of}} locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Based on the safety and efficacy results of a pivotal phase III trial the EMA granted conditional approval for pazopanib for the treatment of RCC. The primary endpoint – progression free survival (PFS) – analysis demonstrated superiority of pazopanib compared to placebo (HR 0. 46; 95 % CI, 0. 34 to 0. 62; p< 0. 0001) in the overall study population. This superiority effect was more pronounced within the treatment-naïve subgroup compared to the cytokine pre-treated subgroup. Response rate in the overall study population was 30 % and 3 % for the intervention and control group, respectively.

40|$|BackgroundAn {{urgent need}} {{exists in the}} United States to {{establish}} treatment goals in psoriasis. ObjectiveWe aim to establish defined treatment targets toward which clinicians and patients with psoriasis can strive to inform treatment decisions, reduce disease burden, and improve outcomes in practice. MethodsThe National Psoriasis Foundation conducted a consensus-building study among psoriasis experts using the Delphi method. The process consisted of: (1) literature review, (2) pre-Delphi question selection and input from general dermatologists and patients, and (3) 4 Delphi rounds. ResultsA total of 25 psoriasis experts participated in the Delphi process. The most preferred instrument was body surface area (BSA). The most preferred time for evaluating patient response after starting new therapies was at 3  months. The acceptable response at 3  months postinitiation was either BSA 3 % or less or BSA improvement 75 % or more from baseline. The target response at 3  months postinitiation was BSA 1 % or less. During the maintenance period, evaluation every 6  months was most preferred. The target response at every 6  months maintenance evaluation is BSA 1 % or less. LimitationsAlthough BSA is feasible in practice, it does not encompass health-related quality of life, costs, and risks of side effects.

40|$|Joint {{evaluation}} of drugs’ beneficial and adverse effects {{is required in}} many situations, in particular to inform decisions on initial or sustained marketing of drugs, or to guide the treatment of individual patients. This synthesis, known as <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment,</b> is without doubt important: timely decisions supported by transparent and sound assessments can reduce mortality and morbidity in potentially large groups of patients. At the same time, it can be hugely complex: drug effects are generally disparate in nature and likelihood, and the information {{that needs to be}} processed is diverse, uncertain, deficient, or even unavailable. Hence there is a clear need for methods that can reliably and efficiently support the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> process. For already marketed drugs, this process often starts with the detection of previously unknown risks that are subsequently integrated with all other relevant information for joint analysis. In this thesis, quantitative methods are devised to support different aspects of drug <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment,</b> and the practical usefulness of these methods is demonstrated in clinically relevant case studies. Shrinkage regression is adapted and implemented for large-scale screening in collections of individual case reports, leading to the discovery of a link between methylprednisolone and hepatotoxicity. This adverse effect is then considered as part of a complete <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of methylpredniso­lone in multiple sclerosis relapses, set in a general framework of probabilistic decision analysis. Two methods devised in the thesis substantively contribute to this assessment: one for efficient generation of utility distributions for the considered clinical outcomes, driven by modelling of qualitative information; and one for computing risk limits for rare and otherwise non-quantifiable adverse effects, based on collections of individual case reports. At the time of the doctoral defence the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 6 : Manuscript; Paper 7 : Manuscript. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> {{should be}} ongoing {{during the life}} cycle of a {{pharmaceutical}} agent. New products are subjected to rigorous registration laws and rules, which attempt to assure the availability and validity of evidence. For older products, bias in <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> is more likely, as a number of safeguards were not in place at the time these products were registered. This issue of bias in <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of older products is illustrated here with an example: buflomedil in intermittent claudication. Data on efficacy were retrieved from a Cochrane systematic review. Data on safety were obtained by comparing the number of reports of serious adverse events and fatalities published in the literature with those reported in postmarketing surveillance databases. In the case of efficacy, the slim basis of evidence for the benefit of buflomedil is undermined by documented publication bias. In the case of safety, bias in reporting to international safety databases is illustrated by the discrepancy between the number of drug-related deaths published in the literature (20), the potentially drug-related deaths in the WHO database (20) and deaths attributed to buflomedil in the database of the international marketing authorization holder (11). In older products, efficacy cannot be evaluated without a thorough search for publication bias. For safety, case reporting of drug-related serious events and deaths in the literature remains a necessary instrument for risk appraisal of older medicines, despite the existence of postmarketing safety databases. The enforcement of efficient communication between healthcare workers, drug companies, national centres of pharmacovigilance, national poison centers and the WHO is necessary to ensure the validity of postmarketing surveillance reporting systems.

40|$|The {{prevention}} and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a clinical challenge, primarily owing to drawbacks {{associated with the use}} of heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). These and other factors, including a growing elderly population, mean that VTE presents a continuing burden to patients and physicians. Anticoag - ulant therapy is a fundamental approach for VTE management. Non- VKA oral anticoagulants, including the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, and the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, have been studied in phase III trials across a spectrum of thromboembolic disorders. These agents offer simplified care, with similar or improved efficacy and safety outcomes compared with heparins and vitamin K antagonists. There are several factors a physician must consider when prescribing an anticoagulant. An important consideration with all anticoagulant use is bleeding risk, especially in high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with renal impairment or cancer. In orthopaedic patients, other risks include a need for surgical revision or blood transfusion, or wound complications. Therefore, the clinical benefits of an anticoagulant should ideally be balanced with any risks associated with the therapy. Quantitative <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>assessments</b> are lacking, and owing to differences in trial design the non-VKA oral anticoagulants cannot be compared directly. Based on trial and “reallife” data, this review will summarise the clinical data for the non-VKA oral anticoagulants in the {{prevention and}} treatment of VTE, focusing on the balance between the benefits and risks of anticoagulation with these drugs, and their potential impact on VTE management...|$|R
40|$|The European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) is {{a project}} led by the European Medicines Agency aimed at further {{strengthening}} the post-authorisation monitoring of medicinal products in Europe by facilitating the conduct of multi-centre, independent post-authorisation studies focusing on safety and benefit/risk assessment. ENCePP has recently established a WG on HTA to develop methodological guidance to supplement the efficacy and safety aspects of medicines known {{at the time of}} marketing authorisation (MA) and to bridge the needs of HTA and post-marketing <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> Decision makers are often faced with the challenge that long-term, real-world data on safety and effectiveness is lacking at the time of MA. This creates uncertainty around the medicines' risk-benefit profile while manufacturers, health care providers, and patient groups exert pres sure by demanding early decisions and rapid access. Decision makers may unduly delay potential benefits to patients by waiting for stronger evidence, or may endorse medicines that later turn out to have a less robust benefit-risk ratio, to be ineffective cost-ineffective, or even harmful. Hence, many countries have developed mechanisms that allow temporary access to promising medicines while concurrently requesting the generation of additional evidence to reduce uncertainty. Their objective is an optimal trade-off between different stakeholder needs, flexibility, responsiveness, and rigor as well as the flexibility to revise decisions on access when new evidence becomes available. The ENCePP WG on HTA has the potential to become a capacity building tool for regulatory and HTA agencies to develop research structures aimed at complementing the evidence generation for MA and market access. Post-authorisation studies developed under the auspices of ENCePP could provide new safety and clinical effectiveness information of marketed medicines. ENCePP expertise, research experience and health care databases may also contribute to the coordination, methodological guidance and data sourcing for the enhancement of HTA processes...|$|R

This study assessed the treatment preferences of patients with type 2 diabetes by educational attainment. Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from a national online panel in the US. Treatment preferences were assessed using a discrete-choice experiment. Participants completed 16 choice tasks in which they compared pairs of treatment profiles composed of six attributes: A 1 c decrease, stable blood glucose, low blood glucose, nausea, treatment burden, and out-of-pocket cost. Choice models and willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates were estimated using a conditional logit model and were stratified by educational status. Results: A total of 231 participants {{with a high school}} diploma or less education, 156 participants with some college education, and 165 participants with a college degree or more completed the survey. Participants with a college degree or more education were willing to pay more for A 1 c decreases ($ 58. 84, standard error [SE]: 10. 6) than participants who had completed some college ($ 28. 47, SE: 5. 53) or high school or less ($ 17. 56, SE: 3. 55) (p≤ 0. 01). People with a college education were willing to pay more than people with high school or less to avoid nausea, low blood glucose events during the day/night, or two pills per day. Conclusion: WTP for aspects of diabetes medication differed for people with a college education or more and a high school education or less.

40|$|Background: The {{gap between}} pre-clinical {{pharmaceutical}} research and clinical/epidemiological research hampers optimal <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and monitoring {{of new and}} existing medicines. Many excellent health care databases {{are available in the}} Netherlands for pharmaco-epidemiologic and -economic research.

Objectives: To optimize routine health care databases in the Netherlands for pharmaco-epidemiologic and economic research in order to improve <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and monitoring of new and existing medicines. Methods: We build an ICT infrastructure for linkage of healthcare/research databases in the Netherlands. To protect privacy, pseudonimisation and linkage was performed by a trusted third party (TTP). A data catalogue was developed to allow queries over the integrated databases which will help in designing pharmacoepidemiologic studies (incl. sample size calculations, assessment of completeness of data). Results: We linked pharmacy records from the National Foundation of Pharmaceutical Statistics (n> 12, 000, 000) on a patient base to several routine health care databases such as the Almere Health Care database (n= 160, 000), the Utrecht Health Project (n= 20, 000), and the AGIS claims database (n= 1, 200, 000).

When prescribing anticoagulant prophylaxis, clinicians weigh the benefits of thromboprophylaxis against bleeding risk and other adverse events. Previous benefit–risk analyses of the REgulation of Coagulation in ORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (RECORD) randomized clinical studies of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin after total hip (THA) or knee (TKA) arthroplasty generally used pooled THA and TKA results, counted fatal bleeding as both an efficacy and a safety event, and included the active and placebo-controlled portions of RECORD 2, which might confound <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> We conducted a post hoc analysis without these constraints to assess benefit–risk for rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin in the RECORD studies. Patients and methods: Data from the safety population of the two THA and two TKA studies were pooled separately. The primary analysis compared the temporal course of event rates and rate differences between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin prophylaxis for symptomatic venous thromboembolism plus all-cause mortality (efficacy events) versus nonfatal major bleeding (safety events). Additionally, these rates were used to derive measures of net clinical benefit, number needed to treat (NNT), and number needed to harm (NNH) for these two end points. Results: After THA or TKA, and compared with enoxaparin, rivaroxaban therapy resulted in more efficacy events prevented than safety events caused, with benefits exceeding harms early and throughout treatment and follow-up. Relative to enoxaparin, rivaroxaban treatment prevented six efficacy events per harm event caused for THA, with NNT = 262 /NNH = 1, 711. For TKA, rivaroxaban treatment prevented four to five efficacy events per harm event caused, with NNT = 102 /NNH = 442. Sensitivity analysis that included surgical-site bleeding resulted in NNH = 345 for THA and NNH = 208 for TKA. Conclusion: In the RECORD studies, considering death, symptomatic venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding, rivaroxaban resulted in greater benefits than harms compared with enoxaparin. When incorporating surgical-site bleeding, rivaroxaban also results in greater benefit than harm for TKA and is balanced with enoxaparin for THA.

40|$|Purpose One of {{the most}} {{important}} uses of <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> pertains to approval of new medicines by regulatory authorities and the subsequent review of these products during their life-cycle when new safety and/or efficacy data becomes available. At present, there exist no validated, well-accepted models for <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> that have the appropriate degree of sophistication, and as a consequence no models are widely used by regulatory authorities or industry. The aim of the study was therefore to develop a new model for <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of medicines using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Methods The MCDA methodology was used for a systematic approach to assess the benefit risk ratio of medicines. The reasons for adopting this approach were (1) taking multiple benefit and risk criteria into account, (2) making a judgement on the evidence and potential uncertainty because of the incompleteness of evidence, and (3) making trade-offs of the benefits against risks. Results It was demonstrated through a seven-step approach how MCDA is used to construct the model. Ten benefit and ten risk criteria were identified to form a value tree. Then fixed scales were established for all criteria and options on the criteria were scored. Weights were assigned for each criteria using swing-weighting. Finally sensitivity analysis was carried. Conclusions This novel approach based on MCDA has the potential for being applied as a new tool for judging and deciding on the benefits and risks, thereby helping regulators and industry in the development and approval of new medicines and their adequate use.

40|$|Purpose Optimizing a {{therapeutic}} product's benefit-risk profile is an on-going process throughout the product's life cycle. Different, yet related, <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> strategies and frameworks {{are being developed}} by various regulatory agencies, industry groups, and stakeholders. This paper summarizes current best practices and discusses {{the role of the}} pharmacoepidemiologist in these activities, taking a life-cycle approach to integrated <b>Benefit-Risk</b> <b>Assessment,</b> Communication, and Evaluation (BRACE). Methods A review of the medical and regulatory literature was performed for the following steps involved in therapeutic benefit-risk optimization: benefit-risk evidence generation; data integration and analysis; decision making; regulatory and policy decision making; benefit-risk communication and risk minimization; and evaluation. Feedback from International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology members was solicited {{on the role of the}} pharmacoepidemiologist. The case example of natalizumab is provided to illustrate the cyclic nature of the benefit-risk optimization process. Results No single, globally adopted <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> process exists. The BRACE heuristic offers a way to clarify research needs and to promote best practices in a cyclic and integrated manner and highlight the critical importance of cross-disciplinary input. Its approach focuses on the integration of BRACE activities for risk minimization and optimization of the benefit-risk profile. Conclusion The activities defined in the BRACE heuristic contribute to the optimization of the benefit-risk profile of therapeutic products in the clinical world at both the patient and population health level. With interdisciplinary collaboration, pharmacoepidemiologists are well suited for bringing in methodology expertise, relevant research, and public health perspectives into the BRACE process.

40|$|PURPOSE: Difficulties may be {{encountered}} when undertaking a <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for {{an older}} product with well-established use but with a benefit-risk balance that may have changed over time. This case study investigates this specific situation by applying a formal benefit-risk framework to assess the benefit-risk balance of warfarin for primary prevention of patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We used the qualitative framework BRAT {{as the starting point}} of the benefit-risk analysis, bringing together the relevant available evidence. We explored the use of a quantitative method (stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis) to demonstrate how uncertainties and preferences on multiple criteria can be integrated into a single measure to reduce cognitive burden and increase transparency in decision making. RESULTS: Our benefit-risk model found that warfarin is favourable compared with placebo for the primary prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. This favourable benefit-risk balance is fairly robust to differences in preferences. The probability of a favourable benefit-risk for warfarin against placebo is high (0. 99) in our model despite the high uncertainty of randomised clinical trial data. In this case study, we identified major challenges related to the identification of relevant benefit-risk criteria and taking into account the diversity and quality of evidence available to inform the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> CONCLUSION: The main challenges in applying formal methods for medical <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for a marketed drug are related to outcome definitions and data availability. Data exist from many different sources (both randomised clinical trials and observational studies), and the variability in the studies is large. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Veterinary {{medicinal}} products (VMPs) require, {{as part of}} the European Union (EU) authorization process, consideration of both risks and benefits. Uses of VMPs have multiple risks (e. g., risks to the animal being treated, to the person administering the VMP) including risks to the environment. Environmental risks are not directly comparable to therapeutic benefits; there is no standardized approach to compare both environmental risks and therapeutic benefits. We have developed three methods for communicating and comparing therapeutic benefits and environmental risks for the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> that supports the EU authorization process. Two of these methods support independent product evaluation (i. e., a summative classification and a visual scoring matrix classification); the other supports a comparative evaluation between alternative products (i. e., a comparative classification). The methods and the challenges to implementing a <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> including environmental risk are presented herein; how these concepts would work in current policy is discussed. Adaptability to scientific and policy development is considered. This work is an initial step {{in the development of a}} standardized methodology for integrated decision-making for VMPs...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{regulators}} make marketing authorisation {{decisions based}} on the benefit-risk balance of a treatment with little input from patients and the public. The aims of this thesis are to apply systematic methods of <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> proposed for use in regulatory decision-making, and examine how they can incorporate patient and public involvement. These aims were met through the investigation of three case studies: efalizumab, rimonabant, and natalizumab. Efalizumab (indication: plaque psoriasis) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. I examined the feasibility of applying descriptive and quantitative frameworks to determine the benefit-risk balance of efalizumab, and evaluated where patient and public involvement can be applied in the decision-making process. Rimonabant (indication: overweight and obesity) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders. I conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit patient and public preferences regarding the benefits and risks of treatment, and developed a probabilistic analysis method to analyse the preference data and determine the benefit-risk balance of rimonabant. Natalizumab (indication: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) received authorisation, but the benefit-risk balance was reassessed due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Authorisation was maintained with risk minimisation measures. I developed a framework to guide the application, reporting, and evaluation of patient and public involvement in <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> I then tested the feasibility of the framework with protocols designed to elicit patient and public preferences on the benefits and risks of natalizumab. Based {{on the findings of}} these case studies, preferences can be elicited from patients and the public and used to determine the benefit-risk balance of a medicine. This thesis provides a methodological foundation to guide the application, reporting and evaluation of PPI in the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of medicines and improve the legitimacy, transparency, and quality of regulatory decision-making.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{importance}} of a framework for a systematic structured assessment of the benefits and risks has been established, but in addition, {{it is necessary that}} the benefit-risk decisions and the processes to derive those decisions are documented and communicated to various stakeholders for accountability. Hence there is now a need to find appropriate tools to enhance communication in a manner that would uphold transparency, consistency and standards. MethodsA retrospective, non-comparative study was conducted to determine the applicability and practicality of a summary template in documenting <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and communicating benefit-risk balance and conclusions for reviewers to other stakeholders. The benefit-risk (BR) Summary Template and its User Manual was evaluated by 12 reviewers within a regulatory agency in Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). ResultsThe BR Summary Template was found to be adequate in documenting benefits, risks, relevant summaries and conclusions, while the User Manual was useful in guiding the reviewer in completing the template. The BR Summary Template was also considered a useful tool for communicating benefit-risk decisions to a variety of stakeholders. ConclusionsThe use of a template may be of value for the communicating <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of medicines to stakeholders...|$|E

Long-term safety of psoriasis therapies has been questioned, with the spectrum {{of systemic}} immunosuppression potentially leading to increased cancer risk. In this issue, Brauchli et al. report on a population-based analysis of cancer risk in a large cohort of psoriasis patients, most of whom had not been treated with systemic agents. The study prepares the ground for future prospective long-term cohort studies in psoriasis patients treated with systemic therapies, including biological agents...|$|E
40|$|The <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> {{of drugs}} {{has become a}} complex and dynamic process. The model has moved from a one-off {{marketing}} authorization to an ongoing life-cycle approach where decisions {{has to be made}} based on the information available at every given time point. Especially interesting is the case of antidiabetics, characterized in the recent years for the increasing number of drugs approved together with the emergence of safety concerns that have brought controversial cases to the medical, pharmaceutical and regulatory world. The aim of this thesis is to consider the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> process of different novel oral antidiabetics and safety-related regulatory actions, identifying the factors and challenges surrounding this process and possible ways to address the problems identified. A literature research was performed using the databases MEDLINE and the Cochrane library for all scientific publications until July 2014, prioritizing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Safety-regulatory actions were retrieved from FDA’s MedWatch, European Medicines Agency and the Medicines Evaluation Board. The controversial cases of the thiazolidinediones as well as the more recently approved GLP- 1 analogues and DPP- 4 inhibitors are presented. Together with the descriptive analysis, a graphical display of the use of the different drugs during the last years in the Netherlands and the safety-related regulatory actions taken by the authorities given the available evidence at that moment is shown...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that "real" research issues are socially relevant, provide findings with utility beyond the profession, and are anticipatory. An industrializing agricultural sector, an evolving {{political economy of}} agroenvironmental policy, an increasingly transnational economy, and rapid population growth are important sources of change to which research on real agroenvironmental issues must respond. Specific, identified "real" research issue areas include: <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> methodology; agroenvironmental regulation for industrialized agriculture; trade agreements and environmental quality; the recreation-tourism-agriculture interface; sustainable development; {{and the formation of}} preferences.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe Problem formulation, Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, Trade-offs, Uncertainties, Risk attitude, and Linked {{decisions}} (PrOACT-URL) {{framework and}} multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) have been {{recommended by the}} European Medicines Agency for structured <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of medicinal products undergoing regulatory review. ObjectiveThe objective {{of this article was}} to provide solutions to incorporate the uncertainty from clinical data into the MCDA model when evaluating the overall benefit-risk profiles among different treatment options. MethodsTwo statistical approaches, the δ-method approach and the Monte-Carlo approach, were proposed to construct the confidence interval of the overall benefit-risk score from the MCDA model as well as other probabilistic measures for comparing the benefit-risk profiles between treatment options. Both approaches can incorporate the correlation structure between clinical parameters (criteria) in the MCDA model and are straightforward to implement. ResultsThe two proposed approaches were applied to a case study to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of an add-on therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (drug X) relative to placebo. It demonstrated a straightforward way to quantify the impact of the uncertainty from clinical data to the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and enabled statistical inference on evaluating the overall benefit-risk profiles among different treatment options. ConclusionsThe δ-method approach provides a closed form to quantify the variability of the overall benefit-risk score in the MCDA model, whereas the Monte-Carlo approach is more computationally intensive but can yield its true sampling distribution for statistical inference. The obtained confidence intervals and other probabilistic measures from the two approaches enhance the benefit-risk decision making of medicinal products...|$|E
40|$|The {{intake of}} probiotics has been {{associated}} with beneficial effects on the immune system, such as improved disease resistance and diminished risk of allergies. This review gives an overview of the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics investigated with in vitro assays, experimental animal models, and clinical trials, and explores possible mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory effects. Immunomodulation, however, is not always beneficial and might induce detrimental effects; therefore, a scheme is proposed for <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>assessment</b> of immunomodulation by probiotics. Within this scheme, expert judgment based on data derived from a panel of in vitro assays, animal models, and clinical trials should lead to conclusions on efficacy and safety aspects of probiotics...|$|E
