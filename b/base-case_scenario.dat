40|$|Background: The societal, {{clinical}} and economic burden {{imposed by the}} complications of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection - including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - {{is expected to increase}} over the coming decades. However, new therapies may improve sustained virological response (SVR) rates and shorten treatment duration. This study aimed to estimate the future burden of HCV-related disease in England if current management strategies remain the same and the impact of increasing diagnosis and treatment of HCV as new therapies become available. Methods: A previously published model was adapted for England using published literature and government reports, and validated through an iterative process of three meetings of HCV experts. The impact of increasing diagnosis and treatment of HCV as new therapies become available was modelled and compared to the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario</b> of continuing current management strategies. To assess the ‘best case’ clinical benefit of new therapies, the number of patients treated was increased by a total of 115 % by 2018. Results: In the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> total viraemic (HCV RNA-positive) cases of HCV in England will decrease from 144, 000 in 2013 to 76, 300 in 2030. However, due to the slow progression of chronic HCV, the number of individuals with cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC will continue to increase over this period. The model suggests that the ‘best case’ substantially reduces HCV-related hepatic disease and HCV-related liver mortality by 2020 compared to the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario.</b> The number of HCV-related HCC cases would decrease 50 % by 2020 and the number progressing from infection to decompensated cirrhosis would decline by 65 %. Therefore, compared to projections of current practices, increasing treatment numbers by 115 % by 2018 would reduce HCV-related mortality by 50 % by 2020. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that with current treatment practices the number of patients developing HCV-related cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC will increase substantially, with HCV-related liver deaths likely to double by 2030. However, increasing diagnosis and treatment rates could optimise the reduction in the burden of disease produced by the new therapies, potentially halving HCV-related liver mortality and HCV-related HCC by 2020. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Traditional 'delta-change' {{approach}} of scenario generation for climate change impact assessment to water resources strongly {{depends on the}} selected base-case observed historical climate conditions that the climate shocks are to be super-imposed. This method disregards the combined effect of climate change and the inherent hydro-climatological variability in the system. Here we demonstrated a hybrid uncertainty approach in which uncertainties in historical climate variability are combined with uncertainties in climate predictions to conduct more comprehensive climate change impact assessment to hydropower in Zambezi and Congo River basins.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDiffuse large B-cell {{lymphoma}} (DLBCL) has primarily {{been treated}} with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and predisone (CHOP) chemotherapy since the 1970 s. Recently, the addition of rituximab to CHOP (CHOP-R) {{has been found to}} improve survival and trial-based results have suggested that it is a cost-effective alternative to CHOP. ObjectivesThe objective in this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CHOP-R relative to CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL in a population-based setting in British Columbia, Canada. MethodsWe created a patient-level simulation model describing potential pathways for DLBCL patients initiating treatment with either CHOP or CHOP-R. Model parameters were populated with statistical analyses of individual-level treatment and effectiveness data and published cost estimates. All results were stratified by age at treatment initiation (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years). The <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario</b> was based on a 15 -year time horizon and a 3 % discount rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. All costs are reported as 2006 $CDN. ResultsFor the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for younger individuals ranged from $ 11, 965 per disease-free life-year gained to $ 19, 144 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For older individuals, estimated ICERs for all health outcomes were below $ 10, 000 per unit outcome gained for a 15 -year time horizon. ConclusionsUsing population-based data, CHOP-R was found to be a cost-effective alternative to CHOP, particularly for individuals aged 60 years and older. Results from this Canadian observational data source were consistent with international clinical trial-based studies. The use of CHOP-R as a first-line treatment for DLBCL is recommended, with respect to both clinical and cost-effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of five face-to-face smoking cessation interventions: 1) Telephone Counseling (TC), 2) Minimal counseling by a general practitioner (H-MIS), 3) Minimal counseling by a general practitioner combined with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (H-MIS+NRT), 4) Intensive Counseling combined with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (IC+NRT) and 5) Intensive Counseling combined with Bupropion (IC+Bupr), {{in terms of}} costs per quitter, costs per life-year gained and costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Methods: Scenarios on increased implementation of smoking cessation interventions were compared to current practice. <b>Base-case</b> <b>scenarios</b> assumed {{that one of the}} five interventions was implemented for a period of either 1 year, 10 years or 75 years and reached 25 % of the smokers. A computer simulation model, the RIVM Chronic Disease Model, was used to project future gains in life-years and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), and savings of health care costs from a decrease in the incidence of smoking-related diseases. Regardless of the duration for which the intervention was implemented, our time horizon was 75 years, i. e. costs and effects were studied over a period of 75 years. Intervention costs were computed based on bottom up estimates of resource use and costs per unit of resource use. Cost calculations of smoking cessation interventions were carried out from a health care perspective, i. e. total direct medical costs were calculated based on estimates of real resource use. Effectiveness in terms of cessation rates was obtained from Cochrane meta-analyses. For the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> future costs and effects were discounted at an annual percentage of 4 %. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as: (additional intervention costs minus the savings from a reduced incidence of smoking related diseases) / (gain in health outcomes). A series of one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the cost-effectiveness ratios with regard to variations in cessation rates, intervention costs, discount rates, time horizon, and the percentage of smokers reached by the intervention. Results: Base-case estimates for costs per quitter ranged from Euro 443 for H-MIS to Euro 2800 for IC+NRT. Compared to current practice H-MIS is a dominant intervention regardless of the duration of implementation. This means that H-MIS not only generates gains in life years and QALYs but its saving are higher than its intervention costs. The four other interventions had relatively low cost-effectiveness ratios when compared to many other preventive interventions. When implementing each of the interventions for a period of 75 years, their ratios varied from about Euro 1400 per life year gained for TC to Euro 6200 per life year gained for IC+NRT. Incremental costs per QALY gained were Euro 1100 for TC, Euro 1400 for H-MIS+NRT, Euro 3400 for IC+Bupr, and Euro 4, 900 for IC+NRT. Results were most sensitive to the rate of discounting. Conclusions: All five smoking-cessation interventions are very cost-effective, with ratios far below Euro 20000. H-MIS is even cost saving...|$|R

Three {{of the seven}} strategies were based on HCV diagnosis and reporting guidelines in Mexico and four were from previous and current recommendations outlined by the CDC.

Costs were calculated {{from the perspective of}} the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). A decision tree model was developed to estimate the expected number of true positive cases and costs for the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenarios</b> and for the sensitivity analyses. Base-case findings indicate an extended dominance of the CDC-USA 2 and CDC-USA 4 options by the IMSS Mexico 3 and IMSS-Mexico 1 alternatives. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses results suggest that for a willingness-to-pay (WTP) range of $ 0 - 9, 000 USD the IMSS-Mexico 1 strategy is the most cost-effective of all strategies ($ 5, 000 USD per TP). The IMSS-Mexico 3, IMSS-Mexico 2, and CDC-USA 3 strategies are also cost-effective strategies that cost between $ 7, 800 and $ 8, 800 USD per TP case detected.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Many {{climate change}} studies project that {{occurrence}} of droughts (due to dry years) in Southern Africa will increase; this raises concerns over Zambia's electricity system. Currently, over 99 % of Zambia's electricity is supplied by hydropower, which {{is vulnerable to}} droughts. With Zambia targeting to be a middle income industrialised country by 2030, it isimportant that the impacts of droughts on the electricity system are understood, and how the system's adaptive capacity can be improved. This is imperative if the system were to enhance economic development. The main focus of this research therefore, was to {{develop an understanding of}} how Zambia's electricity system would evolve in different economic and climatic scenarios. A comprehensive electricity model for Zambia was developed after reviewing literature on Zambia's electricity sector and energy planning in a developing country context. A Scenario planning approach was used to model and analyse the electricity system that would be required to meet demand in two climatic scenarios (average and dry year river-flows) and for different economic growth scenarios. The results showed that the supply system has to be increased in order to support economic development. In a dry year scenario, the availability of the hydro technologies reduces significantly and this leads to a considerable increase in the average generation cost of the system. The introduction of renewable energy and coal technologies into the system lessens the impacts of droughts. Carbon emitting technologies such as coal and oil are still viable supply options even with a carbon price of $ 50 per tonne. Only low and <b>base-case</b> growth <b>scenarios</b> need an explicit diversification policy since least cost policy in the high growth scenario (the middle income growth trajectory) leads to a diverse supply system. Implementing a diversification policy in the high growth scenario increases average generating cost without improving the system's adaptive capacity. The most cost effective way of increasing the system's adaptive capacity is by importing electricity and gradually increasing share of renewable and coal technologies in the system. Further research on how electricity trade in Southern Africa could be enhanced, should be done...|$|R

To date, no study {{has examined the}} cost-effectiveness of DBS for OCD. OBJECTIVE: To perform the first economic evaluation of DBS for therapy refractory OCD. METHODS: We conducted a 2 -year prospective, open cost-effectiveness study, comparing DBS (n = 17) with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 11), with cost per Quality-Adjusted-Life-Year (QALY) as outcome measure. Apart from the base-case, or primary analysis, we conducted two practice-based scenarios: (1) standard care scenario, without research and innovation costs, and (2) rechargeable scenario, in which we assume {{the use of a}} rechargeable battery. <b>Base-case</b> and both <b>scenarios</b> were extrapolated to four years to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Compared to TAU, DBS provides an additional 0. 26 QALY (SD = 0. 16). Median cost per QALY gained is estimated at € 141, 446 for base-case, € 115, 916 for standard care and € 65, 394 for the rechargeable scenario. Extending the time-horizon to four years results in a median cost per QALY of € 80, 313 for base-case, € 69, 287 for standard care, and turned out to be cost-saving at € 4678 per QALY for the rechargeable scenario. Assuming a willingness to pay threshold of € 80, 000 /QALY, DBS, under base-case and standard care had 25 % and 35 % probability of being more cost-effective than TAU. With the rechargeable scenario and in all scenarios extrapolated to four years, the probability of cost-effectiveness was equal or higher than TAU. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates DBS for OCD is cost-effective in the long-term, especially when rechargeable batteries are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: 1) To improve an {{existing}} COPD model by incorporating {{the distinction between}} mild, moderate, severe and very severe COPD and by quantifying the progression of COPD over these stages 2) To use the improved model to estimate {{the potential impact of}} smoking cessation programs offered to COPD patients and project their effect on the future burden of COPD. Methods: An existing population model for COPD, which is a module of the RIVM Chronic Disease model, was extended with disease progression over time. Prevalent cases in the starting year were distributed over 4 severity stages mild (28 %), moderate (54 %), severe (15 %) and very severe (3 %) (GOLD-classification). The severity distribution was based on data from GP registrations. The COPD incidence was 41 % in mild, 55 % in moderate and 4 % in severe. Disease progression was modelled as annual decline in lung function in FEV 1 % predicted. The Lung Health Study was used to estimate gender, age, smoking and baseline FEV 1 % predicted dependent values of lung function decline and one-time increase in lung function associated with smoking cessation. A meta-analysis was done to obtain severity stage specific mortality rates. The new model was used to project COPD prevalence, mortality and costs by COPD severity stage over the period 2000 - 2025 (the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario).</b> A series of sensitivity analyses was performed to assess the robustness of the results to changes in input data and assumptions. The new model was used to compare two scenarios on increased implementation of two smoking cessation interventions, minimal counselling by the general practioner (H-MIS) and intensive counselling with bupropion (IC+Bupr). They were compared to the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario</b> in terms of life-years, QALYs, interventions costs and savings of COPD-related costs. In the scenarios H-MIS or IC+Bupr was implemented for a period of either 1 year, 10 years or 25 years and reached 25 % of the smokers. Smoking cessation results in a one-time increase in lung function and a lower annual decline in FEV 1 % predicted, which results in less disease progression and less mortality among COPD patients who quit smoking. Future costs and effects of these scenarios were discounted at 4 %. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as (additional intervention costs minus the savings in COPD-related health care costs) / gain in health outcomes. Results: In the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> the total number of COPD patients increases from 300 thousand in 2000 to 490 thousand patients in 2025. Between 2000 and 2025 the prevalence rate of mild COPD increases from 5 to 11 per 1000 inhabitants. The prevalence rate of moderate COPD increases from 11 to 14. For severe COPD the rate increases from 3. 0 to 3. 9 and for very severe COPD the rate increases from 0. 5 to 1. 3. In absolute numbers the increase is highest in mild COPD, but the largest relative increase in prevalence rate is seen in very severe COPD. As a result of the increase in COPD prevalence and aging of the COPD population, all-cause mortality rates per 1000 inhabitants increase in all severity stages. In 2000, total COPD-related health care costs are estimated to be 280 million Euros. In 2025 total costs are projected to be 495 million Euros. Costs for very severe COPD have the highest relative increase. The sensitivity analyses show that the model projections were most sensitive to assumptions about the severity distribution of incidence. Implementation of H-MIS and IC+Bupr results in more mild and moderate and less severe and very severe COPD patients compared to the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario</b> after 25 years. Costs per additional quitter are 700 for H-MIS and 2700 for IC+Bupr. Irrespective of the duration of implementation, H-MIS generates net savings, which indicates that the intervention costs of H-MIS are offset by the savings in COPD-related costs. For IC+Bupr savings do not outweigh the interventions costs. For the years 2000 to 2025 the costs per life-year gained of implementing IC+Bupr for 10 years are estimated to be 12000 Euros. Conclusions: Modelling COPD progression over time proves feasible. The model showed that implementation of H-MIS among COPD patients results in better health outcomes and is cost saving. Implementation of IC+Bupr has higher costs than savings, but is still cost-effective with costs per life-year ranging from 10600 to 24500 depending on the duration of implementation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a thermo-electrical modelling approach for demand response services through Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. The {{starting point of}} the approach is to gain insights on the heating and cooling energy required to keep a building at predefined temperature settings. These studies are supported by the simulation engine EnergyPlus, {{which is used to}} generate <b>base-case</b> (uncontrolled) consumption <b>scenarios.</b> Then, a number of different control actions are simulated to study how the energy demand and the indoor temperature profile of different buildings react to such control actions. The relations between user’s comfort levels and temperature setting point variations and durations of the control are explored for different types of buildings. In order to map thermal loads to electrical loads, synthetic and general models of reversible HVAC devices are developed through a so-called black-box approach, whereby input-output functions are generated to link the equipment performance to indoor and outdoor temperatures in both heating and cooling operation. A mathematical formulation of these performance functions is developed from real data. A flexible demand strategy algorithm that maximises the benefits of flexible heat demand is finally presented. It allows selection of an optimal combination of control strategies for the different devices involved in the analysis. The algorithm is able to select type, number, and duration of operation of the HVAC systems so as to maximise the sought benefits, e. g., support of system balancing task, network constraint management. This can ultimately lead to facilitate efficient integration of intermittent generation and enhance the utilization of existing network assets in future low carbon electricity systems. The present heating and domestic hot water demands of UK residential buildings have been modelled and validated with the national gas consumption. The model is used to predict future HVAC demand of the UK residential building in year 2050. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is an {{economic}} burden associated with hypertension both worldwide and in Vietnam. In Vietnam, patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure are hospitalized for further diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Because {{there is no evidence}} on costs of inpatient care for hypertensive patients available yet to inform policy makers, health insurance and hospitals, this study aims to quantify direct costs of inpatient care for these patients in Vietnam. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in a hospital in Vietnam. Direct costs were analyzed from the health-care provider's perspective. Hospital-based costing was performed using both bottom-up and micro-costing methods. Patients with sole essential or primary hypertension (ICD-code I 10) and those comorbid with sphingolipid metabolism or other lipid storage disorders (ICD-code E 75) were selected. Costs were quantified based on financial and other records of the hospital. Total cost per patient resulted from an aggregation of laboratory test costs, drug costs, inpatient-days' costs and other remaining costs, including appropriate allocation of overheads. Both mean and medians, as well as interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated. In addition to a <b>base-case</b> analysis, specific <b>scenarios</b> were analyzed. Results: 230 patients were included in the study (147 cases with I 10 code only and 83 cases with I 10 combined with E 75). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days. Median total direct costs per patient were US$ 65 (IQR: 37 - 95). Total costs per patient were higher in the combined hypertensive and lipid population than in the sole hypertensive population at US$ 78 and US$ 53, respectively. In all scenarios, hospital inpatient days' costs were identified as the major cost driver in the total costs. Conclusions: Costs of hospitalization of hypertensive patients is relatively high compared to annual medication treatment at a community health station for hypertension {{as well as to the}} total health expenditure per capita in Vietnam. Given that untreated/undetected hypertension likely leads to more expensive treatments of complications, these findings may justify investments by the Vietnamese health-care sector to control high blood pressure in order to save downstream health care budgets...|$|R
40|$|Australia is {{the largest}} per capita {{greenhouse}} gas emitter in the developed world. If it seeks to effectively contribute to its share {{of global climate change}} mitigation, it must make a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency. Bioenergy is one renewable energy technology that could help to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Apart from being a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels when it is produced in an environmentally sound way, it offers many other advantages. The Darling Downs, in south-east Queensland, is a large agricultural and energy-producing region, making it a suitable case study for examining the biophysical impacts of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy alternatives. Stocks and flows modelling is ideally suited to this, as it allows for future alternative scenarios to be created that also examine the effects of the transition on various sectors of the economy. This thesis develops three scenarios to examine the impact of transitioning from fossil fuels to bioenergy on the Darling Downs. First, the <b>base-case</b> or reference <b>scenario</b> reflects current agricultural practices and energy generation. Second, the ethanol scenario involves the construction of four additional first-generation ethanol facilities. Even though it reduced the need for foreign fuel imports, thereby contributing to energy security, the feedstock requirements were beyond the production capacity of the Darling Downs making it untenable considering the importance of grain production within the region and concerns about sustainability/land use change. Third, the electricity scenario involves replacing coal partially or totally with biomass in the two existing coal-fired power stations in the region. Only this scenario saw a large decrease in greenhouse gas emissions; however, the large feedstock requirements resulted in a large decrease in grain production thereby requiring a level of cofiring between 10 and 100 per cent.

Since the adoption of a policy of trade liberalisation and the shift towards a free market for agricultural products, the actual cropping patterns of grain crops have moved closer to the expected optimum production pattern. It is shown that the total area cultivated will decrease by 2, 4 percent. Results show that except for the area under sunflower (that remains unchanged) and yellow maize that increases, the area utilised by other crops will decrease. Fertiliser use is directly correlated with production patterns in the provinces. A comparison of the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario</b> and optimum solution revealed that the movement from a base to an optimum solution results in a drop in total area cultivated, production and exports. Fertiliser use correspondingly decreases. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Clinical {{trials have}} shown rofecoxib, a {{selective}} inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase- 2, {{to be associated}} with fewer gastrointestinal complications than non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Objective: To evaluate the potential clinical and economic consequences of rofe-coxib prescription in Ontario, Canada, for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) aged> 65 years who did not respond to paracetamol (acetaminophen) therapy. Design: Decision analytic modelling study. Methods: A model was constructed to compare rofecoxib and nonselective NSAIDs with respect to their gastrointestinal complications in patients with OA. The model had a 1 -year horizon and considered direct medical costs {{from the perspective of the}} Ontario Ministry of Health. Event rates were estimated from a pooled analysis of 8 phase IIb/III clinical trials. The number of perforations, ulcers and bleeds (PUBs) with each strategy was used as the primary measure of effec-tiveness. Results: In the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> the expected total cost per patient-day on nonselective NSAIDs was 1. 60 Canadian dollars ($Can) versus $Can 1. 67 o...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. We {{undertook}} a decision analysis {{to evaluate the}} economic and health effects and incremental cost-effectiveness of using targeted tuberculin skin testing, compared with universal screening or no screening, before kindergarten. METHODS. We constructed a decision tree to determine the costs and clinical outcomes of using targeted testing compared with universal screening or no screening. Baseline estimates for input parameters {{were taken from the}} medical literature and from California health jurisdiction data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine plausible ranges of associated outcomes and costs. We surveyed California health jurisdictions to determine the prevalence of mandatory universal tuberculin skin testing. RESULTS. In our <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> the cost to prevent an additional case of tuberculosis by using targeted testing, compared with no screening, was 524897. The cost to prevent an additional case by using universal screening, compared with targeted testing, was 671398. The incremental cost of preventing a case through screening remained above 100000 unless the prevalence of tuberculin skin testing positivity increased to > 10...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The gradual {{increase}} of persons living with HIV, mainly {{due to the}} reduced mortality achieved with effective antiretroviral therapies, calls for increased rationality and awareness in health resources consumption also during the early illness phases. Aim of this work is the estimation of the budget impact related to the variation in backbone prescribing trends in naïve patients. METHODS: Target population {{is the number of}} patients starting antiretroviral therapy each year, according to the Italian HIV surveillance registry, excluding patients receiving non-authorized or non-recommended regimens. We modeled 3 -year mortality and durability rates on a dynamic cohort, basing on international literature. A prevalent patients analysis has also been conducted, for which the model is fed by a closed cohort consisting of all the patients without experience of virologic failure. The aim of this collateral analysis is to estimate the difference in current annual expenditures if the past prescription trends for patients starting therapy would have led to the evaluated hypothetical scenarios. Current Italian market shares of triple regimens containing first-choice or alternative backbones (tenofovir/emtricitabine, abacavir/lamivudine, tenofovir/lamivudine and zidovudine/lamivudine) are compared to three hypothetical <b>scenarios</b> (<b>base-case,</b> minimum and maximum) in which increasing shares of patients eligible to abacavir/lamivudine start first line treatment with this backbone. Annual cost for each regimen comprises drugs acquisition under hospital pricing rules, monitoring exams and preventive tests, valued basing on regional reimbursement tariffs. RESULTS: According to current prescribing trends, in the next three years about 13, 000 patients starting HIV therapy will receive tenofovir/emtricitabine (83 % of the target population), and minor portions other regimens (9 % abacavir/lamivudine, 8 % zidovudine/lamivudine). Patients that would be eligible to abacavir/lamivudine are 1. 5, 4. 5 and 6 thousand more than those presently treated according to the three hypothetical scenarios, leading to a cumulative saving of 850 thousand, 2. 4 million and 3. 3 million euro, respectively. If in the past the same modification of first line prescription trend was adopted, the annual current cost saving would vary from 922 thousands to 7. 3 million euro. Most of this amount is due to reduced acquisition costs and, secondarily, to lower monitoring needs. CONCLUSION: Where patient features don’t force the choice of the backbone, abacavir/lamivudine prescription may induce substantial savings, allowing the release of resources needed to manage more complicated/advanced cases.

40|$|In October 1999, {{the working}} {{families}} ’ tax credit (WFTC) replaced family credit {{as the main}} package of in-work support for families with children. Among a range of stated aims, the WFTC is intended to ‘ … improve work incentives, encouraging people without work to move into employment’. In this paper, we consider the impact of WFTC on hours and participation. To simulate labour supply responses, we use a discrete behavioural model of household labour supply with controls for fixed and childcare costs, and unobserved heterogeneity. In simulation, we experiment {{with a number of}} scenarios regarding the take-up of the credit, entry wage level and hourly childcare price. We find participation rates among single mothers to increase by around 2. 2 percentage points for the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> while for married women participation rates are modelled to fall.

40|$|Integrated urban {{models are}} {{designed}} to simulate land-use and transportation interactions and to allow predicts of traffic volume and vehicle emissions at the link level of the urban transport network. As such, these models can address the weakness of existing systems. The Integrated Model of Urban LAnd-use and Transportation for Environmental analysis is an operational urban model calibrated for the Census Metropolitan Area of Hamilton. This paper extends this model to include air pollution estimation and mapping of vehicle air pollutants, employing a dispersion model and spatial data analysis. The approach provides an integrated framework for impact assessment of land-use and transport policies on traffic flows, emissions, and pollutant concentration, enabling the evaluation of population exposure to traffic related pollution. The study illustrates how vehicle-generated carbon monoxide concentration can be estimated and mapped using the proposed approach under a <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario</b> for the 2006. Several development and transportation scenaria can be developed and ‘hot-spots’ of traffic-originated air pollution can be identified and visualized within a Geographic Information System framework...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{analyses}} {{the projected}} improvements in urban air quality for 2015 {{in the coastal}} city of Barcelona (north–eastern Iberian Peninsula). To do so, the WRF–ARW/HERMES/CMAQ modelling system is applied at very high resolution (1 km x 1 km and 1 hour). The analysis is done by projecting the emissions of a <b>base–case</b> <b>scenario</b> defined for 2004 to three different future scenarios for 2015, each one representing {{a different set of}} traffic mobility management measures. Such measures integrate re–distribution of the current urban road network into “super– square blocks” as well as redirecting the traffic. The study is made more consistent by considering specific projections per sector of emission, mainly focusing on the vehicular fleet (introduction of technological improvements and the use of alternative fuels). The results of comparing the base–case versus the future scenarios indicate that the mobility management measures, technological improvements, use of alternative fuels and projection of emissions from different sectors will help to reduce the mean concentrations of atmospheric pollutants in downtown Barcelona, and also in the outskirts and in the metropolitan area...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundClostridium difficile {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} nosocomial pathogens, causing severe gastrointestinal disease in hospitalized patients. Although "bundled" interventions have been proposed and promoted, optimal control strategies remain unknown. MethodsWe designed an agent-based computer simulation of nosocomial C. difficile transmission and infection, which included components such as: patients and health care workers, and their interactions; room contamination via C. difficile shedding; C. difficile hand carriage and removal via hand hygiene; patient acquisition of C. difficile via contact with contaminated rooms or health care workers; and patient antimicrobial use. We then introduced six interventions, alone and "bundled" together: aggressive C. difficile testing; empiric isolation and treatment of symptomatic patients; improved adherence to hand hygiene and contact precautions; improved use of soap and water for hand hygiene; and improved environmental cleaning. All interventions were tested using values representing base-case, typical intervention, and optimal intervention scenarios. FindingsIn the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> C. difficile infection rates ranged from 822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 21 cases/ 10, 000 patient-days, with a case detection fraction between 32...|$|E
40|$|Agent-based {{modeling}} (ABM) is {{a computer}} simulation approach {{that can be used}} to represent real-world systems and create planning scenarios to examine possible future outcomes of present-day decisions. This approach can be applied in tourism planning, where destinations are exposed to a variety of externalities, and must develop strategies to adapt to changing operational conditions. We describe the development of TourSim, an ABM of tourism dynamics set in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. We present an overview of the data sources and techniques used to inform agent behavior and the destination landscape, as well as consider aspects of system representation and validation and how these may affect the use of TourSim. TourSim is used to generate three scenarios of tourism dynamics; a <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> one that simulates the effect of a decrease in visitation from American markets as a result of economic crisis, and the use of advertising as a response to this lower level of visitation. These scenarios are used to evaluate ABM in comparison with other computer-based methods of modeling tourism, namely geographic information systems and system dynamics models. ...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{railway track}} {{maintenance}} costs comprise between 25 - 35 {{percent of total}} freight train operating costs. Track maintenance planning models {{have been shown to}} reduce maintenance costs by 5 to 10 percent though improved planning. This paper describes a model which has been developed to deal with the track maintenance planning function at the medium to long-term levels. This model simulates the impacts of degrading railway track conditions and related maintenance work, in contrast to tradition models that mainly use expert systems. The model simulates the degrading track condition using an existing track degradation model. Track condition data from that model is used to determine if safety related speed restrictions are needed and what immediate maintenance work may be required for safe train operations. The model outputs the net present value of the benefits of undertaking a given maintenance strategy, when compared with a <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario.</b> The model approach has advantages over current models in investigating what if scenarios.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a model of presymptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) after a screening diagnostic evaluation and explored the circumstances required for an AD prevention treatment to produce aggregate net population benefit. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to estimate outcomes in a simulated population derived from data on AD incidence and mortality. A wide variety of treatment parameters were explored. Net population benefit was estimated in aggregated QALYs. Sensitivity analyses were performed by individually varying the primary parameters. In the <b>base-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> treatment effects were uniformly positive, and net benefits increased with increasing age at screening. A highly efficacious treatment (i. e. relative risk 0. 6) modeled in the base-case is estimated to save 20 QALYs per 1000 patients screened and 221 QALYs per 1000 patients treated. Highly efficacious presymptomatic screen and treat strategies for AD are likely to produce substantial aggregate population benefits that are likely greater than the benefits of aspirin in primary prevention of moderate risk cardiovascular disease (28 QALYS per 1000 patients treated), even {{in the context of}} an imperfect treatment delivery environment...|$|E
