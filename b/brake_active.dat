40|$|Increase the {{probability}} of prevent road accidents by installing autonomous systems in a vehicles is the current trend {{in the field of}} active safety with a focus on pedestrian safety. The work deals with the evaluation of intervention of active safety systém for pedestrian detection assembled in series production. Benefit of active safety systems to prevent road accidents can be achieved, for example, early warning driver of a potential collision situation sufficiently in advance to reaction and post-maneuver (braking, yaw, [...] ). The evaluation of the intervention of active safety systems, which aim to prevent an accident with a pedestrian is necessary to experimentally evaluate the behavior of these systems. The main objective of this work is to test the selected systém based on different types of reál accidents. Atthe time of the measurements and present, are not for experts and specialists in the field of road traffic accidents publicly accessible data about the behavior of such a systém. The work aims to evaluate the behavior of the Volvo systém in inducing reál traffic situations. For the evaluation of this systém are precisely analyzed fatal traffic accidents with pedestrians in the urban area (speed of vehicles up to 60 km/h). Simulated traffic situations by their nature cover the most common critical situations in urban traffic. Expert community and the professionals who deal with the solution of traffic accidents receive this work valuable data to deal with such accidents. Based on these measurements give more expert input data to solve a collision with a pedestrian. The basis for understanding the behavior are created graphs of distance, speed and time at a key moment of the collision. These key moments include entry a pedestrians to driving corridor of the vehicle, system's response to conflict situations, warn the driver and then autonomously <b>brake</b> <b>active</b> safety systé...|$|E

30|$|Differential <b>braking</b> and <b>active</b> {{steering}} {{have already}} been integrated to overcome their shortcomings. However, existing research mainly focuses on two-axle vehicles and controllers are mostly designed to use one control method to improve the other. Moreover, many experiments are needed to improve the robustness; therefore, these control methods are underutilized. This paper proposes an integrated control system specially designed for multi-axle vehicles, in which the desired lateral force and yaw moment of vehicles {{are determined by the}} sliding mode control algorithm. The output of the sliding mode control is distributed to the suitable wheels based on the abilities and potentials of the two control methods. Moreover, in this method, fewer experiments are needed, and the robustness and simultaneity are both guaranteed. To simplify the optimization system and to improve the computation speed, seven simple optimization subsystems are designed for the determination of control outputs on each wheel. The simulation results show that the proposed controller obviously enhances the stability of multi-axle trucks. The system improves 68 % of the safe velocity, and its performance is much better than both differential <b>braking</b> and <b>active</b> steering. This research proposes an integrated control system that can simultaneously invoke differential <b>braking</b> and <b>active</b> steering of multi-axle vehicles to fully utilize the abilities and potentials of the two control methods.|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complex. A modern car, for example, requires a multitude of control tasks, such as <b>braking,</b> <b>active</b> suspension, and collision avoidance. These tasks not only exhibit different degrees of safety criticality but also change their criticalities as the driving mode changes. For instance, the suspension task is {{a critical part of}} the stability of the car at high speed, but it is only a comfort feature at low speed. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure timing guarantees for the system with respect to the tasks’ criticalities, not only within each mode but also during mode changes. This paper presents a partitioned multi-processor scheduling scheme for multi-modal mixed-criticality real-time systems. Our scheme consists of a packing algorithm and a scheduling algorithm for each processor that take into account both mode changes and criticalities. The packing algorithm maximizes the schedulable utilization across modes using the sustained criticality of each task, which captures the overall criticality of the task across modes. The scheduling algorithm combines Rate-Monotonic scheduling with a mode transition enforcement mechanism that relies on the transitional zero-slack instants of tasks to control low-criticality tasks during mode changes, so as to preserve the schedulability of high-criticality tasks. We also present an implementation of our scheduler in the Linux operating system, as well as an experimental evaluation to illustrate its practicality. Our evaluation shows that our scheme can provide close to twice as much tolerance to overloads (ductility) compared to a mode-agnostic scheme...|$|R

In the field of two-wheeled vehicles the spread of electronic control systems its still in its infancy, as today only a few commercial motorbikes are equipped with Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). Moreover, the few ABS systems available are certified to work only when panic braking occurs on straight road. As will be shown, to guarantee safety when braking on curves, the designed controller needs to rely on an online measure of the vehicle roll angle.

40|$|Modern {{active safety}} systems on road {{vehicles}} are capable of sophisticated motion control, e. g. for emergency braking, collision avoidance etc. - assisting or potentially overriding the driver to make speed and/or path corrections. The availability of multiple actuators - especially individual wheel <b>braking,</b> <b>active</b> front steering - enables an agile response from the vehicle, even {{compared to that of}} the most skilled human driver. For collision avoidance, a typical control approach is to: (a) define a reference geometric path that avoids collision; (b) apply low level control to perform path following. However {{there are a number of}} limitations in this approach, addressed in the current paper. First, it is typically unknown whether the reference path is feasible or over-conservative. Secondly, the control scheme is not well suited to avoiding a moving object, e. g. another vehicle. Further, any incorrect choice of reference path may degrade performance, fast adaptation to friction change is not easy to implement and the associated low-level control allocation may be computationally intensive. In this paper we make use of a particle model for initial path planning and guidance, coupled with a simplified optimal controller, used for control integration and low-level actuation. The particle trajectory is only used as a starting point for control integration; the trajectory is not required to be followed. Instead, motion is maximized in a preferred direction away from possible collision, so the particle trajectory is used for prioritization rather than strict guidance. The aim of the present paper is to show the general feasibility of a simple control algorithm based on a linear Hamiltonian function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} a dynamic control {{allocation}} approach is presented for an automotive vehicle yaw stabilization scheme. The stabilization strategy {{consists of a}} high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tire-road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module that generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low level brake control module and commands front wheel steering angle corrections. The control allocation design is such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated form the high level module, with desirable distribution of control forces satisfying actuator constraints and minimal control effort objectives. Conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given for the case when the control allocation includes adaptation of the tire-road maximal friction coefficients, and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic non linear multi body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the yaw control allocation strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme maneuvers where the non linear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise (without <b>active</b> <b>braking</b> or <b>active</b> steering) becomes unstable {{in the sense of}} over- or under steering. The control allocation implementation is efficient and suitable for low cost automotive electronic control units. I...|$|R
