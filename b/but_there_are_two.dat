25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even {{something as simple as}} drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{principles}} of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum p of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by differentiation). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.|$|E
25|$|The {{west coast}} of Little Sark is rocky, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> notable beaches {{to the north and}} east. The beach of Pot Bay {{stretches}} along the east coast from north of Brenière to Avocat Point, but this is a minor attraction compared to La Grande Grève, Sark's largest and most popular beach, which lies along the north coast of Little Sark and is normally accessible via steps cut in La Coupée (after a landslip temporarily closed the steps down to the shore a second way down has now (2016) been prepared and is usable). There are also popular swimming spots at the Venus Pool and Adonis Pool. The former (or Venus's Bath, as it is also known), named as such by Victorian artist William Toplis, lies close to the southeasternmost point of Little Sark. Protected and overhung by granite cliffs, it is largely free from prevailing winds and is a fine swimming spot. Completely covered by the sea at high tide, a low tide a circular pool originally some eighteen feet (five metres) deep (recent rockfalls have decreased its depth substantially) is separated from the sea. A smaller pool, Cupid's Bath, is also found nearby. The Adonis Pool is a similar tidal pool, though deeper, larger and less easily accessible than the Venus Pool; it is located close to the southwesternmost tip of Little Sark. The Adonis Pool enjoys longer periods of sunshine then the Venus Pool but is separated from the mainland at anything approaching half tide (the pool is covered by the sea at high tide) by a deep and fast flowing race of water where visitors require experience or careful instruction to cross to the Adonis rock safely.|$|E

500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies are {{developed}} by finding relationships between variables in one domain {{that have a}} mathematical form identical to variables in the other domain. [...] There is no one, unique way of doing this; numerous analogies are theoretically possible, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> analogies that are widely used: the impedance analogy and the mobility analogy. [...] The impedance analogy makes force and voltage analogous while the mobility analogy makes force and current analogous. [...] By itself, that {{is not enough to}} fully define the analogy, a second variable must be chosen. [...] A common choice is to make pairs of power conjugate variables analogous. [...] These are variables which when multiplied together have units of power. [...] In the impedance analogy, for instance, this results in force and velocity being analogous to voltage and current respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the Haflinger horse traces to the Middle Ages. Origins of the breed are uncertain, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> main theories. The first is that Haflingers descend from horses {{abandoned}} in the Tyrolean valleys in central Europe by East Goths fleeing from Byzantine troops {{after the fall of}} Conza in 555AD. [...] These abandoned horses are believed to have been influenced by Oriental bloodlines and may help explain the Arabian physical characteristics seen in the Haflinger. A type of light mountain pony was first recorded in the Etsch Valley in 1282, and was probably the ancestor of the modern Haflinger. The second theory is that they descended from a stallion from the Kingdom of Burgundy sent to Margrave Louis of Brandenburg by his father, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, when the Margrave married Princess Margarete Maultasch of the Tyrol in 1342. It has also been suggested that they descend from the prehistoric Forest horse. Haflingers have close connections to the Noriker, a result of the overlapping geographic areas where the two breeds were developed. [...] Whatever its origins, the breed developed in a mountainous climate and was well able to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal maintenance.|$|E
500|$|Maiden Castle has no {{artificial}} defences on {{its northern}} and western sides {{because of the}} naturally steep slope of the hill, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> artificial banks, [...] apart.

There is no evidence that Maiden Castle was protected by a ditch along with the banks. The main entrance is on the east side of the fort where the inner bank turns in towards the fort, and while there is a gap in the outer rampart it does not turn in. There may also be two other entrances to the site where the banks meet the cliffs to the north and south; the outer ditch runs inwards at both ends, possibly indicating an in-turned entrance abutting the edge of the cliff similar to the entrance at the Helsby hill fort also in Cheshire or perhaps an attempt to make the banks run flush to the cliff-edge to ensure there were no gaps in the site's defences.|$|E

500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{change in the}} battle mechanics is the introduction of double battles, in which the opposing parties each use two Pokémon at the same time. Consequently, certain Pokémon moves can affect multiple combatants at once. Multi battles were added alongside double battles. [...] They are identical to double battle, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> trainers to a side, each controlling {{one of the two}} Pokémon sent out. [...] Also new to the games are innate abilities and natures; the former is shared by every Pokémon of a certain species, while the latter may vary among a particular species. Abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle, such as immunity against certain types of moves or strengthening a certain type of move. Natures, like innate abilities, affect the strength of Pokémon in battle; however, they affect the stats of the Pokémon rather than directly affecting the strength of the moves. Another stat introduced in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is Condition, an important factor in Pokémon Contests, mini-games in which participants perform moves before a judge. Both Pokémon and their moves have a Condition, which is increased by using Pokéblocks (candies made from berries). Ruby and Sapphire were the first games to have different weather conditions (sunny, rain, hail, and sandstorm), and these affected battle in unique ways. [...] Secret bases were added as a one off feature where players could open up a hole in the world and customize the place with various items picked up in game. [...] Players who linked up with others who set up secret bases were able to battle an NPC version of that trainer within their secret base.|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone gave a mixed {{review of}} the album, {{wondering}} why the remix album was necessary {{to be released in}} the first place. She nevertheless added that [...] "he album has some diverting moments. Goldfrapp's down-tempo 'Judas' is less a remix than a smart cover, and the Weeknd and Illangelo re-imagine 'Marry the Night' as a strobe-y, atmospheric R epic. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> or three duds for each winner—like the bludgeoning 'Scheiße', a gratuitous exercise that strives to make a dance-floor thumper out of a song that was born that way." [...] Rosen's view was shared by Paul Rice from Slant Magazine, who gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Rice's main complaint was that [...] "ertain artists cry out for the remix treatment more than others, usually those whose vocal talents are relatively straightforward and could benefit from the extra fuss." [...] He added that Gaga was not such an artist and that the original Born This Way album [...] "in particular, is too big and untamed, full of too many of its own references and styles, from Springsteen to Madonna. As such, it's best enjoyed on its own flawed, bombastic terms." [...] Nick Levine, reviewing the album for BBC Music felt that most of the tracks are already available as digital downloads and CD singles, [...] "so it's easy to dismiss Born This Way: The Remix as inessential and, yes, a cash-in. But taken as a whole, this release offers enough revelations to suggest the original album is worth revisiting. That additional purpose, whether intentional or not, feels at least partly fulfilled." [...] Levine complimented The Weeknd and Twin Shadow's remixes, while criticizing Foster the People and Sultan & Ned Shepard for their predictable remixes.|$|E
500|$|An {{additional}} specimen {{was described}} as a possible Sphecomyrma male, but it was never assigned to a specific species. The specimen numbered AMNH NJ-242 was collected from the White Oaks outcrop in 1995 and is currently preserved in the [...] American Museum of Natural History. The entire body of the male specimen is completely preserved. As most ant genera are based on the morphology of workers, assigning males to a species or a genus is rarely done unless they are taken from a colony. However, its size, petiole structure, the absence of the trochantellus and basal antennal structure are similar to that of a Sphecomyrma worker. It is a small ant, measuring [...] with three ocelli present on the vertex. Stiff hairs can be found on its frons and vertex. It has large eyes and the face has two pairs of long setae along with smaller setae. The scape is short and is around the same length as the flagellomere (one of the three main segments of the antenna); the pedicel is only slightly longer than the flagellomere by 0.3 times, and the total length of the antenna is [...] Most of its mouthparts are covered in bubbles from the amber, but two palpals (a pair of appendages found near the mouth) are seen protruding. The mesosoma is [...] in length and the petiole is , which has pairs of long setae on the apex of the nodus. Both tibias have a pair of setose and the apical spurs on the hind tibia is pectinate. The forewings measure [...] and the hindwings are 0.7 times the length of the forewings. The shape of the wings is consistent with other formicids. The hindwings have seven hamuli but none is found around the anterior portions. The gaster is [...] long and the first and second segments are equally as long as each other (these two segments alone cover two-thirds of the gaster).
