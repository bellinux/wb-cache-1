2500|$|Jacobi's Über die Lehre des Spinozas (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) {{expressed}} his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the enmity of the <b>Berlin</b> <b>group,</b> led by Mendelssohn. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God {{are said to}} be nothing but extended substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that pantheism shares more characteristics of theism than of atheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{established}} {{congregation of}} Berlin viewed {{all this with}} apprehension. Rabbi Akiva Eger of Posen, perhaps the generation's greatest halakhic authority, published a short rebuke. He condemned the use of German in prayer, though not any other innovation, and castigated the <b>Berlin</b> <b>group</b> for wishing to emulate the [...] "Ordinances of the Gentiles" [...] ("neither shall ye walk in their ordinances"). The chief rabbi of Berlin, Meyer Simon Weyl, launched a formal protest to the government, utilizing a legal clause that allowed prayer only in the single recognized synagogue. On orders of King Frederick William III, both private temples were closed on 9 December 1815. Beer concluded that the only possible course of action was to vie for influence in the main prayerhouse. Seeking approbation for the reformed service, he sent enquiries to several rabbis in Italy, where he had business contacts. He did not explicitly describe the situation in Berlin, but vaguely asked about the permissibility of various practices. Italian communities, well acculturated and integrated, served {{as a matter of}} particular interest to German Jews, apart to their penchant for all things Sephardic. They had a long tradition of instrumental music in their synagogues, since the days of Salamone Rossi, making them an excellent precedent.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1942, the Nazi {{authorities}} in Riga decided the German ghetto {{was getting too}} crowded and organized a massacre which {{has come to be}} called the [...] "Dünamünde Action". (The word [...] "action" [...] was a euphemism employed by the Germans to describe mass shootings and later this was picked up by the ghetto inmates themselves.) [...] The Nazis ordered each of the groups in the German ghetto to prepare a list of between 60 and 120 people for further [...] "resettlement", with the <b>Berlin</b> <b>group</b> required to name 600. The Nazis informed the Judenrat that the people, who were mostly unable to work, being either elderly, infirm, or mothers with young children, would go to a supposed town called Dünamünde to work at fish processing. This was a ruse put together by Obersturmführer Gerhard Maywald. There was no longer a town called Dünamünde, there had not been one for several decades. The ruse succeeded, many people were anxious to go. Despite the Germans only calling for 1,500 to be selected, Sunday March 15, 1942, saw about 1,900 Jews assembled in the streets of the ghetto, including, as with the Rumbula massacre, many parents with small children. There was to be no resettlement of any kind. [...] Instead the people were taken by motor transport to Biķernieki forest {{on the north side of}} Riga, where they were shot and buried in common unmarked graves.|$|E
