5|$|The use {{of small}} and large fish in the local economy was analyzed. Researchers found that while the less common large fish are sold for profit, the diet of Pak Mun villagers {{consisted}} mostly of small fish which can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> both the wet and dry seasons. Small fish are eaten, sold, and traded with the hill peoples for rice.|$|E
5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara {{was estimated to be}} at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations {{of the loss of}} carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{breeding}} habits of O. stramineus; a pregnant female carrying four young <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> September; and a juvenile <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> August suggesting that mating may have occurred in June or July.|$|R

5|$|Yonekura {{and his men}} {{had reached}} Kaiapit after an {{exhausting}} night march. Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern was not to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began serialisation in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds to page 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue {{take place}} in the region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item. Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in a body of water, while Zubat can only <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a cave.|$|E

If the ball <b>is</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> {{the front of}} the court, it must be {{returned}} with a one-arm side-throw.If the ball <b>is</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the back half of the court, the ball must be returned with a two-handed, overhead pass.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E

25|$|The {{waters of}} Swatara Creek were heavily {{polluted}} by runoff from the coal mines and sewage {{from the nearby}} municipalities. Over the years the water quality has gradually improved and there are now some fish living {{in the waters of}} Swatara Creek. Smallmouth bass and panfish can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> Swatara Creek. Irving's Pond is the home to largemouth bass and some panfish. Cold water species of fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> Trout Run and other tributaries of Swatara Creek.|$|E

5000|$|An {{estimated}} 1 in 2 million lobsters are blue. A {{genetic mutation}} causes a blue lobster {{to produce an}} excessive amount of a particular protein. The protein and a red carotenoid molecule known as astaxanthin combine to form a blue complex known as crustacyanin, giving the lobster its blue color. In 2009 a blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> New Hampshire; in 2011, two blue lobsters <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> Canada, one off of Prince Edward Island, and another in the Esgenoôpetitj First Nation territory in New Brunswick; another <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> May 2012 off Nova Scotia.
