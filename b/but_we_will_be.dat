500|$|Thin Lizzy, {{along with}} support band The Answer, were to support AC/DC at stadium shows in England, Ireland and Scotland {{at the end}} of June 2009, but these {{appearances}} were cancelled after drummer Aldridge broke his collarbone in an accident. On 30 June, the band's website confirmed that Sykes had left Thin Lizzy and all shows for the rest of 2009 were cancelled or postponed. Gorham stated that he would announce Thin Lizzy's future plans shortly. In a statement, he said, [...] "It's been a very tough time of late for myself and the band, firstly with drummer Tommy Aldridge's injury and now the subsequent decision for John {{and the rest of the}} group to go their separate ways. I can only apologise to everyone who has supported us over the years, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> back up to full speed soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said in {{his press}} conference: [...] "The game will be {{competitive}}. Prestige comes into it, pride comes into it, so it is always competitive when we play Arsenal." [...] He {{wanted to use the}} game as a means of preparing his team for their UEFA Champions League third qualifying round game against Dinamo București the following Wednesday. Ferguson was concerned about the state of his squad, with several first team players injured. He was irked that senior players Cristiano Ronaldo and Gabriel Heinze were absent, on duty for their respective national teams at the Summer Olympics: [...] "Apparently, it's supposed to be for amateurs, and money earned is put in trust, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> paying their wages while they are away so I don't know what that's all about." ...|$|E

6000|$|Again {{there was}} no faintest {{hesitation}} on Don Diego's part. [...] "You have reason to ask," [...] said he, and sighed. [...] "I had hope' {{it would not be}} observe'. I have been careless--oh, of a carelessness very culpable. I neglect observation. Always it is my way. I make too sure. I count too much on dead reckoning. And so to-day I find when at last I take out the quadrant that we do come by a half-degree too much south, so that Curacao is now almost due north.

No scientific people, as I told you at first, have taken any notice of the more or less temporary phenomena of which I have to-night given you register. But, from the constant arrangements of the universe, the same respecting which the thinkers of former time {{came to the conclusion}} that they were essentially good, and to end in good, the modern speculator arrives at the quite opposite and extremely uncomfortable conclusion that they are essentially evil, and to end--in nothing.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2013, TV Land {{announced}} {{that there would}} be no TV Land Awards for that year.

40|$|The {{student is}} urged to be {{independent}} in scholarly endeavor.

I shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would.

6000|$|... "Now, Miss Oliver dear, do {{not take}} that view of it," [...] {{deprecated}} Susan. [...] "We have not had much to rejoice over of late and yet men were being killed just the same. Do not let yourself slump like poor Cousin Sophia. She said, when the word came, 'Ah, it {{is nothing but a}} rift in the clouds.

'Well, Sophia Crawford,' said I,--for I will never give in to her, Mrs. Dr. dear--'God himself cannot make two hills without a hollow between them, as I have heard it said, but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them.' But Cousin Sophia moaned on. 'Here is the Gallipolly expedition a failure and the Grand Duke Nicholas sent off, and everyone knows the Czar of Rooshia is a pro-German and the Allies have no ammunition and Bulgaria is going against us. And the end is not yet, for England and France must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes.' 'I think myself,' I said, 'that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud, {{and it seems to me}} that the Huns should have a few sins to repent of also.' 'They are instruments in the hands of the Almighty, to purge the garner,' said Sophia. And then I got mad, Mrs. Dr. dear, and told her I did not and never would believe that the Almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever, and that I did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of Holy Writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation. She was not, I told her, a minister or even an elder. And for the time being I squelched her, Mrs. Dr. dear. Cousin Sophia has no spirit. She is very different from her niece, Mrs. Dean Crawford over-harbour. You know the Dean Crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy. All the connection and especially Dean Crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl; but Mrs. Dean just laughed and said, 'Everywhere I went this summer I saw the sign [...] "MEN WANTED" [...] staring me in the face. Do you think I could go and have a girl under such circumstances?' There is spirit for you, Mrs. Dr. dear. But Cousin Sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder." ...|$|E
