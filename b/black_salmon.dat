40|$|Spawning period, total fecundity, egg size, and {{fertilization}} and hatching {{rates of}} wild and hatch- ery-reared <b>Black</b> Sea <b>salmon</b> (Salmo trutta labrax Pallas, 1811) were investigated. Wild brood- stock consisted of 15 females (4 - 5 years old) {{with a mean}} weight of 1773. 2 ± 1014. 4 g. Hatchery- reared broodstock consisted of 28 females (3 years old) with a mean weight of 869. 5 ± 319. 6 g. The spawning period lasted from mid-November {{to the beginning of}} January.

50|$|The <b>Black</b> Sea <b>salmon</b> (Salmo labrax) is {{a fairly}} small species of salmon, at about 20 in long on average and rarely {{reaching}} over 30 in. It inhabits the northern Black Sea coasts and inflowing rivers. There are anadromous, lacustrine and resident river populations. This fish is a close relative of the brown trout. While {{it is the only}} native species of Salmo present in the northern Black Sea basin, it may hybridize with (introduced) brown trout in the major rivers. Sea-run populations are currently at low numbers, but the resident river stocks are doing well.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{a decline in the}} numbers of native fish species, which includes: bull trout, westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern whitefish, and northern pikeminnow.

50|$|Although much of {{the area}} is {{controlled}} by New York State, small, privately owned parcels exist, and most permanent residences are located near state highways or maintained county roads. While hunting camps in the back country areas of the Tug Hill region that are maintained during the hunting season often do not possess electricity or indoor plumbing, the majority of permanent residences in the area feature these amenities. Few roads or villages exist in these more remote areas, and undeveloped reaches of the region are a haven for wildlife, including deer, rabbits, beavers, turkeys, fishers, bobcats, coyote, and the occasional <b>black</b> bear. <b>Salmon,</b> trout, bass, walleye, and waterfowl {{can be found in}} the Tug Hill's abundant waterways.|$|R
50|$|Alaska {{has quite}} a variety of fish species. Its lakes, rivers, and oceans are home to fish such as trout, salmon, char, grayling, halibut, lampreys, lingcod, longnose sucker, pacific hake, pacific herring, pike, <b>black</b> rockfish, <b>salmon</b> shark, sculpin, walleye pollock, white sturgeon, and whitefish. Every year, the salmon {{participate}} in the great spawning migration up against the river currents. They do this in large numbers and are frequently seen jumping out of the water. This is a physical effort of them trying to go against the current. Bears, particularly brown bears, {{take advantage of this}} event by swarming to the rivers, and indulging in the salmon feast. Bear Lake, near Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, has been the site of salmon enhancement activities since 1962.|$|R
50|$|Some ichthyofauna species, such as anchovy, garfish, Black Sea whiting and pickerel, {{visit the}} Sea of Azov from the Black Sea for spawning. This was {{especially}} frequent in 1975-77 when the salinity {{of the southern}} Sea of Azov was unusually high, and additional species were seen such as bluefish, turbot, chuco, spurdog, <b>Black</b> Sea <b>salmon,</b> mackerel and even corkwing wrasse, rock hopper, bullhead and eelpout. Unlike the Black Sea plankton which does not adapt well to the low salinity of the Sea of Azov and concentrates near the Kerch Strait, fishes and invertebrates of the Black Sea adjust well. They are often stronger than the native species, are used to the relatively low temperatures of the Black Sea and survive winter in the Sea of Azov well.|$|R
50|$|Exhibits in {{the center}} cover the history of Mendenhall Glacier, showing how it covered the valley {{at the time when}} Joseph Whidbey, master of the HMS Discovery during George Vancouver's 1791-95 expedition, {{explored}} the area in 1794. This is contrasted with current conditions today, related to climate change. The exhibits also depict the variety of wildlife in the area including mountain goats, <b>black</b> bears, and <b>salmon</b> in the nearby streams. Rangers provide interpretive information and children's nature programs, point out wildlife, and answer questions about the area.|$|R
50|$|The fish {{population}} is managed and substantial sport fishing is practiced, with anglers targeting smelt, lake trout and smallmouth bass. Fish species {{present in the}} lake include lake trout, landlocked salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, smelt, alewife, atlantic <b>salmon,</b> <b>black</b> crappie, bluegill, pickerel, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch.
