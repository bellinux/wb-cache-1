25|$|Abner Louima (born 1966 in Thomassin, Haiti) is a Haitian who was assaulted, brutalized, and {{forcibly}} sodomized with a broken-off <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> {{by officers}} of the New York City Police Department after he was arrested outside a Brooklyn nightclub in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Ridley also improvised a vital {{piece of}} {{equipment}} at the last minute. Two days before taking the X-1 on its first supersonic flight, Chuck Yeager broke two ribs in a horseback riding accident. With the aid of an understanding civilian doctor, {{he was able to}} conceal his condition from everyone but Ridley. Without the full use of his right arm, however, {{it would be impossible to}} seal himself into the tiny X-1 cockpit. Ridley quietly provided a length of <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> that Yeager was able to use to close the hatch without difficulty.|$|E
25|$|In the German-speaking lands, {{groups of}} young people called Sternsinger (star singers) travel from door to door. They are dressed as the three Wise Men, plus the leader {{carrying}} a star, usually of painted wood attached to a <b>broom</b> <b>handle.</b> Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls {{for the benefit of}} singing their songs in four-part harmony, not necessarily three wise men at all. German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the Weisen (Magi) were men, or that there were three. The star singers will be offered treats at the homes they visit, but they also solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Evangelical-Lutheran churches. As a sign of gratitude, the young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk. In Roman Catholic communities this may be a serious spiritual event with the priest present even today, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit. Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches. Here all of the children who have gone out as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars. The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany.|$|E

50|$|Belote {{frequently}} mistreated Christian, and in mid- March 1912, {{an argument}} ensued {{between the two}} in which Belote accused Christian of stealing a locket and a skirt. Belote hit Christian with a cuspidor, commonly called a spittoon. The altercation escalated when Christian and Belote ran for two <b>broom</b> <b>handles</b> Belote used to prop up her bedroom windows. Christian grabbed one of the <b>broom</b> <b>handles</b> and struck Belote on the forehead. In an attempt to stifle Belote’s screams, Christian stuffed a towel down Belote’s throat, and the woman died by suffocation.|$|R
500|$|During {{a seventh}} {{interview}} the next day, Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had {{made during the}} attack. During the eighth interview, {{he said he had}} armed himself that night with a <b>broom</b> <b>handle,</b> and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock, but there were too many people around him: [...] "I had a weapon when I was running toward the policeman, a broom handle." [...] He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of common purpose.|$|E
500|$|By October {{the inmates}} were {{evacuated}} to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where inmates were suffering from severe overcrowding and {{a shortage of}} food. Wiesenthal's big toe on his right foot had to be amputated after a rock fell on it while he {{was working in the}} quarry. He was still ill in January when the advancing Soviets forced yet another evacuation, this time on foot, to Chemnitz. Using a <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> for a walking stick, {{he was one of the}} few who survived the march. From Chemnitz the prisoners were taken in open freight cars to Buchenwald, and a few days later by truck to Mauthausen concentration camp, arriving in mid-February 1945. Over half the prisoners did not survive the journey. Wiesenthal was placed in a death block for the mortally ill, where he survived on 200 calories a day until the camp was liberated by the Americans on 5 May 1945. Wiesenthal weighed [...] when he was liberated.|$|E
500|$|Psychiatric {{examinations}} {{and psychological}} tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature {{young man who}} was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of [...] "an obvious mental breakdown". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. [...] "I think this young man is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature," [...] he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as [...] "elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{was the first}} for {{director}} Samuel Bayer. Bayer stated he believed he was hired because his test-reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be [...] "punk" [...] and [...] "not corporate." [...] The video {{was based on the}} concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot. Inspiration was taken from Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film, Over the Edge, as well as the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. Filmed on a soundstage in Culver City, the video featured the band playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The music video features a brief appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene would cut to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push <b>broom</b> <b>handle.</b> The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. [...] "Once the kids came out dancing they just said ' you,' because they were so tired of this [...] throughout the day," [...] Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired. One of Cobain's major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that [...] "the video had something that was truly about what they were about." [...] The video had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.|$|E
2500|$|The 1963-64 {{series was}} played on {{exceedingly}} slow pitches, and all five Tests were drawn. In his report in Wisden, E.M. Wellings described the pitches as [...] "so slow and true that a competent craftsman could bat successfully with a <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> ... the matches were doomed {{to be drawn}} almost from the outset". Ian Wooldridge wrote that India [...] "included one fast bowler in her side more out of convention than for any tactical purpose". In the First Test that bowler was Vasant Ranjane, who took one wicket.|$|E
2500|$|Louima's {{teeth were}} also badly damaged {{in the attack}} by having the <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> jammed into his mouth. He testified to the {{presence}} of a second officer in the bathroom helping Volpe in the assault but could not positively identify him. The identity of the second attacker became a point of serious contention during the trial and appeals. Louima also initially claimed that the officers involved in the attack called him a racial slur and shouted, [...] "This is Giuliani-time" [...] during the beating. Louima later recanted that claim, and the reversal was used by defense lawyers to cast doubt on the entirety of his testimony.|$|E
50|$|Richard was {{constantly}} abused by his parents, especially by his father, who repeatedly beat him. His mother also beat him with <b>broom</b> <b>handles</b> (sometimes breaking the handle) and other household objects.

Kuklinski killed cats during his childhood.|$|R
5000|$|Hal Farrier, Dept. of Corrections {{director}} at the time, ordered assault teams into the prison without consulting Gov. Terry Branstad as time was of the essence. The squads converged on the cellblock from all directions. Some inmates gave minor resistance.

50|$|Fearing an {{outbreak}} of violence against the strike-breakers, the mining companies sought and received the support of police in readiness {{for the opening of}} the mines. A crowd estimated at 10 000 had organised to be witness to the arrival of the strike-breakers. This included the Women's Brigade who were 'armed with sticks, <b>broom</b> <b>handles</b> and axe handles, set upon any man who attempted to pass through the union picket lines'.|$|R
2500|$|Such was the {{difficulty}} in this task {{that the answer to}} many of the inherent challenges were along the lines of [...] "Yeager better have paid-up insurance." [...] Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse. He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond, who taped his ribs. Yeager told only his wife, as well as friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley, about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a <b>broom</b> <b>handle</b> as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 2016, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill {{said that}} no charges would be filed against {{officers}} Kory Checketts and Jordan Winegar. He said that the two officers believed that Mohamed was about to seriously injure or kill {{a man with a}} metal <b>broom</b> <b>handle.</b> While the shooting was recorded on the officers' body cameras, prosecutors declined to release the footage to the public until January 2017. Mohamed faces charges in juvenile court of aggravated robbery and possessing drugs with an intent to distribute after officers said they found methamphetamine in his pocket. [...] On January 23, 2017, a preliminary hearing was held in juvenile court. In June 2017, Mohamed was released from the juvenile court system with a $500 fee. As part of the plea bargain, he admitted to aggravated assault and drug possession.|$|E
2500|$|Casals {{was born}} in El Vendrell, Catalonia, Spain. His father, Carles Casals i Ribes (1852–1908), was a parish organist and choirmaster. He gave Casals {{instruction}} in piano, songwriting, violin, and organ. He was also a very strict disciplinarian. When Casals was young his father would pull the piano out {{from the wall and}} have him and his brother, Artur, stand behind it and name the notes and the scales that his father was playing. At the age of four Casals could play the violin, piano and flute; at the age of six he played the violin well enough to perform a solo in public. His first encounter with a cello-like instrument was from witnessing a local traveling Catalan musician, who played a cello-strung <b>broom</b> <b>handle.</b> Upon request, his father built him a crude cello, using a gourd as a sound-box. When Casals was eleven, he first heard the real cello performed by a group of traveling musicians, and decided to dedicate himself to the instrument.|$|E

50|$|In August 2003, it was {{reported}} that, while at a football training camp, at least {{three members of the}} football team were hazed by their teammates. Three members admitted to the acts, two of whom appeared in court. The hazing included anally penetrating the young men with foreign objects, including <b>broom</b> <b>handles,</b> pine cones, and golf balls. The team's season was canceled early, and two coaches were transferred to administrative positions. The incident briefly garnered national notice, including a protest from the members of Westboro Baptist Church in October 2003.|$|R
5000|$|On October 25, 2003, a 90-minute riot {{broke out}} over viewing the 2003 World Series, {{involving}} 150 prisoners nearing release fighting predominately along racial lines.

The privately employed guards retreated, while state correctional officers were called in from Ironwood and Chuckawalla state prisons in Blythe, 61 miles distant. [...] Two black inmates were stabbed to death, seven others were critically injured, and dozens more hurt. Eight inmates were ultimately charged with and convicted of murder.|$|R
2500|$|On February 16, 1978, Duty and Anthony Trombitas, {{whom he had}} met {{about four}} to five days earlier, robbed the Jiffy Mart {{convenience}} store on Falcon Road in Altus, {{north of the border}} with Texas. During the robbery, which netted some beer and money, ranging in various accounts from $7.66 to $18, the two men abducted store clerk Linda Hall (no relation). After driving her to a barn in Tillman County, Duty raped Hall and shot her {{in the back of the}} head three times with a [...]22 caliber pistol. Trombitas then hit her with a stick, which Duty identified as a <b>broom</b> <b>handle.</b> Though left for dead, Hall was able to walk a mile (1.6km) to a house for help and recovered at Tillman County Memorial Hospital. The two men drove off to Frederick, then Electra, and proceeded to Fort Worth. Upon hearing a radio report about her on the next day, Duty said, [...] "I was surprised that she was still alive." [...] Duty returned to Altus the following month, presuming that law enforcement officers were going to catch up with him anyway. He was arrested on the street after calling the police and hanging up from a payphone at another Jiffy Mart near the downtown square.|$|E
2500|$|Archibald Maclaren has {{attributed}} kobold behaviour to {{the virtue}} of the homeowners; a virtuous house has a productive and helpful kobold; a vice-filled one has a malicious and mischievous pest. If the hosts give up those things to which the kobold objects, the spirit ceases its annoying behaviour. Heinzelmann punished vices; for example, when the secretary of Hudenmühlen was sleeping with the chamber maid, the kobold interrupted a sexual encounter and hit the secretary with a <b>broom</b> <b>handle.</b> King Goldemar revealed the secret transgressions of clergymen, much to their chagrin. Joseph Snowe has related {{the tale of a}} kobold at Alte Burg: When two students slept in the mill in which the creature lived, one of them ate the offering of food the miller had left the kobold. The student who had left the meal alone felt the kobold's touch as [...] "gentle and soothing", but the one who had eaten its food felt that [...] "the fingers of the hand were pointed with poisoned arrowheads, or fanged with fire." [...] Even friendly kobolds are rarely completely good, and house kobolds may do mischief for no particular reason. They hide things, push people over when they bend to pick something up, and make noise at night to keep people awake. The kobold Hödekin of Hildesheim roamed the walls of the castle at night, forcing the watch to be constantly vigilant. A kobold in a fishermen's house in Köpenick on the Wendish Spree reportedly moved sleeping fishermen so that their heads and toes lined up. King Goldemar enjoyed strumming the harp and playing dice. One of Heinzelmann's pranks was to pinch drunken men to make them start fights with their companions. Heinzelmann liked his lord's two daughters and scared away their suitors so that the women never married.|$|E

50|$|Indoor {{fuzzball}} {{is usually}} played {{inside of a}} large net with no base runners. Outdoor fuzzball can be played either on paved school playgrounds (typically marked off for kickball) or on a baseball or softball field. Serious players will also use a cigarette lighter or a blowtorch to burn the felt off of the ball, thereby making it much faster when pitched. Bats may consist of <b>broom</b> <b>handles,</b> baseball bats, corkball bats, or official fuzzball bats, such as those made by Markwort Sporting Goods of St. Louis, Missouri. Markwort also makes an official fuzzball for use in games.|$|R

5000|$|Trixieland was a 7'x7'x7' box-room in the Littens' {{house in}} Shanklin, Isle of Wight. It {{was used for}} {{recording}} TBRM's first single and demos. It was also Mark's bedroom. Recording equipment consisted of a TEAC 1/4" [...] reel to reel tape recorder and an Aiwa tape to tape cassette recorder. There were no mixing facilities. The microphone stands were handmade from <b>broom</b> <b>handles.</b> Most tracks were created by first recording the drum machine, guitar and vocal together, then adding instruments one by one; bouncing between the two machines. The instruments were very inexpensive: a simple drum machine, a Westbury electric guitar, a non-Fender precision bass, and various percussion instruments. The sound resulting from this set-up was variable in quality, and should probably be described as lo-fi.|$|R

With the arrival of the Kennebec & Portland Railroad in 1851, Augusta became an even more productive mill town. In 1883, the property of A. & W.

In the late 19th century, a paper and pulp plant was constructed. Other Augusta firms produced lumber, sash, doors, window shutters, <b>broom</b> <b>handles,</b> stone cutters' tools, shoes, headstones, ice and furniture.
