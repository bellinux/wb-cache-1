During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to <b>backstep.</b> If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground is a {{survival}} horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a <b>backstep</b> maneuver, {{both of which}} reduce stamina. She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once.|$|E
500|$|The {{quest for}} 'purity' was {{retained}} in the zerg psyche, becoming a pseudo-religious concept to them. Through the quest for 'perfection' the zerg were set on a steady state of evolution and conflict. The core idea of this 'religion' {{was that there was}} a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form would never have to change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur accepts that the Overmind's instinctive desire for [...] "true perfection" [...] is impossible for the zerg swarm to achieve, yet reasoned that [...] "...chasing perfection was tactically sound regardless." [...] Instead, Abathur believed it is [...] "purpose" [...] which makes the zerg strong. Abathur states that without an overriding will, [...] "feral zerg" [...] are lesser than beasts, much like he was after the death of the Overmind. Abathur is personally responsible for the continuation of the zerg-species. He undertakes each experiment as though the survival of the species depends on it alone, and tolerates no genetic regression or evolutionary <b>backstep.</b> It is revealed in Heart of the Swarm that {{he was the one who}} designed the Queen of Blades.|$|E

Robustness of Adaptive <b>Backstepping</b> Control can be increased by designing a sliding surface to the associated Lyapunov function.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} the grey <b>backstepping</b> controller and adaptive <b>backstepping</b> controller for {{synchronous reluctance motor}} (SynRM) drive to track periodic position reference command trajectories. The <b>backstepping</b> controller can achieve good performance and reject any bounded of the external disturbance and parameter variations in SynRM drive system. In general, the conventional <b>backstepping</b> control design method is assumed that the upper boundary of parameter variations and external disturbances are known and the sign function is used. Therefore, it causes high frequency chattering and high gain phenomenon. In {{order to avoid the}} drawbacks, first, we use the grey <b>backstepping</b> control to reduce the high gain phenomenon. Furthermore, the adaptive <b>backstepping</b> control is used which has not high frequency chattering and high gain phenomenon drawbacks. Finally, we employ the experiments to validate the proposed method. Key Words, synchronous reluctance motor, grey <b>backstepping</b> control, adaptive <b>backstepping</b> control. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>backstepping</b> for a {{class of}} block strict-feedback {{nonlinear}} systems is considered. Since the input function could be zero for each <b>backstepping</b> step, the <b>backstepping</b> technique cannot be applied directly. Based {{on the assumption that}} nonlinear systems are polynomials, for each <b>backstepping</b> step, Lypunov function can be constructed in a polynomial form by sum of square (SOS) technique. The virtual control can be obtained by the Sontag feedback formula, which is equivalent to an optimal control-the solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Thus, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) could be used to estimate value functions (Lyapunov functions) instead of SOS. Through <b>backstepping</b> technique, the control Lyapunov function (CLF) of the full system is constructed finally making use of the strict-feedback structure and a stabilizable controller can be obtained through the constructed CLF. The contributions of the proposed method are twofold. On one hand, introducing ADP into <b>backstepping</b> can broaden the application of the <b>backstepping</b> technique. A class of block strict-feedback systems can be dealt by the proposed method and the requirement of nonzero input function for each <b>backstepping</b> step can be relaxed. On the other hand, <b>backstepping</b> with surface dynamic control actually reduces the computation complexity of ADP through constructing one part of the CLF by solving semidefinite programming using SOS. Simulation results verify contributions of the proposed method. Department of Computing 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcr...|$|R

Paradoxically, the effects of the future upon the new arrivals remain in place, creating a paradox that allows information to be sent to the past. For this reason, the on-duty chrononaut is typically confined to base as the absence of the chronosphere and/or its pilot is used as a means of determining a <b>Backstep</b> has taken place (and to prevent civilians from seeing Frank vanish into non-existence when replaced by his future self).
