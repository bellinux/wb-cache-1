50|$|Seal hunting, {{especially}} {{the more common}} harbor seal, was common everywhere farmers had access to seal breeding grounds. Seal was considered an important commodity. Whereas mutton was almost never eaten fresh, seal meat was usually eaten immediately, washed in seawater, or conserved {{for a short time}} in <b>brine.</b> <b>Seal</b> meat is not commonly eaten anymore and is rarely found in stores.|$|E

40|$|Lake Vida, {{located in}} Victoria Valley, {{is one of}} the largest lakes in the McMurdo dry valleys and is known to contain hypersaline liquid <b>brine</b> <b>sealed</b> below 16 m of {{freshwater}} ice. For the first time, Lake Vida was drilled to a depth of 27 m. Below 21 m the ice is marked by well-sorted sand layers up to 20 cm thick within a matrix of salty ice. From ice chemistry, isotopic composition of δ 18 O and δ 2 H, and ground penetrating radar profiles, we conclude that the entire 27 m of ice formed from surface runoff and the sediment layers represent the accumulation of surface deposits. Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating limit the maximum age of the lower ice to 6300 14 C yr BP. As the ice cover ablated downwards during periods of low surface inflow, progressive accumulation of sediment layers insulated and preserved the ice and brine beneath, analogous to the processes that preserve shallow ground ice. The repetition of these sediment layers reveals hydrologic variability in Victoria Valley during the mid- to late Holocene. Lake Vida is an exemplar site for understanding the preservation of subsurface brine, ice, and sediment in a cold desert environment...|$|R

Canned products are manufactured from cooked tuna fish, which is skinned, headed, eviscerated, trimmed of all blood meat, scorched and packed with a covering of oil or <b>brine</b> in hermetically <b>sealed</b> can and sterilized to achieve commercial sterility by application of heat.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} heavily hunted by sealers {{in the early}} 1800s. Seals were clubbed to death by men who raided seal colonies and rookeries by boat, {{sometimes}} swimming ashore armed with clubs and knives. The sealers typically bludgeoned the animals to death and used knives to skin the carcasses. Pups were often killed along with their mothers or sometimes kept as pets. The hides of the slain seals were then pickled in <b>brine</b> and exported. <b>Seal</b> hunting continued to occur in Gulf St. Vincent in the 1880s.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} discuss the {{relationship}} between dolomite reservoirs and diagenetic systems of the Changxing Formation, we studied carbon, oxygen and strontium stable isotopes, iron, manganese and strontium trace elements and the Mg/Ca (mol%) ratio, dolomite order degree, and determined that burial dolomitization {{is the key to}} controlling the distribution of high quality dolomite reservoir in the Changxing Formation in the eastern Sichuan Basin. The dolomite of the Changxing Formation is divided into four diagenetic systems: (1) penecontemporaneous stage syngenetic brine diagenetic system, (2) early diagenetic stage strata <b>seal</b> <b>brine</b> diagenetic system, (3) middle-late diagenetic stage mixed hot brine diagenetic system and (4) tectonic uplift stage mixed hydrothermal fluid diagenetic system. New understanding of the controlling factors and distribution of dolomite reservoir development is discussed. Reef shoal facies belts controlled regional reservoir distribution and the scale of development. Burial dolomitization of a strata <b>seal</b> <b>brine</b> diagenetic system is the foundation of reservoir development, mainly developing pore reservoir. Burial dolomitization of mixed hot brine diagenetic system expanded the reservoir distribution and improved the reservoir quality, mainly developing pore-vug reservoir. Fracturing and dissolution of a mixed hydrothermal fluid diagenetic system is the key to improving the reservoir quality, mainly developing pore-vug-crack complex reservoirs.|$|R

This testcase is based on experiments carried out in the rocksalt formation in the underground facility near Carlsbad, New Mexico, USA. Some of these experiments study the movement of brine in rocksalt under prevailing underground conditions {{and as a result of}} an increase in temperature. In brine inflow experiments, the inflow of brine in an open well is measured as a function of time. In pressure build-up experiments, wells with a radius of 10 cm are filled with <b>brine</b> and <b>sealed.</b> The pressure in the brine will than increase as a function of time due to the inflow of brine. This pressure is measured in compartments of the borehole which are sealed by packers. The computer code METROPOL- 2 has been used to simulate these experiments. Results of these calculations are compared with the measurements. From the results it can be concluded that the movement of brine in rock salt under the influence of pressure gradients can be described by Darcy's law. However, changes of hydrological parameters such as permeability and porosity of the rock salt due to deformation of the rock salt requires the coupling of a flow model with a rock mechanical model...|$|R
40|$|Saline {{aquifers}} of high permeability {{bounded by}} overlying/underlying seals may be surrounded laterally by low-permeability zones, possibly caused by natural heterogeneity and/or faulting. Carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) injection into and storage in such 'closed' systems with impervious seals, or 'semi-closed' systems with nonideal (low-permeability) seals, {{is different from}} that in 'open' systems, from which the displaced brine can easily escape laterally. In closed or semi-closed systems, the pressure buildup caused by continuous industrial-scale CO{sub 2 } injection may have a limiting effect on CO{sub 2 } storage capacity, because geomechanical damage caused by overpressure needs to be avoided. In this research, a simple analytical method was developed for the quick assessment of the CO{sub 2 } storage capacity in such closed and semi-closed systems. This quick-assessment method is {{based on the fact that}} native brine (of an equivalent volume) displaced by the cumulative injected CO{sub 2 } occupies additional pore volume within the storage formation and the seals, provided by pore and brine compressibility in response to pressure buildup. With nonideal <b>seals,</b> <b>brine</b> may also leak through the seals into overlying/underlying formations. The quick-assessment method calculates these brine displacement contributions in response to an estimated average pressure buildup in the storage reservoir. The CO{sub 2 } storage capacity and the transient domain-averaged pressure buildup estimated through the quick-assessment method were compared with the 'true' values obtained using detailed numerical simulations of CO{sub 2 } and brine transport in a two-dimensional radial system. The good agreement indicates that the proposed method can produce reasonable approximations for storage-formation-seal systems of various geometric and hydrogeological properties...|$|R
