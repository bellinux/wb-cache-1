40|$|The {{present study}} {{is based on an}} {{ecological}} analysis of transport and wellbeing as devised by Stokols and Novaco (1981). This study seeks to examine the link between transport mode and well-being. One hundred and eight Participants (N= 1 08) filled out a questionnaire that contained the psychological well-being scales of self-efficacy, general health and perceived stress; and the organizational scales of job satisfaction and absenteeism. The participants were divided into groups of 18 according to which transport mode they used. The transport mode groups were drive alone, train, <b>bus,</b> car <b>pool,</b> walk or cycle. It was hypothesized {{that there would be a}} significant difference in well-being between transport modes, that alternative modes of transport would score better than the drive alone category and that transport mode had an effect on psychological and organizational well-being. Findings supported that there was a difference in well-being between transport modes with the cycle and drive alone categories being significantly different to the <b>bus,</b> car <b>pool</b> and walk categories. Only the alternative mode of cycle performed better on the well-being scales than the drive alone category which did not support our second hypothesis. Transport mode did have an effect across both the psychological and organizational categories.

40|$|The thesis at hand {{examines}} {{knowledge transfer}} in cross-border strategic alliances of software companies. The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to provide theoretical foundations for a proposed cluster initiative (Asia Software Competence Project) and a software system innovation, ANIS (Alliance Network Information System). The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the strategic management context and the following three chapters the dimensions of epistemology, ontology and culture as relevant to this thesis. Epistemology is concerned about how knowledge is acquired and processed while the ontological dimension is here used to refer to the different levels of social interaction in an organizational setting (individual, team, organization and interorganizational levels). The third dimension, culture, is a significant source of ambiguity in knowledge transfer in cross-border context. The core contribution of the thesis is the conceptual development through describing the 4 -Tier Tube -model as the model of knowledge transfer and alliance learning in cross-border strategic alliance context. Key words: strategic alliances, knowledge transfer, absorptive capacity, transparency, trust, tacit knowledge, interorganizational knowledge creation, alliance learning, alliance innovation, complementary competences, 4 -Tier Tube, Innovation Tube, Knowledge <b>Bus,</b> Knowledge <b>Pool,</b> Skein of Alliance Learning, Alliance Learning Synchronicity (ALS...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic Climate Change of post {{industrial}} era {{is expected}} impact on {{all sectors of}} the society and needs strategic steps to reduce it. Mitigation efforts include global effort leading to curtailing the emission of green house gases. Adaptation measures {{on the other hand}} complement the mitigation measures by reducing the impact of global warming. Historically, mitigation has received more media attention due to its global canvas; while the adaptation measures have remained in the back ground. In this paper, authors have presented certain simple concepts which can be undertaken at the people's level to combat the impacts of Climate Change. In the field of mitigation, people can help reduce emission by reducing their consumption and demand for energy through use of: (i) Energy efficient gadgets. (ii) Eco friendly transport such as cycle for short distances and <b>bus</b> or car <b>pool</b> for longer distance travel. (iii) Local products of food and clothing, thus avoiding energy expended in transportation. (iv) Schools can encourage travel to and from by school buses rather than by individual transpor...|$|R

5000|$|POLITICO BY DEFAULT:While most MPs were roaring up {{and down}} the aisle of the Lok Sabha, hurling insults at each other debating the cash-for-vote scam, one man grimaced {{watching}} the tamasha sitting in his North Avenue flat, Says Ravi Prakash Verma, whose family has sent MPs for 10 out of 14 Lok Sabhas: “When Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s NDA turned turtle, defeated by one vote, I had been offered Rs. 10 crore for my vote. People do not know I have rudely sent back the man who had come with the money.Becoming an MP has become a habit with the members of the late Bal Govind Verma, Ravi’s father. He (Ravi’s father) himself had been MP four times, his wife (Ravi’s mother) thrice and Ravi Prakash Verma himself is in his third consecutive term. But though his father had been a minister, Ravi Prakash Verma never went to school in a red beacon vehicle. He used to walk to and back from school.His school uniforms were never bought, rather, his once-MP mother used to stitch them for little Ravi. During his college days at Allahabad University, he like any other normal student stayed in a rented house and cooked his own meals. And even now, there hasn’t been much change in his lifestyle. Unlike politicos who appoint PAs the second day after being sworn in as MPs, Ravi has none. It is possible that if you are ring the bell at his door, his wife would open it, not some liveried servant. Most often he travels to the Parliament in the <b>pool</b> <b>bus</b> meant for members. He remains what his father was, a firm believer of socialist ideals of Acharya Narendra Dev. “I have bought no property during my tenure as MP”, he categorically told TSI (The Sunday Indian).”Yes, I have property, but that is ancestral. For a living I farm my land. Indeed, he does not think of himself as a politician, but rather an intellectual. In fact, he came into politics to stop his mother from being duped by unscrupulous people.|$|R
