We show that empirically relevant specific provisioning regimes induce financial accelerator mechanisms and result in financial, price and macroeconomic instability. Dynamic provisioning systems, set to cover for expected losses over the whole business cycle, significantly reduce welfare losses, and in addition moderate the (otherwise optimal) anti-inflationary stance in the monetary policy rule. The optimal policy response to financial shocks calls for a combination of macroprudential dynamic provisions and standard Taylor rules, which exclude targeting financial indicators.

In September that year, following the announcement the carrier expected an A$250million(million) net loss for the half-year period that ended on 31 December and the implementation of cost-cutting measures that would see the cut of 1,000 jobs within a year, S downgraded Qantas credit from BBB- (the lowest investment grade) to BB+, which may imply a rise in <b>borrowing</b> <b>costs</b> and a limitation in the investment potential.

500|$|With the {{financial}} crisis abated, many in Congress wanted the greenbacks to be withdrawn from circulation. The public had never seen greenbacks as equivalent to specie, and by 1866 they circulated at a considerable discount, although their value had risen {{since the end of}} the war. Hugh McCulloch, the Treasury Secretary under Lincoln and Johnson, believed the notes were an emergency measure only and thought they should be gradually withdrawn. McCulloch proposed a bill, the Contraction Act, to convert some of the greenbacks from notes redeemable in bonds to interest-bearing notes redeemable in coin. Most Senate Finance Committee members had no objection, and Sherman found himself alone in opposition to it, believing that withdrawing greenbacks from circulation would contract the money supply and harm the economy. Sherman instead favored leaving the existing notes in circulation and letting the growth in population catch up to the growth in money supply. He suggested an amendment that would instead just allow the Treasury to redeem the notes for lower-interest bonds, now that the government's <b>borrowing</b> <b>costs</b> had decreased. Sherman's amendment was voted down, and the Contraction Act passed; greenbacks would be gradually withdrawn, but those still circulating would be redeemable for the high-interest bonds as before. In his memoirs, Sherman called this law [...] "the most injurious and expensive financial measure ever enacted by Congress," [...] as the continued high-interest payments it required [...] "added fully $300,000,000 of interest" [...] to the national debt.|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} Congress, {{among the first}} bills to pass the house was the Public Credit Act of 1869, which would require the {{government}} to pay bondholders in gold, not greenbacks. The 1868 election campaign had seen the Democrats proposing to repay the bondholders (mostly supporters of the Union war effort) in paper; Republicans favored gold, as the bonds had been purchased with gold. Sherman agreed with his fellow Republicans and voted with them to pass the bill 42-13. Sherman continued to favor wider circulation of the greenback when he voted for the Currency Act of 1870, which authorized an additional $54 million in United States Notes. Sherman was also involved in debate over the Funding Act of 1870. The Funding Act, which Sherman called [...] "he most important financial measure of that Congress," [...] refunded the national debt. The bill as Sherman wrote it authorized $1.2 billion of low-interest rate bonds {{to be used to}} purchase the high-rate bonds issued during the war, {{to take advantage of the}} lower <b>borrowing</b> <b>costs</b> brought about by the peace and security that followed the Union victory. The Act was the subject of considerable debate over the exact rates and amounts, but once the differences were ironed out, it passed by large majorities in both houses. While Sherman was unhappy with the compromises (especially the extension of the bonds' term to 30 years, which he believed too long), he saw the bill as an improvement over the existing conditions and urged its passage.|$|E

40|$|The inflation-indexed bonds the U. S. Treasury {{plans to}} issue {{will reduce the}} {{expected}} <b>borrowing</b> <b>cost</b> if the yield curve reflects a risk premium for inflation. In the United Kingdom, indexed bonds are also used to extract inflationary expectations and thus to guide monetary policy. The bonds will produce a more reliable measure of such expectations if the inflation risk premium is taken into account. We estimate such a risk premium for the United States {{by means of a}} two-factor affine-yield model of the term structure. The model allows both the inflation risk premium and real term premium to vary over time. Using monthly data on CPI inflation and on bond yields for two-year to ten-year maturities, we find both premia to have been significant for the sample period January 1984 to July 1996. We estimate that indexed bonds would have saved an average of one-fifth of the expected <b>borrowing</b> <b>cost</b> of 10 -year notes.
