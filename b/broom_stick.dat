5|$|Players {{navigate}} the witch protagonist through the 2D game world from a side-view perspective. Cauldron {{is divided into}} two modes of play: shooting while flying and jumping along platforms. Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a <b>broom</b> <b>stick,</b> while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, the witch encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled. Players are given limited opportunities for this to occur, and the game ends once the number of lives reaches zero.|$|E
25|$|A feather duster is an {{implement}} used for cleaning. It consists typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire. In 1870, {{the original idea}} for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in Jones County, Iowa. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking {{if they could be}} used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a short <b>broom</b> <b>stick</b> and splitting the feathers with a pocket knife, the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of Iowa.|$|E

From the bright red wagon proceeded a certain metallic rumbling and clinking as it bowled along, and two or three nests of tin pans on its flat rope-encircled top flashed back the light so dazzlingly that Jedediah seemed the beaming sun of a little planetary system all his own.
