500|$|Fauré's operas {{have not}} found {{a place in the}} regular repertoire. Prométhée is the more {{neglected}} of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered Pénélope (1913) a fascinating work, {{and one of the best}} operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, [...] "distinctly non-theatrical." [...] The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Fauré's late style, [...] "tonality is stretched hard, without breaking." [...] On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, [...] "A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre.... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective." [...] However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, [...] "Fauré's Pénélope is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer's theatrical touch was." ...|$|E

[...] Because they lack a diaphragm, lizards and salamanders must expand and contract their body wall in order to force air {{in and out of}} their lungs, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same muscles used to laterally undulate the body during locomotion. [...] Thus, they cannot move and breathe at the same time, a situation called Carrier's constraint, though some, such as monitor lizards, can circumvent this restriction via buccal pumping. [...] In contrast, the spinal flexion of a galloping mammal causes the abdominal viscera to act as a piston, inflating and deflating the lungs as the animal's spine flexes and extends, increasing ventilation and allowing greater oxygen exchange.|$|E
