5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (<b>bias)</b> <b>in</b> the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{parenting}} as one potential route through which information processing biases for threat develop in children.

5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun <b>bias</b> <b>in</b> English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Biases</b> <b>in</b> {{emotional}} {{processing and}} cognitions about the self {{are thought to}} play a role in the maintenance of eating disorders (EDs). However, little is known about whether these difficulties exist pre-morbidly and how they might contribute to risk. METHOD: Female dieters (n= 82) completed a battery of tasks designed to assess the processing of social cues (facial emotion recognition), cognitions about the self [Self-Schema Processing Task (SSPT) ] and ED-specific cognitions about eating, weight and shape (emotional Stroop). The 26 -item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT- 26; Garner et al. 1982) was used to assess subclinical ED symptoms; this was used as an index of vulnerability within this at-risk group. RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that <b>biases</b> <b>in</b> the processing of both neutral and angry faces were predictive of our measure of vulnerability (EAT- 26). In the self-schema task, <b>biases</b> <b>in</b> the processing of negative self descriptors previously found to be common in EDs predicted vulnerability. <b>Biases</b> <b>in</b> the processing of shape-related words on the Stroop task were also predictive; however, these biases were more important in dieters who also displayed <b>biases</b> <b>in</b> the self-schema task. We were also able to demonstrate that these biases are specific and separable from more general negative biases that could be attributed to depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that specific <b>biases</b> <b>in</b> the processing of social cues, cognitions about the self, and also about eating, weight and shape information, may be important in understanding risk and preventing relapse in EDs...|$|R
