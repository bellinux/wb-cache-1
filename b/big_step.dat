5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a <b>big</b> <b>step,</b> given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E

25|$|After 1938 high {{performance}} aircraft engines were equipped with floatless pressure carburetors, especially those engines used in combat aircraft. These carburetors were a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> forward in technology, {{and could be}} looked upon as mechanical counterparts of today's electronic fuel control computers. These floatless pressure carburetors are the topic of this article.|$|E
25|$|The Council {{had other}} plans. In 1919 it offered Burfords £12,000 as an {{incentive}} {{to move out of}} the city altogether.

25|$|The new {{ownership}} of 1520 Sedgwick {{is seen by}} public officials and housing advocates as a huge victory {{in the struggle to}} preserve affordable housing in New York City. It is a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> forward in the fight to rescue low income housing from the disastrous impact overleveraging has had on this vulnerable resource. The rescue of 1520 Sedgwick was largely made possible through a sustained organizing campaign within the tenant body. Residents of this iconic building fought for over 5 years to maintain the affordability of their home and rescue it from speculative landlords.|$|E

Initially the English had sponsored classical education in India, based on Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, but as new ideas came from England, it was felt essential to introduce Indians to western education, particularly the sciences. There were strong protagonists on both sides. Indeed, the setting up of Hindu College in 1817 was a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> forward in the direction of western education.|$|E

But when her overbearing police chief father (Martin Lawrence) insists on escorting her instead in hopes to sway her decision, soon finds her dream trip {{has turned into a}} nightmare adventure full of comical misfortune and turmoil. In its opening weekend, the film grossed approximately $14,000,000 in 2,706 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking as the No. 2 film at box office.

25|$|On September 30, 1995 Damascus opened {{contacts}} with high ranking German CDU MP Heinrich Lummer and intelligence officials in Damascus. The CDU demanded PKK end all its activities in Germany. The PKK demanded {{that it should}} be recognized as a legitimate entity and not as a terrorist organization. The PKK had been banned in Germany in 1993. If the PKK's demand had passed, it would be a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> for Damascus, not just for the water issues and Hatay demands, but also because a Western country was negotiating with a banned organization. It would be a big blow to Turkey as the inability to stop terrorism in the country could end with balkanization of the region.|$|E
25|$|The new Fronte was a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> {{away from}} the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|The new {{calendar}} {{received little}} {{support from the}} Indian Zoroastrian community, since it was considered to contradict the injunctions expressed in the Denkard. In Iran, however, the Fasli calendar gained momentum following a campaign in 1930 to persuade the Iranian Zoroastrians to adopt it, under {{the title of the}} Bastani (traditional) calendar. In AD 1925, the Iranian Parliament had introduced a new Iranian calendar, which (independent of the Fasli movement) incorporated both points proposed by the Fasili Society, and since the Iranian national calendar had also retained the Zoroastrian names of the months, it was not a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> to integrate the two. The Bastani calendar was duly accepted by many of the Zoroastrians. Many orthodox Iranian Zoroastrians, especially the Sharifabadis of Yazd, continued to use the Qadimi, however.|$|E

25|$|Government {{repression}} of political dissent has dropped sharply since the mid-1990s. The previous decades are sometimes {{described as the}} Years of Lead (Les Années de Plomb), and included forced disappearances, killings of government opponents and secret internment camps such as Tazmamart. To examine the abuses committed {{during the reign of}} King Hassan II (1961–1999), the government has set up an Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER), which is to rehabilitate the victims, and pay compensation for state outrages against them. This has been hailed internationally as a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> forward, and an example to the Arab world. However, the IER has also come under attack from parts of the human rights-community, since its mission was not to reveal the identities of or prosecute human rights offenders, which most of the victims were requesting.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the group started to grow when Salah met his very close friend Samer George at the French Cultural Centre where Samer was {{performing}} some Beatles songs.

However, the group hasn't even started yet although there were plans to 'do something' in the future. Returning from Bahrain, everyone went to their different musical projects and the trio was separated to be reunited again in 2000.|$|E

APOEL got their Europa League group stage campaign off to a winning start after coming from behind to beat FC Astana 2–1 at GSP Stadium. On matchday 2, APOEL earned their first ever continental group stage away win with a shock 0–1 victory over Olympiacos in Piraeus. On matchday 3, two second-half penalties condemned APOEL to their first defeat of their Europa League campaign, as they went down 3–1 away to Young Boys. On matchday 4, APOEL achieved an important 1–0 victory over Young Boys at GSP Stadium and made a <b>big</b> <b>step</b> towards their qualification to the knockout phase of the competition. On matchday 5, APOEL made history after becoming the first Cypriot club to reach the knockout phase of the UEFA Europa League, despite losing 2–1 away to FC Astana. On matchday 6, APOEL secured top spot in Group B of the Europa League after an impressive 2–0 win over Olympiacos at the GSP stadium, and set a new club (and national) record by accruing 12 points in this season's group stage.|$|E
