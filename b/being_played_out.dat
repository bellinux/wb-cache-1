5|$|In May 2016, Pogba {{was named}} by {{national}} side manager Didier Deschamps to France's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, {{to be played}} on home soil. Although much was expected of Pogba at the upcoming European Championships, in France's opening match of the tournament, a 2–1 win over Romania on 10 June, he endured criticism for his perceived negative performance after <b>being</b> <b>played</b> <b>out</b> of position, and was subsequently left on the bench by Deschamps for his nation's second group match, later coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 win over Albania. In the round of the 16, he was once again the target of media scrutiny for conceding an early penalty against Ireland, prompting former England international Gary Lineker to tweet: “Is Pogba the world’s most overrated player?”; France eventually came from behind to win the match 2–1.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September, Carrick scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} 2009–10 season with the decisive goal against German champions Wolfsburg in a 2–1 Champions League win at home. Two months later, he scored his first league goal of the season, scoring the second of a 3–0 home win over Everton. Due to a {{defensive}} crisis during December, Carrick had to fill in at centre-back since Gary Neville, himself <b>being</b> <b>played</b> <b>out</b> of position, picked up an injury against West Ham United in a 4–0 away win. Carrick had never previously played in defence during his career but manager Sir Alex Ferguson was very pleased with his contribution. On 8 December, he played in defence again by playing in a three-man defence alongside central-midfielder Darren Fletcher and regular left-back Patrice Evra in a 3–1 away win against Wolfsburg in the Champions League. His third goal of the season came on 30 December in a 5–0 home league win over Wigan Athletic in what was United's last game of the decade.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the theatrics of the musicians in the band, there was generally an additional performance piece <b>being</b> simultaneously <b>played</b> <b>out</b> in complement to the song, usually with an S&M and/or B&D theme. This included pouring melting candle wax on female performers, spanking or paddling female performers, dominatrix humiliation and beatings of male performers and audience volunteers, the burning of an American flag draped on a cross, a fire breathing male stilt walker and fire breather, and female performers wearing strap-on dildos and otherwise wielding dildos by hand. Common motifs included variations on nun and priest costumes, school girl uniforms, and a costume reminiscent of Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.|$|R

25|$|For {{the first}} All-Ireland {{championship}} in 1887, {{the competition was}} played on an open draw knockout basis. From 1888, the provincial system was introduced, whereby the counties in each of Ireland's four provinces would play each other on a knockout basis to find provincial champions. These four champions would meet in the All-Ireland semi-finals. The structure outlined above was adopted in 2001 to allow more games to be played, but still retain provincial championships and the knockout structure, resulting in every game continuing to be a meaningful fixture, with no dead-rubber league format matches <b>being</b> <b>played</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

50|$|Soon after Linus's arrival, other kidnap victims start {{being brought}} down via a lift- the lift being {{the means by}} which the {{kidnapper}} communicates. The first to arrive is nine-year-old Jenny, who forms a close bond with Linus. Jenny successfully convinces the kidnapper to send down food by presenting a polite, handwritten note to 'Him' via a message in the elevator. Soon after, other kidnap victims arrive, but have nothing in common with one another. Anja is a beautiful, smartly-dressed but somewhat selfish woman in her twenties, Bird is an older businessman who gets on well with Anja. There's also Fred- an addict, and Russell- an elderly man with a brain tumor. The group quickly learn that any attempt at escape results in 'punishments' from the kidnapper- such as deafening noise <b>being</b> <b>played,</b> <b>being</b> knocked <b>out</b> with gas and food deliveries stopping or being poisoned. At one point, the kidnapper sends down vodka and drugs- presumably to stop the group from trying to work together effectively. Linus tries to convince everyone to continue co-operating, but his efforts are merely met with hostility and complaints from some of the group.|$|R

As a result, Van der Vaart took Ibrahimović's spot as striker.

Compulsory uniformed (usually military) service was {{implemented}} in 1967: all 18-year-old males were required to train full-time for two or two-and-a-half years, according to their level of education. Homosexuality and transsexuality were listed as conditions in a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) 'Directory of Diseases' (disease code 302). Prior to enlistment, all enlistees underwent a medical examination, during which {{they were asked to}} declare their homosexuality and/or transgender status (medics conducting the examination had little awareness of the difference between the two). New recruits who came out were deployed to non-combat, non-sensitive vocations. They were generally downgraded to a Public Employment Status of 3 (PES3) and assigned only light clerical work.|$|E

40|$|Standardized {{test scores}} {{continue}} {{to the ultimate}} measure of school success. With $ 14 billion in annual federal funds directed towards low SES or Title I schools, the stakes are high. Policy-makers are dangling grants, takeover, closure, {{and everything in between}} for schools, all based on test scores. For non-Title I schools, a different story is <b>being</b> <b>plays</b> <b>out.</b> Student demographics - the greatest predictor of academic achievement - plays in their favor. Judged by the test scores from all socioeconomic areas, non-Title I high schools appear to be consistently successful. On the surface, {{there appears to be no}} impetus to improve student learning. Yet, disaggregation of achievement data found minimal improvement in academic achievement during the last 12 years in non-Title I high schools. Furthermore, the relationship between student demographics and academic achievement leaves no quick fixes for non-Title I high schools. This study was designed to examine the nature of potential relationships between a set of academic variables - rigor, connectedness, and climate - and academic achievement in non-Title I high schools. Data that represents these three academic variables were selected from an analysis of past literature. A factor analysis was utilized to establish valid and representative scores for academic rigor, school connectedness, and school climate. A regression analysis was then run between the independent variables and API score, while controlling for a set of student demographics, to determine what significant influence each variable had on student achievement. This study recommends seven resiliency skill development strategies for non-Title I high schools to improve academic achievement. Resiliency theory has been well-documented in schools and students that overcame social and economic challenges. This study suggests that even in high schools with fewer economic and demographic challenges, resiliency and connectedness was still important, and might be one of the few factors educators in these schools can influence to improve student achievement...|$|R

It show how political clientelism {{works in a}} macro-comparative perspective using the contrasting cases of Southern Italy and California as examples of two ideal-types in which clientelistic politics operates. The main finding is that the allocation and flow of financial funds related to public and infrastructural spending is influenced by clientelistic political strategies. This means that variations in the territorial distribution of public and infrastructural spending structure and govern electoral outcomes - e. g. exchange of votes in return for allocation of resources (favors). Decreasing expenditures in Southern Italy lead to increase in preference voting, whereas increasing availability {{of state and federal}} resources increase incumbent advantage and push for increasing role of lobbying and special-interests politics in the state of California.

The events of the story are <b>being</b> <b>played</b> <b>out</b> by a little boy named Finn on his father's {{expansive}} Lego set in their basement. His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes {{home from work and}} chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and has the power to change everything. Finn reconciles with his father, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and begins a relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.|$|E
