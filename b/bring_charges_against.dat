5|$|Estimates of {{the amount}} of money Cox fraudulently {{obtained}} rangefrom $5 million, to more than $15 million, to more than $25 million. He is believed to have fraudulently mortgaged more than 100 properties. Cox is serving a 26-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), a low-security facility in Coleman, Florida. He was ordered to pay $5.97 million in restitution, and testify against his co-conspirators. As of 2010, the United States Attorney's office has not brought charges against any of his 13 Tampa-area cohorts, even though Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert A. Mosakowski informed a judge in 2005 that he planned to <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> up to 13 accomplices.|$|E
5|$|The {{king had}} become {{incapacitated}} in August 1453, which {{had led to}} the Duke of York being appointed protector and controlling the government. By Christmas of 1454, however, King Henry had recovered from his illness, which removed the basis for York's authority. Having reconvened the court at Westminster by mid-April 1455, Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at Leicester. York and the Nevilles anticipated that Somerset would <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> them at this assembly. John Neville included, they gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at St Albans.|$|E
5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

These charges were delayed, as courts held that Paul could not <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the Clintons as he fought extradition from Brazil (to which he had fled in 2001 to escape Stan-Lee-Media-related criminal charges, see below), but proceeded once he was returned to the States.|$|E
25|$|Albert, however, {{was under}} {{investigation}} by the Secret Service because of his propaganda activities. On July 24, 1915, he accidentally left his briefcase on a train; it was recovered by a Secret Service agent who had been following him. The briefcase contained details about the phenol plot and other covert activities to indirectly aid the German war effort. Although it was not incriminating enough to <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Albert or the other conspirators (since the United States was still officially neutral and trade with Germany was legal), the documents were soon leaked to the New York World, an anti-German newspaper. The World published an exposé on August 15, 1915, and the publicity soon forced Albert to stop funding the phenol purchases.|$|E

He clarified that the investigation was ongoing and stated that such pre-release leaks are damaging for the members who invest budgets in marketing and promotion before release. The Sun reported that SyCo's personal computers were also hacked the previous month and unfinished tracks by singer Alexandra Burke were also leaked. SyCo also expressed their opinion, stating that they believe the song was leaked by hackers and not by someone in the music industry.

500|$|However, {{the court}} found that the Church enjoyed the {{protection}} of the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment, and that it could use the [...] "ministerial exemptions" [...] in employment law to deflect litigation over its treatment of its members. The judge ruled that the First Amendment disallowed the courts from [...] "examining church operations rooted in religious scripture". Bringing the Church to account for how it disciplined its members was [...] "precisely the type of entanglement that the religion clauses prohibit." [...] However, the 9th Circuit did suggest that other types of claims would withstand appellate review, such as assault, battery or [...] "any of a number of other theories that might have better fit the evidence." [...] The ruling has effectively meant {{that it is impossible to}} <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the Church based on claims of 'trafficking in persons.' As one attorney has put it, [...] "Here is a court saying, albeit in a civil situation... that there is nothing improper with this type of conduct and no ill motive can be imbued to the church." [...] Former US federal prosecutor Michael Seigel says that the ruling [...] "doesn't seem to leave much room for hope of success on a criminal prosecution".

500|$|In July 1945, FBI {{director}} J.

Belknap (1994), p 210. [...] Powers, p 214. As the Cold War continued to intensify in 1947, Congress held a hearing at which the Hollywood Ten refused to testify about alleged involvement with the CPUSA, leading to their convictions for contempt of Congress in early 1948. The same year, Hoover instructed the Department of Justice to <b>bring</b> <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the CPUSA leaders with the intention of rendering the Party ineffective. Redish, pp 81–82. John McGohey, a federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, was given the lead role in prosecuting the case and charged twelve leaders of the CPUSA with violations of the Smith Act. The specific charges against the defendants were first, that they conspired to overthrow the US government by violent means, and second, that they belonged to an organization that advocated the violent overthrow of the government. The indictment, issued on June29, 1948, asserted that the CPUSA had been in violation of the Smith Act since July1945. [...] The twelve defendants, arrested in late July 1948, were all members of the National Board of the CPUSA: Belknap (1994), p 207. [...] Lannon, p 122. [...] Morgan, p 314. [...] Powers, p 215.|$|E
