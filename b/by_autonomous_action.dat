5000|$|Capitalism {{is based}} on the {{exploitation}} of the working class by the ruling class. But inequality and exploitation are also expressed in terms of race, gender, sexuality, health, ability and age, and in these ways one section of the working class oppresses another. This divides us, causing a lack of class unity in struggle that benefits the ruling class. Oppressed groups are strengthened <b>by</b> <b>autonomous</b> <b>action</b> which challenges social and economic power relationships. To achieve our goal we must relinquish power over each other on a personal as well as a political level.|$|E
40|$|An {{arrangement}} of cooling channels in a mold {{should be designed}} properly to improve productivity and formability for a molded product in injection molding, because temperature distribution on the mold {{is dependent on the}} arrangement and has some influence on molded defects. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a methodology for automatically designing {{arrangement of}} cooling channels so as to obtain the suitable temperature distribution to reduce molded defects and to realize high productivity. A cooling channel is modeled by a set of autonomous elements which is arranged as a line and has performance for extracting heat in the mold. The arrangement of cooling channels are automatically obtained <b>by</b> <b>autonomous</b> <b>action</b> of these elements, according to information sent from sources which are located on the mold cavity surface and evaluate temperature on its location. For estimating the temperature distribution, a steady-state heat conduction is assumed for heattransfer in the mold and calculated by numerical analysis. Several numerical experiments have been conducted for estimating the proposed method, and the effectiveness and feasibility have beeit confirmed for automatic design of cooling channels...|$|E
40|$|In {{the debate}} over the role of civil society under authoritarian regimes, the spread of transna-tional web-based media obliges us to rethink the arenas in which the {{societal}} voice can be raised—and heard. Taking the case of state-socialist Cuba, a diachronic comparison analyzes civil society dynamics prior to the Internet—in the early to mid- 1990 s, and a decade later, after digital and web-based media made their way onto the island. The study finds that in the pre-Internet period, the focus was on behind-the-scenes struggles for associational autonomy within the state-socialist framework. A decade later, web-based communication technologies have supported {{the emergence of a new}} type of public sphere in which the civil society debate is marked <b>by</b> <b>autonomous</b> citizen <b>action.</b> While this defies the socialist regime’s design of state–society relations, its effect on democratization depends on the extent to which a web-based voice connects with off-line public debate and social action. ...|$|R
40|$|Replication {{strategies}} rely on {{the exploration}} of new knowledge. An important source of new knowledge is the transfer of unit level experience to HQ, a process referred to as reverse knowledge flows. Such knowledge flows are fraught with difficulty as formal mechanisms often break down due to diverging business interests of unit and HQ managers. This study brings together research on knowledge stickiness and <b>autonomous</b> <b>action</b> to provide {{a new avenue for}} understanding RKF after formal mechanisms break down. By drawing on an exploratory study of a franchise network, we provide an insight into how <b>autonomous</b> <b>action</b> reduces initiation stickiness, but potentially increases implementation stickiness. Our analysis suggests that the role of <b>autonomous</b> <b>action</b> for reverse knowledge flows is moderated by unit managers’ resource expectations that emerge as a result of <b>autonomous</b> <b>action.</b> Exploring the interplay of <b>autonomous</b> <b>action</b> and knowledge stickiness provides new explanatory means for understanding reverse knowledge flows in replicator organizations...|$|R

40|$|In {{striking}} {{contrast to}} the legislatures in most modern democracies, Congress retains an important place in American politics and policy making. Especially in recent years, this has led many observers to question {{the importance of the}} presidency and bureaucracy to the real work of American governance {{and the extent to which}} political actors in the executive branch generally exercise power. This narrative of congressional dominance has been particularly bolstered by recent scholarly interest in principal-agent models of interbranch relations. The assumption of congressional centrality, however, obscures many important features of American politics. Over the course of American history, institutional development in particular has often been driven <b>by</b> either <b>autonomous</b> executive <b>action</b> or conflicts between Congress and the executive. We develop an approach for assessing executive power in institutional politics and illustrate the logic of executive influence with three cases: the rise of federal food-and-drug and forestry regulation, and the growth of the federal farm extension service in the early twentieth century; the rise of the national security state in the mid-twentieth century; and the evolution of budgeting and spending practices over the course of the twentieth century.
