25|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} transformation efficiency, transformed cells are grown in super optimal <b>broth</b> <b>to</b> expedite the recovery process after transformation. In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both Cas9 and sgRNA were expressed {{at the same time}} without the linear DNA to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption of the crucial gene. Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and sgRNA were kept under strict control and transformed stepwise to reduce cell lethality.|$|E
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the <b>broth</b> <b>to</b> make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very {{much a matter of}} the region and the cook's taste.|$|E
25|$|Buckwheat groats are {{commonly}} used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted groats that are cooked with <b>broth</b> <b>to</b> a texture similar to rice or bulgur. The dish was brought to America by Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish immigrants who called it kasha, and they mixed it with pasta or {{used it as a}} filling for cabbage rolls, knishes, and blintzes, hence buckwheat prepared in this fashion is most commonly called kasha in America. Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, eaten primarily in Estonia, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, called grechka in Ukrainian or Russian. The groats can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{epidemiology}} {{over time}} of non-O 157 Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is unknown.

Beginning in 2000, Connecticut laboratories were required <b>to</b> submit ST-positive <b>broths</b> <b>to</b> the State Laboratory for isolation and typing of STEC.

60|$|Rollo {{immediately}} {{conceived the}} idea of performing for this lady the kind service which Maria had so successfully performed for him. So, without speaking to her at all, he went immediately down into the cabin again, and thence followed the long passages {{which led to the}} dining saloon, until he came to the door of it.

40|$|SummaryThe {{gene cluster}} {{responsible}} for pimaricin biosynthesis in Streptomyces natalensis contains a cholesterol oxidase-encoding gene (pimE) surrounded by genes involved in pimaricin production. Gene-inactivation and -complementation experiments revealed that pimE encodes a functional cholesterol oxidase and, surprisingly, {{that it is}} also involved in pimaricin biosynthesis. This extracellular enzyme was purified from S. natalensis culture <b>broths</b> <b>to</b> homogeneity, and it was shown to restore pimaricin production when added to the mutant culture broths. Other cholesterol oxidases also triggered pimaricin production, suggesting that these enzymes could act as signaling proteins for polyene biosynthesis. This finding constitutes the description of a cholesterol oxidase gene with an involvement in antibiotic biosynthesis, and it broadens {{the scope of the}} biological functions for this type of oxidase...|$|R
30|$|A fine {{touch of}} B. licheniformis SHG 10 {{preserved}} on PA slant was streaked on PA agar and was incubated at 37 °C for overnight.

60|$|In {{the course}} of the {{afternoon}} Lily found that one portion had not been given out. It was that which was intended for the Martins, a poor old rheumatic couple, who lived at South End, the most distant part of the parish. Neither of them could walk as far as the New Court, and most of their neighbours had followed Farmer Gage, and had therefore been excluded from the distribution, so that {{there was no one to}} send. Lily, therefore, resolved herself to carry the <b>broth</b> <b>to</b> them, if she could find an escort, which was not an easy matter, as the frost had that morning broken up, and a good deal of snow and rain had been falling in {{the course of}} the day. In the hall she met Reginald, just turned out of Maurice's workshop, and much at a loss for employment.|$|E
60|$|After sipping maté and rum {{for half}} an hour we settled down to discuss a {{plentiful}} supper of roast and boiled beef and mutton, with great basins of well-seasoned <b>broth</b> <b>to</b> wash it down. I consumed an amazing quantity of meat, as much, in fact, as any gaucho there; and to eat as much as one of these men at a sitting is a feat for an Englishman to boast about. Supper done, I lit a cigar and leant back against the wall, enjoying many delightful sensations all together--warmth, rest, and hunger satisfied, and the subtle fragrance of that friend and comforter, divine tobacco. On the farther side of the room my host was meanwhile talking to the other men in low tones. Occasional glances in my direction seemed to show that they still harboured some suspicion of me, or that they had some grave matters to converse about unsuitable for a stranger to hear.|$|E
60|$|In they tramped, {{making a}} {{tremendous}} clatter upon the stone-floor with the iron-shod heels of their large jack-boots, and the clash and clang of their long, heavy, basket-hilted broadswords. Milnwood and his housekeeper trembled, from well-grounded apprehensions {{of the system}} of exaction and plunder carried on during these domiciliary visits. Henry Morton was discomposed with more special cause, for he remembered that he stood answerable to the laws for having harboured Burley. The widow Mause Headrigg, between fear for her son's life and an overstrained and enthusiastic zeal, which reproached her for consenting even tacitly to belie her religious sentiments, was in a strange quandary. The other servants quaked for they knew not well what. Cuddie alone, with the look of supreme indifference and stupidity which a Scottish peasant can at times assume as a mask for considerable shrewdness and craft, continued to swallow large spoonfuls of his <b>broth,</b> <b>to</b> command which he had drawn within his sphere the large vessel that contained it, and helped himself, amid the confusion, to a sevenfold portion.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled <b>broths</b> <b>to</b> the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|R
