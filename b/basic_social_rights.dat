25|$|Throughout the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century and prior to the revolution, many women leaders emerged and demanded <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> for women. During the reign of Reza Shah, the government mandated the removal of the veil and promoted the education of young girls. However, the push-back of the Shii clerics made progress difficult, and the government had to contain its promotion of basic women's rights to the norms of the patriarchal social hierarchy in order to accommodate the clergy. After the abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, the discipline of the government decreased, and women were able to further exercise their rights, including the ability to wear the veil if they wanted. More organization of women's groups occurred in the 1960s and 70s, and they used the government’s modernization to define and advocate for women’s issues. During these decades, women became active in formerly male domains such as the parliament, the cabinet, armed forces, legal professions, and fields of science and technology. Additionally, women achieved the right to vote in 1963. Many of these achievements and rights that Iranian women had gained in the decades leading up to the revolution were reversed by the Islamic Revolution.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the Council of Europe has {{expressed}} deep concern over irregular migrants’ poor access to <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights.</b> With this mind, I consider {{the extent to which}} the European Convention on Human Rights can contribute to protect irregular migrants in the social sphere. To this end, I consider the role of international supervisory bodies in social rights adjudication and discuss the suitability of international adjudication as a means to uphold irregular migrants’ social rights. Having reached the conclusion that international adjudication can help protect irregular migrants’ social rights, I examine the ‘social dimension’ of the European Convention on Human Rights and the significance that the European Court of Human Rights attaches to immigration status. I posit that the importance that the Court attaches to resource and immigration policy considerations in N v. United Kingdom significantly constrains the ability of the European Convention on Human Rights to afford irregular migrants protection in the social sphere...|$|E

40|$|In 1988 Brazil {{was one of}} {{the first}} Latin American {{countries}} to frame access to health care as a constitutional right, but, in fact, it has not produced coverage of its citizens. Brazil's Unified Health System (Sistema de Sa, or SUS in Portuguese) cannot quite be described as a public health system that provides universal access and comprehensive care. This article reveals that there seems to be a strong contradiction between the redistributive model set in the Brazilian Constitution and the inadequate level of public spending on health. On the one hand, the law claims that health care is a <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>right,</b> allocated by need rather than by affordability. In 2003, on the other hand, Brazil spent just US 597 per capita on health or 7. 6 percent of its GDP, while the average country according to OECD spent US 3, 145 or 10. 8 percent, and the average Latin American country spent US 622 or 6. 7 percent of its GDP...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{development}} of fundamental rights mechanisms in the EU, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the governance of the Eurozone has led to policies that have undermined <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is to explain why it is that the EU has been able to act in this manner despite the assurances supposedly enshrined in its own rights guarantees. To do this, recent advancements in critical integration theory that posit European integration as the outcome of competing hegemonic projects are drawn upon. The construction of fundamental rights is conceptualised within the context of the institutional framework of the EU and the current dominant neoliberal project. It is argued that the process of construction of rights has led to a highly restrictive understanding of what the concept of fundamental rights entails in the EU. This has allowed EU institutions to rhetorically commit to rights while simultaneously acting to undermine rights in practice...|$|E

40|$|Starting from S. Huntington’s {{observation}} that {{the main issue of}} many ongoing conflicts is about fundamental diversities in the ways, in which civilizations concretize fundamental values in their specific spatio-temporal situation, the second section examines an important source of value conflicts, namely in the field of human rights. I argue that the current declarations of human rights, which have been officially recognized by international bodies, such as the United Nations, basically consist of three groups of human rights, namely the individual freedom rights, the <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights,</b> and the cultural rights, which rest on fundamentally diverging values. These differences result in two different kinds of value conflicts: conflicts being fought out in a homogeneous playing field, resulting, ideally, in consensus, and conflicts being fought out in a heterogeneous field, which often precludes the possibility of consensus. A typical example of a homogeneous value conflict is the divergence between individual freedom rights and <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights,</b> whereas a heterogeneous value conflict is exemplified in the difference between cultural rights and the two other sets of rights. The reason that heterogeneous value conflicts are so difficult to solve is the lack of a common ground of, phrased positively, the importance of cultural individuality; certain cultural values may be fundamental for a given culture, while being unacceptable or even appalling to other ones. In the third section, I will give a short philosophical analysis of the differences between value conflicts in a homogeneous and a heterogeneous playing field, and argue that the latter have become predominant in the current situation of radical cultural diversity. In the final section, I try to develop {{a solution to the problem}} of value conflict in a heterogeneous space by making use of the ideas of dialogical pluralism and cultural value reasoning, being examples of practical wisdom. Dialogical pluralism can be defined as a conscious, well-organized critical dialogue between people who are living conflicting values in a heterogeneous field. Cultural value reasoning aims at stimulating a self-reflective attitude among the people who participate in such a dialogue, without requiring them to give up the fundamental character of their values to them...|$|E

The study shows that states perceive the conferment of <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> on irregular migrants as an erosion of the government's immigration power notwithstanding their characterisation as human rights.

40|$|The recent law on fiscal {{federalism}} {{opens the}} path to the real introduction of federalism in Italy. The Italian State’s evolution towards federalism began in the 1990 s and led to constitutional reform in 2001. Nevertheless, for the following years regions and local bodies have hardly been able to profit from the new powers they were endowed with, since they have continued to rely on the previous model of financing expenditures. This model was very centralistic, because it accorded regions state grants rather than powers to levy taxes. This system has fostered, in a concrete way, political and financial unaccountability; because the regions that did not tailor their expenses according to the state funding were given extra grants by the State. Moreover, it has not provided equal public services throughout the country, because the regions in deficit often offered worse services than those provided in the regions that complied with the budget they were allocated. This model was finally substituted with the new one this year. The new model attributes to regions and local bodies real tax powers, together with moderate grants to ensure <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>right.</b> It aims at achieving greater accountability at regional and local levels, through a system of innovative incentives, disincentives, and sanctions...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the trilemma the EU {{is facing}} concerning three fundamental principles {{on which the}} Community rests: free movement of services and labour; non-discrimination and equal treatment, {{and the rights of}} association and industrial action. With rising cross-border flows of services and (posted) labour after the Eastward enlargement, the conflict between these rights has triggered industrial disputes and judicial strife. In the view of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), highlighted in the Laval Quartet, some principles are more fundamental than others. Tracing the 'dual track' along which European integration has evolved, whereby supranational market integration has been combined with national semi-sovereignty in industrial relations and social policies, our claim is that the supremacy of free movement over <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> implied by the ECJ judgments is leading Europe in a politically and socially unsustainable direction. To prevent erosion of the European Social Models and of popular support for European integration, the politicians have to reinsert themselves into the governance of the European project.

40|$|In {{this article}} a process-tracing {{approach}} {{is used to}} explore how different factors {{have contributed to the}} development of healthcare policy in Bolivia, in light of the current proposal to introduce a unified public healthcare system. The main findings are that although international relations and state bureaucrats have been crucial to the process of formulating policies, the introduction of comprehensive reform will depend on the ability of groups who currently lack access to the healthcare system to form progressive coalitions promoting universalism, as well as the ability of those who benefit from the current arrangements to maintain the status quo. The ability to introduce comprehensive reforms is thus connected to the ongoing processes of decentralisation and democratisation of political decision-making in Bolivia. Although state - corporative welfare state institutions {{have been shown to be}} difficult to transform, low coverage levels in such systems combined with a process of increasing political inclusion of previously marginalised groups poses serious challenges to the status quo as the social aspect of citizenship is brought up on the agenda. In order to achieve universal coverage of the healthcare system, however, <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> of all citizens must be institutionalised at the same time as the scope and quality of services must be secured in order to avoid segmentation and to encourage the financial participation of the formal and middle income sectorsBolivia, Health care, Social policy, Institutional change, Power resources, Policy diffusion. ...|$|E

40|$|Social {{rights are}} {{programmatic}} standards fixed on Article 6 of the 1988 Federal Constitution Because of this feature, they require state action aimed to achieve them. It {{means that in}} order to those rules take effect, the government should allocate specific resources and provide public policts. These policts require high public spending, and state planning accordingly. As a result, often the state evades this obligation using to justify the reservation of theory as possible, and fails to meet the basic needs of the population. In this context, arises the importance of the judiciary.

40|$|As {{an avenue}} to {{guarantee}} and ensure {{the enjoyment of}} right to freedom of private and family life, spouses have been permitted and encouraged by various laws to get married to one another. The concept of marriage has been generally understood and confined within the following meaning: “a legal union between a male and a female {{with a view to}} becoming husband and wife. ” Such definition precludes any unionism that may occur between same-sex couples in a manner contrary to the law and public policy. In the recent past, the Government of Nigeria has signed into law a bill known as “Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Bill, 2011 ”. The Bill prohibits a marriage between two same couples and all sort of matters connected therewith such as forming a union {{that has to do with}} same-sex marriage. The prohibition has been supported by the religious declarations, people’s culture, public policy and morals in the country. The passage of the Bill into law has attracted series of condemnations by some of the international community and the proponents of same-sex marriage. For it is said to have been enacted contrary to the human rights law and the Nigerian constitution. According to the proponents of same-sex marriage, the passage of the Bill into law is an attempt to deprive some minorities of their <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> such as right to freedom of private and family life; freedom to assemble peacefully; and freedom from discrimination as contained under the International, regional and domestic instruments.

30|$|Forced return {{has always}} been a contested part of the {{politics}} of migration control. Not only must returning instruments comply with human rights provisions, their implementation also faces technical and practical constraints. As a result of impediments and international safeguards, some migrants without a residency status cannot be removed from the state’s territory. Practical barriers concern the relations between the host country and the country of origin (e.g. lack of readmission agreements) and are deemed to lie partly in the capacity of the individual (e.g. non-cooperation with identification papers and travel documents). However, liberal states have only limited tools to eliminate such practical or technical barriers (Trauner & Kruse, 2008). Against this background, countries have turned to cooperation with return (CWR) as a policy tool to regulate better presence and access to social rights. Only once active cooperation with the return has been demonstrated and confirmed by the authorities is the migrant treated as non-removable and earns the right to reside for a certain period of time. In addition, some countries couple this requirement for remaining with access to social services, on the assumptions that this will make return strategies more efficient. In other words: Migration control is carried out with the help of conditional access to <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights.</b> The tool combines a duty with a right, if a person cooperates with return processes, then he/she may be granted stay and welfare support. This approach relates directly to the so-called migration/social policy nexus which serves as the main analytical frame for discussing CWR as a policy tool (Bommes & Geddes, 2000; Goldring & Landolt, 2013; Guiraudon & Joppke, 2001; Wright, 2016).|$|E

Nesse contexto está inserido o Programa Bolsa Família (PBF), que, além da transferência de renda, visa a garantia de acesso aos direitos sociais básicos. Este estudo objetiva analisar a operacionalização do PBF e, consequentemente, o entendimento dos profissionais de saúde a respeito do programa, enquanto eixo estruturante da política pública de SAN. Para isso, realizou-se entrevistas semiestruturadas com trabalhadores da atenção primária, envolvidos diretamente, tanto com o PBF, quanto com as famílias que recebem este beneficio. Ao final do estudo, foi possível evidenciar a importância da formação dos profissionais que atuam nessa área, pois, ao desconectar a realidade social em que os beneficiários estão inseridos, dos objetivos do programa, colabora-se para a simples mecanização dessas práticas. Nesse sentido, aponta-se que os profissionais de saúde precisam entender as proposições do programa como estratégias político-sociais, as quais, para além do alívio imediato, visam a superação dos problemas relacionados à pobreza e à fome.

By the end of the study, it was possible to perceive the importance of training health professionals who work in this area, because when one dissociates the social reality in which the beneficiaries live from the program objectives, this can lead to the simple mechanization of these practices. In this respect, it should be stressed that health professionals need to understand the proposals of the program as political and social strategies which, in addition to providing immediate relief, strive to overcome the problems related to poverty and hunger...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Focus This thesis investigates {{inclusive}} education {{policy and practice}} in South Africa. In this context, particular focus {{is given to the}} rights and needs of visually impaired learners and students. Background Due to the dual segregated education system, as at 2001, approximately 280 000 disabled children did not have access to education at school. The special schools system fostered inequality and discrimination of disabled learners from an early age. This stood in tension with the South African Constitution and was not in line with international trends. This ‘normative tension’ and lack of alignment with evolving international practice led to a shift towards an {{inclusive education}} system as a policy preference. Policy In 1996 the Constitution and the South African Schools Act prescribed that everyone had the right to basic education and should not be discriminated against on any grounds. Mainstream schools catered for able-bodied learners, and existing legislation did not automatically equip schools and teachers with resources and training to accommodate disabled learners. To enable directives to obtain these objectives, Education White Paper 6 was passed in 2001. This policy documented Government’s intent to implement an inclusive education system by 2021. Investigation The educational needs of visually impaired learners were identified and discussed. An analysis of White Paper 6, highlighting its strengths and limitations in light of the identified specialised educational needs, was conducted. Research was undertaken in mainstream schools, special schools and universities to assess the progress of the implementation process. Challenges impeding the process including untrained educators, insufficient funding, and no established provisioning norms were identified. Inclusive education has its foundations within social rights theory. Education, like other <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> is a justiciable right which the State must uphold. However, like all normative wish lists of rights, limited resources, competing claimants and policy trade-offs are inevitable, more especially in a developing country. As a result budgets, utilisation of funds and accountability of the Department of Education were also investigated. Conclusion Following an analysis of the contents of the policy and findings on the progress of the implementation process, policy recommendations- informed by the researchwere proposed...|$|E

Thus, we verify that the <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> of the vulnerable and abandonned groups donât consolidate, becoming for this reason in a picture of social inequalities, poverty and indigence. When we speak about the relation between health and sanitation is essential to include it in the spoken subject of the relation health and environment. The first confirmation, in this aspect, show preoccupations about the relation health-sanitation. They were certainly in {{the root of the}} actual sight health-environment. The questions about sanitation were almost exclusive, especially before the Industrial Revolution. They were that characterized historically the environment of the health. This correlation between basic sanitation and health represented here by the Tax of Incidence of tre sicknesses brought by the veiculation of the water, the Viral Hepatite, was studied by the counties of the State of CearÃ, as a way to measure the influence of the operation of the CAGECE to improve the peopleâs health conditions in relation to the counties that werenât operate by this company...|$|E
40|$|MM - P&DMThe mid- 1970 s South Africa saw the {{emergence}} of movements opposing apartheid policies. The composition of these movements have varied from individuals coming together in pursuit of <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> to the more complex formations seeking a complete overhaul of all apartheid machinery which would translate into democracy. These movements or formations together {{with a host of}} others became known as civil society in the post-apartheid South Africa. The purpose of this research was to investigate the role of South African civil society in post-apartheid defence policy-making. It sought to achieve this by analysing previous and current trends followed by government in the defence policy-making processes. In particular, it focused on government’s engagement of civil society in defence policy-making processes, periodised as (i) the development and adoption of the White Paper on Defence (1996), (ii) Defence Review (1998) and briefly touches on the current policy review known as (iii) the Defence Update (2004). Case study materials were gathered by means of primary and secondary data collection methods where the former utilised semi-structured interviews with key individuals involved in defence policy-making processes. Much has been published about the first two cases and secondary data was collected from available literature on the subject. The examination of civil society participation in defence policy shows that South African civil society has made significant progress in penetrating and engaging the government in processes previously perceived as the reserve of the elite. The 1990 to 1998 period experienced unprecedented political fluidity, where civil society made an impact in influencing policy outcomes. However, the findings identified a trend in a review currently being carried out by the Department of Defence (DOD) where there has been a notable reduction of civil society participation, and very little being revealed about it. ix The study concludes that civil society is an important player in the democratisation project and the Ministry of Defence needs to ensure that civil society remains a player in policy making by strengthening its involvement in this process. One of the key recommendations is that both the Ministry and civil society establish parameters for the latter’s participation in policy processes, with a view to establishing of a forum comprised of all key actors in the sector i. e. policy makers, academics, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), research institutions etc. to facilitate dialogue on policy issue...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether the state, through {{conditional cash transfer}} programs (CCT), can reduce the poverty and extremely poverty in societies marred by high levels of income concentration. We focus {{on one of the}} most unequal countries in the globe, Brazil, and analyze the extent to which this country's CCT program - Bolsa Família (BF, Family Grant) program - is able to improve the life chances of extremely poor beneficiaries, through the three major goals of PBF: First, to immediately end hunger; second, to create <b>basic</b> <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> related to healthcare and education; finally, considering also complementary policies, to integrate adults into the job market. The analysis relies on a quantitative survey with 4, 000 beneficiaries and a qualitative survey comprised of in-depth interviews with 38 program's participants from all the regions of the country in 2008, it means that this study is about the five first years of the PBF. In order to answer the research questions, we ran four probit analyses related: a) the determinants of the realization of prenatal care; b) the determinants of food security among BF beneficiaries, c) the determinants that adult BF recipients will return to school, d) the determinants that a BF beneficiary will obtain a job. Important results from the study are: First, those who before their participation on PBF were at the margins have now been able to access healthcare services on a more regular basis. Thus, the women at the margins who were systematically excluded - black women, poorly educated and from the North - now, after their participation in the CCT program, have more access to prenatal care and can now count with more availability of public healthcare network. Second, before entering the Bolsa Família program, 50. 3 % of the participants faced severe food insecurity. This number went down to 36. 8 % in very five years. Men are more likely than women; non-blacks more likely than blacks; and South and Centre-West residents more likely than Brazilians from other regions; to become food secure while participating in BF. Third, instead, that moment in 2008, a small proportion of the adult participants indeed were able to return to school and to increase their educational qualifications. The lack of technical skills and the huge predominance of informal employment are central social problems in Brazil and that the PBF has failed to address such issues. This study confirms what other previous studies have reported on: BF has had a positive impact in reducing poverty in the country. Hence the main contribution of the present study is in identifying the main determinants of unequal results among individuals participating in the BF program: why some, but not others, are more easily able to access the healthcare or to overcome food insecurity while in the program...|$|E
40|$|The {{shift towards}} non-state {{supplementary}} pensions across Europe raises fundamental issues regarding governance especially {{in respect to}} guaranteeing <b>basic</b> participatory and <b>social</b> <b>rights.</b> As a result of different state or collective regulation, the coverage, the benefit formula, and the funding modes vary across supplementary pension systems. Based on country studies, this international project compares the evolution of supplementary pensions, focusing {{on the role of}} the state and social partners in regulating private and occupational pensions. The project investigates the impact of these pension governance modes: The study will show how different social groups (such as full-time/part-time employed, normal/atypical workers) are insured through supplementary pensions, how their interests are represented in such pen-sion funds, and how their retirement income will be affected by national and sector-specific contexts. The comparison of Germany with nine European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Fin...|$|R

A key proposition is that working effectively for children’s rights involves many of the same strategies and implementation methods that have proved successful in numerous development efforts worldwide. The rights approach is inherently more concerned with issues of equity, non-discrimination and social justice, but it cannot afford to neglect the challenge of resource mobilization. And in this regard our conception of societal ‘resources’ must be extended beyond the limited finances of governments to encompass human, technological, cultural and organizational capabilities. child development; children's rights; convention {{on the rights of the}} child; economic and social development; implementation of the crc;Developing Countries;...|$|R
