5|$|When {{citizens}} of Dodge City learned the Earps had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder after the gunfight, they sent letters endorsing {{and supporting the}} Earps to Judge Wells Spicer.|$|E
5|$|Although McCarthy had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> first-degree murder, {{the judge}} allowed {{the jury to}} {{consider}} lesser charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. On June 26, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder and two days later {{he was sentenced to}} life imprisonment; he will be eligible for parole in 2037.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December, a joint {{statement}} was issued by DCS Gull and Michael Crimp, senior prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Suffolk, announcing that the second suspect identified as Steve Wright had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the murder of all five women.|$|E
50|$|Eight of the Lakonias {{officers}} <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> negligence. Captain Zarbis, {{his first}} officer and the ship’s security officer <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> gross negligence. The other five men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> simple negligence.|$|R
25|$|On Monday, 2 May 1983, both Larson and Lee <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Swift's murder. They <b>were</b> also <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the {{unlawful}} imprisonment of Anita Charlotte Swift and Paul Andrew Swift, {{and having}} committed a robbery while {{armed with a}} rifle. Prior to the trial, the unlawful imprisonment <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped, and both men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder and both <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> armed robbery.|$|R
25|$|The {{three men}} <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{involvement}} in 29 separate incidents, including 21 murders and eight more attacks where victims survived. Suprunyuk <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 27 of the cases, including 21 counts of capital murder, eight armed robberies, and {{one count of}} animal cruelty. Sayenko <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 25 instances, including 18 murders, five robberies and one count of animal cruelty. Hanzha <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> two counts of armed robbery stemming from a 1 March 2007 incident in Dniprodzerzhynsk.|$|R
5|$|Since 1990, the {{drainage}} boards have <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> watching the rhynes {{and keeping them}} clear, under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency. With rising sea levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences {{is likely to become}} more expensive, and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created. Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|After {{rendering}} non-combat {{service in}} the Spanish–American War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He {{made a name for}} himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of a black man who had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President William Howard Taft in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.|$|E
50|$|Seven men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{first-degree murder}} and home {{invasion}} robbery, and an eighth suspect <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> being an accessory after the fact.|$|R
50|$|Martin, a 15-year veteran {{with the}} police department, <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{conspiracy}} to distribute cocaine. Blythe, with three years of service, <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> transferring a firearm.Bell, Jones and Middlebrook <b>were</b> all <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and Middlebrook for Money Laundering.|$|R
50|$|Two teenage men, James O'Connor and Gavin Alker, <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the murder. Christopher Douglas <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> witness {{intimidation}} {{in relation to}} the case.|$|R
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women should never have <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration {{is that of}} forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|According to BBC, {{police in}} Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport {{have participated in}} a series of these scams, robbing {{tourists}} of thousands of dollars each time. A British couple <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> stealing a wallet, an Irish woman <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> stealing eye-liner, and an Australian man <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> stealing a doughnut, all in July 2009.|$|R
50|$|In December 1996, Darin Mazzarella <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the 1994 {{murder of}} Louis Balancio and Anthony Santorelli <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{throwing}} the bloody clothes into the dumpster.|$|R
50|$|Moscatiello and Ferrari <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> first-degree murder, {{conspiracy}} to commit murder, and solicitation to commit murder. Fiorillo <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> first-degree murder and {{conspiracy to}} commit murder.|$|R
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{departed}} Rio de Janeiro on 11 August 1837 for Salvador, {{capital of}} the province of Bahia. He had <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> delivering the prisoner Bento Gonçalves (leader of the rebellion known as the Ragamuffin War that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul since 1835) to a military fortress. On 7 September 1837, Joaquim Inácio was promoted to captain lieutenant. A couple of months later, the Sabinada rebellion erupted in Salvador. The rebels freed Bento Gonçalves, who escaped back to Rio Grande do Sul. Joaquim Inácio {{took part in the}} blockade of that city {{until the end of the}} rebellion in March 1838. His lack of family connections and political influence again stymied his career in 1839, when he was passed over for a well-deserved promotion.|$|E
5|$|People {{who have}} <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{offences}} are tried {{either in the}} ACT Magistrates Court or for more severe offences, the ACT Supreme Court. Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually gaoled in New South Wales. The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130million. Courts such as a Small Claims Tribunal and a Family Court exist for civil law actions and other non-criminal legal matters.|$|E
50|$|No {{one else}} <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the bombings, or {{supplying}} the material; three police officers <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> conspiracy to pervert {{the course of}} justice, and found not guilty.|$|R
50|$|The {{three men}} who gave sworn {{statements}} were Veverka, Hanlon and Meier. Hanlon <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> felonies, while Veverka <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a civil rights violation, but was acquitted.|$|R
50|$|The men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> rape, and Morgan <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{aiding and}} abetting the others to commit rape. He <b>was</b> not <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> rape {{because at the time}} it was {{believed}} that a husband has an absolute defence in law by virtue of being married to the victim.|$|R
5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder only twice.|$|E
5|$|While making The Gold Rush, Chaplin {{married for}} the second time. Mirroring the {{circumstances}} of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> statutory rape under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} murder, D.C. police {{alleged that}} the crime scene had been {{tampered}} with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky and Ward with obstruction of justice and conspiracy related to alleged tampering with the crime scene. The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. No one has <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Wone's killing. In November 2008, Wone's widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011 for an undisclosed sum and agreement.|$|E
50|$|In January 2006, KSS members Edward Robert Locke and Todd Clair Sager <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{multiple}} {{counts in}} connection with a violent bar fight in March 2005 in New Stanton. Police claim Locke stabbed two men. Locke <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> attempted homicide and four counts of aggravated assault while Sager <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> criminal solicitation to commit homicide and criminal solicitation to commit aggravated assault.|$|R
50|$|Fitzgerald's {{report was}} {{submitted}} on 3 July 1989. Based on the inquiry's final report, {{a number of}} high-profile politicians <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> crimes; notably Queensland Police Commissioner (Sir) Terry Lewis <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> corruption.|$|R
50|$|Armenian-Turkish writer, Sevan Nişanyan, <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 58 {{weeks in}} jail for an alleged insult to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad in a blog post, under similar charges to those Fazil Say <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Tzemah, the Haganah command {{realized}} {{the importance of the}} campaign in the region, and made a clear separation between the Kinarot Valley, and the Battle of Gesher fought against Transjordan and Iraq to the south. On May 18, Moshe Dayan, who had been born in Degania, was given command of all forces in the area, after having <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade just a day before. A company of reinforcements from the Gadna program was allocated, along with 3 PIATs. Other reinforcements {{came in the form of}} a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley. The Palmach counterattack on the police station on the night of May 18 gave the Israeli forces an additional day to prepare defense and attack plans.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who has <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
50|$|Monis <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 12 counts under s 471.12 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. In addition, Amirah Droudis <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> eight {{counts of}} {{aiding and abetting}} Monis in the {{commission}} of those offences.|$|R
50|$|On February 26, 2010 Providence police charged {{four women}} from two city spas on {{prostitution}} charges. Three {{of the women}} <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> prostitution, {{and one of the}} women <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> permitting prostitution.|$|R
25|$|On 3 February 1945, Reginald Gough <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{manslaughter}} and Esther Gough with wilful ill-treatment, {{neglect and}} exposure {{likely to cause}} suffering and injury. On 12 February 1945 she, too, <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> manslaughter.|$|R
