5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{attracted}} the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E

5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of O.nidiformis fruit bodies is best seen in low-light conditions {{when the}} viewer's eyes have become dark-adapted. The gills {{are the most}} luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age.

It is not known if the mycelium is also luminescent.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy is <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> to be {{seen with}} the naked eye, even with some light pollution. Andromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the Northern Hemisphere, when from {{mid-latitudes}} the galaxy reaches zenith and can be seen almost all night. From the Southern Hemisphere, it is a springtime object and does not reach a high altitude over the northern horizon, thus making it difficult to observe. Binoculars can reveal some larger structures and its two brightest satellite galaxies, M32 and M110. An amateur telescope can reveal Andromeda's disk, dark dust lanes, the large star cloud NGC 206, and even some of its brightest globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E
5|$|All four Galilean moons are <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> {{that they}} could be sighted from Earth without a telescope, if they were farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> to {{be noticed}} by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E

50|$|The F-105F did not utilize {{radar jamming}} devices since its {{purpose was to}} provide a decoy target, {{protecting}} the strike flights, and encouraging SAM launches that generated <b>enough</b> <b>bright</b> smoke to make possible seeing the SAM site for immediate dive bombing attack. With multiple incoming missiles in visual sight it was possible to dive abruptly or sharply break to avoid them. Failure to see the missiles approaching at three times fighter cruise speed would result in the destruction of the aircraft and failure of the mission.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{fluorescent}} organic nanoparticles with size {{of about}} 300 nm were prepared by nanosecond laser ablation of micrometer-sized powder of dendronized perylenediimide dispersed in water.

5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Kappa Pyxidis was catalogued but {{not given}} a Bayer {{designation}} by Lacaille, however Gould felt the star was <b>bright</b> <b>enough</b> {{to warrant a}} letter. Kappa has a magnitude of 4.62 and is 560 ± 50 light-years distant. An orange giant of spectral type K4/K5III, Kappa has a luminosity approximately 965 {{times that of the}} Sun. It is separated by 2.1 arcseconds from a magnitude 10 star. Theta Pyxidis is a red giant of spectral type M1III and semi-regular variable with two measured periods of 13 and 98.3 days, and an average magnitude of 4.71, and is 500 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. It has expanded to approximately 54 times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna resurrected {{the question of}} which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern–Levison parameter estimated to be much less than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is <b>bright</b> <b>enough,</b> and therefore large enough, that this {{is expected to be}} the case, and several astronomers have called it one.|$|E
50|$|Three general {{approaches}} for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single-particle tracking, correlation spectroscopy and photomarking methods. In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both <b>bright</b> and sparse <b>enough</b> to be tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects {{into and out}} of a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly. Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells.|$|R
5000|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} 25% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 4.6/10 based on 115 reviews.

[...] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 39 based on 32 reviews, indicating [...] "generally unfavorable reviews". However, the film earned an A− from audiences polled by CinemaScore.|$|R
40|$|Only certain {{galaxies are}} {{included}} in surveys: those <b>bright</b> and large <b>enough</b> to be detectable as extended sources. Because gravitational lensing can make galaxies appear both brighter and larger, the presence of foreground inhomogeneities can scatter galaxies across not only magnitude cuts but also size cuts, changing the statistical properties of the resulting catalog. Here we explore this size bias, and how it combines with magnification bias to affect galaxy statistics. We demonstrate that photometric galaxy samples from current and upcoming surveys can be even more affected by size bias than by magnification bias. Comment: 4 pages; 3 figures.
