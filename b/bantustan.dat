25|$|Afrikaans is also widely {{spoken in}} Namibia. Before independence, Afrikaans had equal status with German as an {{official}} language. Since independence in 1990, Afrikaans has had constitutional recognition as a national, but not official, language. There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among Zimbabwe's white minority, as most have left the country since 1980. Afrikaans was also a medium of instruction for schools in Bophuthatswana, an Apartheid-era <b>Bantustan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bantustans</b> {{within the}} borders of South Africa were {{classified}} as [...] "self-governing" [...] or [...] "independent". In theory, self-governing <b>Bantustans</b> had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent <b>Bantustans</b> (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei; {{also known as the}} TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no economic infrastructure worth mentioning and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the <b>Bantustans</b> were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970 made {{black people}} {{citizens}} {{of one of}} the <b>bantustans,</b> with the intention that when the <b>bantustans</b> became independent they would cease to be South African citizens.|$|R
50|$|The South African {{authorities}} established 10 <b>bantustans</b> in South West Africa in {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s {{in accordance with the}} Odendaal Commission, three of which were granted self-rule. These <b>bantustans</b> were replaced with separate ethnicity based governments in 1980.|$|R
25|$|The {{right to}} vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, {{established}} in 1963 for the Transkei <b>bantustan,</b> was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult coloured citizens were eligible {{to vote for the}} Coloured Persons Representative Council, which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult Indian citizens were eligible to vote for the South African Indian Council in 1981. In 1984 the Tricameral Parliament was established, and the {{right to vote}} for the House of Representatives and House of Delegates was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} of Afrikaans with apartheid prompted black South Africans to prefer English. Even the <b>Bantustan</b> regimes chose English and an indigenous African language as official languages. In addition, English was gaining prominence as the language {{most often used}} in commerce and industry. The 1974 decree was intended to forcibly reverse the decline of Afrikaans among black Africans. The Afrikaner-dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Union of South Africa Act that recognised only English and Dutch (the latter being replaced by Afrikaans in 1925) as official languages as the pretext to do so. While all schools had to provide instruction in both Afrikaans and English as languages, white South African students learned other subjects in their home language.|$|E
500|$|Biko opposed any {{collaboration}} with the apartheid government, such as the agreements that the Coloured and Indian communities made with the regime. In his view, the <b>Bantustan</b> system was [...] "the greatest single fraud ever invented by white politicians", stating that {{it was designed to}} divide the Bantu-speaking African population along tribal lines. He openly criticised the Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, stating that the latter's co-operation with the South African government [...] " [...] the cause" [...] of black liberation. He believed that those fighting apartheid in South Africa should link with anti-colonial struggles elsewhere in the world and with activists in the global African diaspora combating racial prejudice and discrimination. He also hoped that foreign countries would boycott South Africa's economy.|$|E

Moreover, these <b>Bantustans</b> were encouraged to accept „independence ‟ so that the „white ‟ South African government did not have to manage their affairs. These government policies had adverse effects on the lives of the African population. In this paper, I focus on health policies and try to analyze the impact of health inputs on the health of African children, particularly those living in the <b>Bantustans.</b> This paper finds a positive effect of health inputs (provision of a health facility, health expenditure per capita) on the health of the African children, particularly those living in independent <b>Bantustans.</b> ...|$|R
