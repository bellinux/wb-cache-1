40|$|Collective {{motion in}} nonequilibrium steady state {{suspensions}} of self-propelled Janus motors driven by chemical reactions can arise due to interactions coming from direct intermolecular forces, hydrodynamic flow effects, or chemotactic effects mediated by chemical gradients. The {{relative importance of}} these interactions depends on the reactive characteristics of the motors, {{the way in which}} the system is maintained in a steady state, and properties of the suspension, such as the volume fraction. From simulations of a microscopic hard collision model for the interaction of fluid particles with the Janus motor we show that dynamic cluster states exist and determine the interaction mechanisms that are responsible for their formation. The relative importance of chemotactic and hydrodynamic effects is identified by considering a microscopic model in which chemotactic effects are turned off while the full hydrodynamic interactions are retained. The system is maintained in a steady state by means of a <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> in which product particles are reconverted into fuel particles.

40|$|Precipitation-dissolution {{reactions}} {{are important for}} a number of applications such as isotopic tracer transport in the subsurface. Analytical solutions have been developed for tracer transport in both single-fracture and multiple-fracture systems associated with these reactions under transient and steady-state transport conditions. These solutions also take into account advective transport in fractures and molecular diffusion in the rock matrix. For studying distributions of disturbed tracer concentration (the difference between actual concentration and its equilibrium value), effects of precipitation-dissolution {{reactions are}} mathematically equivalent to a 'decay' process with a decay constant proportional to the corresponding <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> rate. This important feature significantly simplifies the derivation procedure by taking advantage of the existence of analytical solutions for tracer transport associated with radioactive decay in fractured rock. It is also useful for interpreting tracer breakthrough curves, because the impact of a decay process is relatively easy to analyze. Several illustrative examples are presented, which show that the results are sensitive to fracture spacing, matrix diffusion coefficient (fracture surface area), and <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> rate (or 'decay' constant), indicating that the relevant flow and transport parameters may be estimated by analyzing tracer signals...|$|E

40|$|Water is a {{polar solvent}} and hence {{supports}} the bulk dissociation of {{itself and its}} solutes into ions, and the re-association of these ions into neutral molecules in a dynamic equilibrium, e. g., H_ 2 O_ 2 H^+ + HO_ 2 ^-. Using continuum theory, we study the influence of these reactions on the self-propulsion of colloids driven by surface chemical reactions (chemical swimmers) in aqueous solution. The association-dissociation reactions are here shown {{to have a strong}} influence on the swimmers' behaviour, and must therefore be included in future modelling. In particular, such <b>bulk</b> <b>reactions</b> permit charged swimmers to propel electrophoretically even if all species involved in the surface reactions are neutral. The <b>bulk</b> <b>reactions</b> also significantly modify the predicted speed of chemical swimmers propelled by ionic currents, by up to an order of magnitude. For swimmers whose surface reactions produce both anions and cations (ionic self-diffusiophoresis), the <b>bulk</b> <b>reactions</b> produce an additional reactive screening length, analogous to the Debye length in electrostatics. This in turn leads to an inverse relationship between swimmer radius and swimming speed, which could provide an alternative explanation for recent experimental observations on Pt-polystyrene Janus swimmers [S. Ebbens et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 020401 (2012) ]. We also use our continuum theory to investigate the effect of the Debye screening length itself, going beyond the infinitely thin limit approximation used by previous analytical theories. We identify significant departures from this limiting behavior for micron-sized swimmers under typical experimental conditions, and find that the limiting behavior fails entirely for nanoscale swimmers.

40|$|A voting model (or a {{generalization}} of the Glauber model at zero temperature) on a multidimensional lattice {{is defined as}} a system composed of a lattice each site of which is either empty or occupied by a single particle. The reactions of the system are such that two adjacent sites, one empty the other occupied, may evolve to a state where both of these sites are either empty or occupied. The continuum version of this model in a Ddimensional region with boundary is studied, and two general behaviors of such systems are investigated. The stationary behavior of the system, and the dominant way of the relaxation of the system toward its stationary state. Based on the first behavior, the static phase transition (discontinuous changes in the stationary profiles of the system) is studied. Based on the second behavior, the dynamical phase transition (discontinuous changes in the relaxation-times of the system) is studied. It is shown that the static phase transition is induced by the <b>bulk</b> <b>reactions</b> only, while the dynamical phase transition is a result of both <b>bulk</b> <b>reactions</b> and boundary conditions.

40|$|Abstract Available {{constraints}} on metamorphic reaction rates {{derived from the}} study of natural systems are similar to, or slightly lower than, the bulk strain rates measured in the same rocks. Here, we explore whether this apparent relationship is merely coincidence or due to a more fundamental mechanistic link between reac-tion and strain. Grain boundary migration accommo-dated dislocation creep (GBMDC) or grain boundary diffusion creep (GBDC) (i. e. pressure solution), both of which involve dissolution-precipitation as we define it, will occur simultaneously with mineral reactions involving dissolution-precipitation {{in the presence of a}} non-zero deviatoric stress. The exact relationships be-tween reaction and strain are different depending on whether GBMDC or GBDC is controlling strain, but the mechanistic link exists in both cases. We present theoretical arguments which show that bulk strain by GBMDC or GBDC, which may additionally be accommodated by processes not involving dissolution-precipitation, such as dislocation glide and climb or grain boundary sliding, should in most cases be some-what faster than the <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> rates as observed. With few exceptions, for natural metamorphic systems undergoing plastic deformation, strain rates provide an upper limit for <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> rates occurring simulta-neously in the same rocks.

We include the <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> O→O^ 2 -+ 2 h, where neutral atoms (a) go into ions (i) and holes (h). For slow, steady transport, the transport equations simplify because the <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> rate density r and the bulk loading rates ∂_t n then are uniform in space and time. All three fluxes j must be specified at each surface, which for a uniform current density J corresponds to five independent fluxes. These fluxes generate two types of static modes at each surface and a bulk response with a voltage profile that varies quadratically in space, characterized by J and the total oxygen flux j_O (neutral plus ion) at each surface. One type of surface mode is associated with electrical screening; the other type is associated both with diffusion and drift, and with chemical reaction (the diffusion-reaction mode). The diffusion-reaction mode is accompanied by changes in the chemical potentials μ, and by reactions and fluxes, but it neither carries current (J= 0) nor loads the system chemically (j_O= 0). Generation of the diffusion-reaction mode may explain the phenomenon of "turbulence in the voltage" often observed near the electrodes of other mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs).

40|$|Ageing of {{particulate}} {{organic matter}} affects the composition and properties of atmospheric aerosol particles. Driven by temperature and humidity, the organic fraction can vary its physical state between liquid and amorphous solid, or rarely even crystalline. These transitions can influence the reaction kinetics due to limitations of mass transport in such (semi-) solid states, which in turn may influence the chemical ageing of particles containing such compounds. We have used coated wall flow tube experiments to investigate the reaction kinetics of the ozonolysis of shikimic acid, {{which serves as a}} proxy for oxygenated, water-soluble organic matter and can form a glass at room temperature. Particular attention was paid to how the presence of water influences the reaction, since it acts a plasticiser and thereby induces changes in the physical state. We analysed the results by means of a traditional resistor model, which assumes steady-state conditions. The ozonolysis rate of shikimic acid is strongly increased in the presence of water, a fact we attribute to the increased transport of O- 3 and shikimic acid through the condensed phase at lower viscosities. The analysis using the resistor model suggests that the system undergoes both surface and <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction.</b> The second-order rate coefficient of the <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> is 3. 7 (+ 1. 5 /- 3. 2) x 10 (3) L mol(- 1) s(- 1).

40|$|We {{present a}} kinetic double layer model {{coupling}} aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (K 2 -SUB) {{based on the}} PRA framework of gas-particle interactions (Pöschl et al., 2007). K 2 -SUB is applied to a popular model system of atmospheric heterogeneous chemistry: the interaction of ozone with oleic acid. We show that our modelling approach allows de-convoluting surface and bulk processes, {{which has been a}} controversial topic and remains an important challenge for the understanding and description of atmospheric aerosol transformation. In particular, we demonstrate how a detailed treatment of adsorption and reaction at the surface can be coupled to a description of <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> and transport that is consistent with traditional resistor model formulations. From literature data we have derived a consistent set of kinetic parameters that characterise mass transport and chemical reaction of ozone at the surface and in the bulk of oleic acid droplets. Due to the wide range of rate coefficients reported from different experimental studies, the exact proportions between surface and <b>bulk</b> <b>reaction</b> rates remain uncertain. Nevertheless, the model results suggest an important role of chemical reaction in the bulk and an upper limit of ~ 1 &times; 10 &minus; 11 cm 2 s&minus; 1 for the surface reaction rate coefficient. Sensitivity studies show that the surface accommodation coefficient of the gas-phase reactant has a strong non-linear influence on both surface and bulk chemical reactions.
