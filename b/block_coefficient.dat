40|$|International {{shipping}} transports more than 80 percent of global trade. Traditionally bulk carriers {{have been built}} to minimize construction cost and maximize cargo-carrying capacity, neglecting hydrodynamic characteristics. By 2025, all new ships {{will be required to}} be 30 % more energy efficient than those built in 2014. When designing bulk ships, a number of restrictions have already been applied even before the naval architect has stated designing the ship, e. g. port restrictions, canals and legislative limitations. This thesis investigate how speed performance and power requirements may be improved by lifting some of the restriction on main dimensions when designing ship hulls. Lindstad et al. (2013) introduce the idea that increasing the breadth of bulk carriers while keeping the length, draft and displacement constant, and thereby reducing the <b>block</b> <b>coefficient,</b> will be an efficient way of reducing the resistance and fuel consumption of a ship. Lindstad et al. (2013) uses an empirical model based on Holtrop and Mennen (1984) and conclude that the brake power is reduced with reduced <b>block</b> <b>coefficient.</b> However, when evaluating hull dimensions outside the range the empirical data is based on, the result obtained has high uncertainty. Numerical methods using CFD has been applied in combination with CAD program to optimize hull lines. Using CFD to calculate added resistance in waves is however very computational demanding and time consuming and can hardly be applied in an optimization process. By using a simplified numerical method {{on a wide range of}} hull designs, this thesis attempts to bridge the gap between the idea of Lindstad et al. (2013) and the numerical approach used in simulation based design. Based on an adaption of a commercial bulk carrier (CBC) and MOERI KVLCC 2 there has been designed two series of ships with a deadweight of 80 000 tons. The <b>block</b> <b>coefficient</b> varies from 0, 59 to 0, 8 for the MOERI KVLCC 2 series and 0, 64 to 0, 87 for the CBC series. When designing the hull and ship lines the focus has been on optimizing the bow, the transition between the bow and parallel midship area (forward shoulder), the parallel midship body and the stern area. Initially, the two numerical calculations programs ShipX and Michlet was tested. ShipX calculates the wave resistance of conventional monohull ships using potential theory. To make ShipX more robust it satisfies the boundary condition of the surface some distance away from the hull surface. The satisfying of the boundary condition makes it less prone to catch details in different hulls. Using Geritsma & Beukelman method combined with strip-theory approximation the added resistance in waves is calculated. Michlet is an open source research code utilizing thin ship theory to calculate wave resistance. The essential assumption is that the hull is thin, that is, the breadth is small compared to all other characteristic lengths of the problem. A benchmarking with the MOERI KVLCC 2 show that results from ShipX are correlating best with experimental results. ShipX is therefore used to calculate the calm water resistance and added resistance in waves for the two design series. When comparing the brake power as a function of <b>block</b> <b>coefficient</b> calculated using empirical and numerical methods there is a clear disagreement in the results. For both of the design series the empirical calculations show a decreasing brake power with decreasing <b>block</b> <b>coefficient,</b> giving no clear optimum. For the CBC series the numerical calculations show an optimal <b>block</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0, 73. For the MOERI KVLCC 2 series the numerical calculations show an optimal <b>block</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0, 78. In additions, results indicate that for a given <b>block</b> <b>coefficient</b> moving the longitudinal center of buoyancy (LCB) backward reduce the wave resistance. From the results it is concluded that the optimal <b>block</b> <b>coefficient</b> for ships in the New Panamax and Capesize segment (60 00...|$|E

Experiments were conducted using one-dimensional laboratory columns and stable monodisperse aqueous suspensions of negatively charged latex particles {{with a mean}} size of 1. 90 lm. The role of ionic strength was systematically investigated and six different monovalent salt concentrations (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 mM) were employed by addition of sodium chloride to the aqueous solution. A mathematical advection-dispersiondeposition transport model was adopted assuming that attachment and detachment of particles in the porous medium are concurrent mechanisms of particle filtration, and including a Langmuir-type blocking function to account for availability in deposition sites. The system of equations modeling colloid transport was solved numerically. Attachment rate and detachment rate coefficients were thereby determined for each employed ionic strength, {{as well as a}} <b>blocking</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{in the form of a}} maximum particle concentration in the solid phase. Therefore, functional relationships expressing the dependence of these coefficients on ionic strength were proposed, based on literature findings and present experimental observations. The existence of a critical salt deposition concentration (and release concentration) separating a favorable attachment (and detachment) regime from an unfavorable condition is assumed. In respect to the <b>blocking</b> <b>coefficient,</b> a power-law dependence on ionic strength is hypothesized. The proposed functional relationships proved adequate to reproduce the coefficient trends extrapolated from data fitting by the transport model. They may represent a powerful tool to describe and predict microparticle mobility in saturated porous media if embedded a priori in the related mathematical transport model...|$|R
