5|$|Chamberlain saw his {{elevation}} to the premiership as {{the final}} glory in {{a career as a}} domestic reformer, not realising that he would <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.|$|E
5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for.</b> Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{portrayed as}} an {{imaginary}} {{character in a}} schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to be real when she arrived to study in Hollyoaks. She was central to a controversial suicide storyline, and {{was part of a}} love triangle with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), which left her pregnant by Ste. She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for being {{one of the few who}} dared to oppose the Hollyoaks villain. Rae was originally characterised as a chav with a feisty persona, but underwent a transformation when she attempted to embrace domestic life with Ste. During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death. Barlow hoped that Rae would <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> her strong-willed nature, and that her exit would be considered one of the best in the programme's history.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool manager Joe Fagan bought Walsh for a £700,000 fee in May 1984. Walsh {{turned down}} an {{approach}} from Italian Serie A side Calcio Como to join Liverpool. He joined Liverpool in time to travel with the players to Rome to see them win the 1984 European Cup Final. He made his debut as a substitute on 18 August 1984 in the 1–0 Charity Shield defeat to derby rivals Everton. With Ian Rush injured {{at the start of}} the 1984–85 season, Walsh partnered Kenny Dalglish up front, and he scored just 14 minutes into his Anfield debut on 27 August in a 3–0 win over West Ham United. However, he picked up a knee injury in October which caused him to miss six weeks and allowed Rush to re-establish himself as Dalglish's preferred strike partner. He scored 13 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions throughout the 1984–85 campaign, the most significant goal being the equaliser in the last minute of extra-time against rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals at Goodison Park. However Liverpool would lose the replay, and also finished as runners-up in the league and European Cup. Walsh started the 1985 European Cup Final against Juventus at Heysell Stadium, but had to come off early in the second half after aggravating a stomach injury; Liverpool lost the game 1–0, though the day would <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> the disaster which cost 39 lives.|$|E

25|$|Gerard's {{research}} was in functional analysis. In recent times his {{research was}} on quantum groups and non-commutative geometry, subjects of importance both for mathematics and physics.

He will also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> his book, , {{which was published}} in 1990 to worldwide acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the racing}} circuit {{occupied}} much of Short's {{time during the}} late {{spring and early summer}} of 1890. The presence of the Shorts at Saratoga Springs, New York, was reported in the local press. While he had enormous success at racetracks across the country, boxing promotion remained an unattainable goal for Short. He was destined to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> gunfights rather than prize fights.|$|E
25|$|During the interregnum, Everton {{reached their}} first League Cup final, with Aston Villa, and the FA Cup Semi final, against Liverpool. In the League Cup Everton and Aston Villa drew the final at Wembley {{and drew the}} replay at Hillsborough, before Everton lost late in extra time of the second replay at Old Trafford. The FA Cup Semi final was drawn 2–2 but the match will forever <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> the goal by Bryan Hamilton that was disallowed. Everton lost the replay 3–0.|$|E

He will also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> his enthusiastic team talks and witty speeches. Northern honoured him by naming the club rugby trophy in Pretoria after him - teams compete for the Lucas Strachan Shield.|$|E
25|$|Boehner {{came into}} {{power on the}} {{momentum}} of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with social conservatives over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 1784 Satchwell {{made the}} {{discovery}} that he would <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for.</b> Until that date {{there was only one}} known spring in Leamington, on land belonging to the 4th Earl of Aylesford, who refused to sell the water (which was used for bathing and medicinal purposes), instead allowing people to have it for free. However in 1784 Satchwell and his friend William Abbotts found a second spring and in the manner of the time used its supposed medicinal qualities to make money from the leisured classes.|$|E
