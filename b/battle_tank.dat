5|$|Croatia {{also has}} a {{significant}} military industry sector which exported around US$120 million worth of military equipment and armament in 2010. Croatian-made weapons and vehicles used by CAF include the standard sidearm HS2000 manufactured by HS Produkt and the M-84D <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> designed by the Đuro Đaković factory. Uniforms and helmets worn by CAF soldiers are also locally produced and successfully marketed to other countries.|$|E

5|$|Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 {{tank gun}} has been {{manufactured}} for other nations. For example, the Leopard 2 {{armed with the}} 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Egypt had manufactured 700–800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005, and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks; their M256 main guns (the US version of the L/44) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal. The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia, while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The American license-built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems {{as part of the}} M60-2000 Main <b>Battle</b> <b>Tank</b> which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a reduced cost, though the company has not yet found a buyer.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main <b>battle</b> <b>tank,</b> the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E
5|$|The Leopard 2E or Leopard 2A6E (E {{stands for}} España, Spanish for Spain) is {{a variant of}} the German Leopard 2 main <b>battle</b> <b>tank,</b> {{tailored}} to the requirements of the Spanish army, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named Programa Coraza, or Program Breastplate. The acquisition program for the Leopard2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July 2002, the {{regiment}} {{was presented with}} its current Standard by the then Governor General, Dr. Peter Hollingworth. On 26 July 2007, after 31 years of service the Leopard was replaced by 59 M1A1 Abrams AIM, with 41 being delivered to {{the regiment}} and the remaining vehicles issued to the School of Armour for use for training purposes. Seven M88A2 Hercules Armoured Recovery Vehicles were also acquired, two being delivered to the regiment. The Leopards never saw operational service, although during the 1999 East Timor crisis the regiment was placed on standby to deploy in the event the conflict escalated, while the regiment was not deployed during Australia's involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Members of the unit later deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as Bushmaster PMV crews, while others have also served in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. During this period the regiment was the only main <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> unit in the Australian Army and was based at Robertson Barracks, in Darwin. Until 2013 it {{provided the basis for}} one of three battlegroups within the mechanised 1st Brigade, which included two mechanised infantry battalions, one cavalry regiment, one tank regiment, and a medium artillery regiment.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Verdeja program's end {{came with}} the arrival of {{military}} equipment from the United States, beginning in 1953. From 1954, the Spanish Army received 389 M47 Patton Tanks, replacing the T-26s, Panzer Is and Panzer IVs then in service. The Verdeja had become completely obsolete when compared to larger, more potent tanks such as the German Panther, the Soviet T-54 and the US M47. The T-54 had 200millimetre of steel armor on the turret mantlet, far greater than the Verdeja 2's maximum armor thickness of 40millimetres. The Soviet 45millimetre model 1932 gun was replaced by the T-34's 76.2millimetre gun, while the Germans adopted the 75millimetre L/70 tank gun on the Panther. By 1950, Soviet tanks such as the T-54 were armed with the D-10T 100millimetre tank gun, and American tanks adopted the 90millimetre main gun. Although the Verdeja was Spain's most successful indigenous design, it was outclassed as foreign countries produced superior products. Furthermore, the need for self-propelled artillery was soon eliminated as the United States offered Spain M37 and M44 self-propelled howitzers. As a result, interest in the Verdeja dried up after 1954. Spain would not attempt another indigenous tank until the advent of the Lince main <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 {{has also}} been {{exported}} widely. Foreign nations which field, or have fielded, the Type 62 include North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of the Congo, Mali, Albania and Sudan. There {{is a lot of}} confusion concerning the North Korean Ch'ŏnma-ho main <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> which is sometimes considered to be an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. This is incorrect as the Ch'ŏnma-ho main <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> is based on the Soviet T-62 main <b>battle</b> <b>tank.</b> This originated from the fact that many times tanks like Type 59 and Type 62 are listed as T-59 and T-62. This leads to many confusions which in turn lead to, for example, listing the Albania as T-62 main <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> operator and calling the Ch'ŏnma-ho main <b>battle</b> <b>tank</b> an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. It's not clear which nations still have them in service, although based on available knowledge it seems that all original users still have it either on active or reserve status except for North Korea which didn't have them in service as of 1995.|$|E
