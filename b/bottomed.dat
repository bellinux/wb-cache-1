5|$|The {{years after}} their {{back-to-back}} championships saw a return to mediocrity for the Argos. Ticket sales remained flat, and there were changes in ownership. Gimmicks to attract fans were greeted with criticism. The Argos seemingly <b>bottomed</b> out in July 2003 when the CFL stripped control over the team from owner Sherwood Schwarz. The team had amassed debts of over $20 million, including $17.4 owed to Schwarz himself.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly <b>bottomed</b> streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave <b>bottomed</b> cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
5|$|Having {{exhausted}} {{most of his}} {{resources in}} Pennsylvania helping establish the new United States government, Captain Rowan decided to move the family to the western frontier, where he hoped to start fresh and rebuild his fortune. On October 10, 1783, the Rowans and five other families embarked on a flat <b>bottomed</b> boat near Redstone Creek and began their journey down the Monongahela River toward the Falls of the Ohio. The travelers expected the journey to last a few days at most, but ice along the river slowed the journey, {{and a lack of}} provisions exacerbated the delays. Three of the families disembarked near what is now Maysville, Kentucky; the Rowans would later learn that most of these settlers were killed by Indians. The remaining settlers continued downriver, reaching Louisville, Kentucky on March 10, 1783.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm drag on Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock <b>bottomed</b> Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E
5|$|The group {{discovered}} U-853 <b>bottomed</b> in , {{and dropped}} depth charges and hedgehogs during a 16-hour attack. At first the U-boat attempted to flee, {{and then tried}} to hide by lying still. Both times it was found by sonar. The morning of 6 May 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from Atherton and Moberly resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface. With the loss of all 55 officers and men, U-853 {{was one of the last}} U-boats sunk during World War II. and, with , the last to be sunk in US waters. Atherton and Moberly received credit for the kill.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round <b>bottomed</b> cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 12th century a new city wall began to be built around Worcester, with work {{probably}} continuing until early the next century. Enclosing about 85 acres (34.4 hectares), its design tracked the flow of natural streams to the north and east, and made use of the castle in the south as part of the defences. The walls were constructed of sandstone, and appear to have been surrounded by a flat <b>bottomed,</b> water-filled ditch, more than 30 feet (9 m) wide. The new walls cut across existing parts of the city and would have required the demolition of numerous existing buildings that lay in their way; the new defences also cut off the outlying districts of Sidbury, Lowesmoore, Foregate Street and The Tything from the inside of the walled city. Three main gates were built in the walls– North Gate, St Martin's Gate and Sidbury Gate– protected by gatehouses of paired circular towers and arrowslits for use by crossbowmen. Smaller gates were built between them, such as Friar's Gate.|$|E
5|$|The northwestern {{slope of}} Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, {{the result of}} the rain shadow effect, as the {{dominant}} trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage {{they have been able to}} capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the summit and left with Wai'ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from the north side of the summit, and as a result is a deep, long, narrow <b>bottomed</b> valley with little habitable floodplain.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism. It {{functions}} as a radio and television broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions. Over 150million people have visited the tower in total since its opening in late 1958. Tower attendance had been steadily declining until it <b>bottomed</b> out at 2.3million in 2000. Since then, attendance has been rising, and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year. The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. Here, visitors can eat, shop and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from {{the first floor of}} FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from {{the second floor of the}} Main Observatory to reach the final observation deckthe Special Observatory.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{returned}} to green flag conditions on lap 26, de Silvestro held the lead ahead of Franchitti, Hunter-Reay and Kanaan with Tagliani in fifth position. De Silvestro {{kept the lead}} for a further two laps, with Hunter-Reay's Andretti Autosport car moving ahead of Franchitti on lap 27, repeating his move on Tagliani on the defending series champion. Not long after, Hunter-Reay moved ahead of de Silvestro as the pair were under braking for turn five. Hunter-Reay nearly lost control of his car as his car <b>bottomed</b> out on the straight, with lifted the car slightly airborne. Franchitti further demoted the young Swiss driver to third, moving ahead on lap 29. Behind them, Hideki Mutoh hit Vitor Meira which saw his retirement from the race, and Wheldon hit the back of Tagliani which sent him into Kanaan, resulting in the retirement of the Canadian driver. Rain started falling once again, more heavily than before {{and much of the}} field pitted to change from dry-weather tyres to wet-weather ones. Alex Lloyd aquaplaned into the wall in the second Dale Coyne car, bringing out the caution for the third time, and with rain falling relentlessly, series officials brought out the red flag to allow the weather conditions to pass. After a 36-minute red flag delay, cars returned to the circuit with slicks being the choice of tyre for the track, despite a few wet patches remaining on the circuit. Some cars gambled on wets thinking that the circuit would not dry quickly enough for their tyres to drop off compared to the slicks.|$|E

25|$|Kamuiyaki {{found in}} the Okinawa Islands are {{characterized}} by their association with white glazed wares, soapstone cauldrons and locally produced earthenwares. These earthenwares, collectively called gusuku wares, were urns, small mouthed jars, wide mouth jars, bowls and dishes. They {{were considered to be}} imitations of exotic goods including Amami's kamuiyaki. According to archaeologist Takanashi Osamu, insufficient supply of exotic goods accounts for the production of gusuku wares. Okinawan archaeologists generally argue that gusuku wares replaced earlier flat <b>bottomed</b> pottery. Ikeda Yoshifumi raised doubts and suspected that flat <b>bottomed</b> pottery and gusuku wares had co-existed in the 11th to 12th centuries. In his hypothesis, gusuku wares represented an external power that took time to assimilate indigenous societies that produced flat <b>bottomed</b> pottery.|$|E
25|$|The Wexford Cot is a flat <b>bottomed</b> boat {{used for}} fishing on the tidal mudflats in Wexford, also a canoe shaped Punt {{fitted with a}} gun, called a Float in Wexford is used {{traditionally}} to shoot game birds in the North Slob mud flats.|$|E
25|$|When {{wearing the}} full <b>bottomed</b> wig, Queen's Counsel {{have a black}} rosette hanging {{from the back of}} the neck, which was {{originally}} intended to catch oil and powder that might otherwise mark the silk gown. Modern wigs, however, are made of horsehair and so there is no longer any oil or powder.|$|E
25|$|Charges of corruption, nepotism, and graft {{aimed at}} Toledo, his family, {{members of his}} {{administration}} and fellow PP members plagued his presidency. These stories led to many resignations and were the most significant reason forToledo's low approval ratings. Those ratings <b>bottomed</b> out in 2004, following the resignation of his Minister of Agriculture.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Shell drilled {{the first}} well off Nova Scotia, the Sable Offshore Energy Project C-67 well. Located on desolate, sandy Sable Island (best {{known for its}} herd of wild horses), the well <b>bottomed</b> in gas-bearing Cretaceous rocks. Drilling stopped there because the {{technology}} did not exist to handle the super-pressures the well encountered.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 1914 Commodore Keyes hoisted {{his broad}} pennant in Lurcher, leading Firedrake, two D-class and six E-class {{submarines}} eastwards into the North Sea. Also at sea were the destroyers of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. The {{plan was to}} place elements of the High Seas Fleet between Royal Navy surface ships and <b>bottomed</b> Royal Navy submarines. Unknown to Keyes and Tyrwhitt, the Admiralty had added significant reinforcements at the last minute.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Type H was, {{like that}} of its predecessors, a single step design. A pair of flat <b>bottomed</b> floats, mounted below the outer interplane struts, {{stabilized}} the aircraft on the water. Two flight crew members were accommodated side-by-side and a front gunner sat separately in the nose. The rounded, finless rudder mounted above the high tailplane distinguished the Type H from earlier FBA flying boats, which had angular vertical tails.|$|E
25|$|The lower wings were {{mounted on}} the top of a flat <b>bottomed,</b> single-stepped hull with flat sides which tapered in profile toward the rear. The wings were further braced to the hull by a pair of struts {{reaching}} back from the nose to the centre wing leading edge. The nose also had raised decking protecting of the pilot, who sat in the front of the open cockpit with a passenger seat behind him.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the decades}} that followed, Sudbury's economy went through {{boom and bust}} cycles as world demand for nickel fluctuated. Demand was high during the First World War, when Sudbury-mined nickel was used {{extensively}} in the manufacturing of artillery in Sheffield, England. It <b>bottomed</b> out {{when the war ended}} and then rose again in the mid-1920s as peacetime uses for nickel began to develop. The town was reincorporated as a city in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The end of Suharto's rule {{brought a}} new President, Jusuf Habibie, to power on 21 May 1998. Little action was seen immediately, and by 17 June the rupiah had <b>bottomed</b> out at 16,800 rupiah per dollar. On 25 June 1998, a fourth Letter of Intent was signed with the IMF, which was refusing to provide aid due to {{breaches}} of its original agreement. The IMF agreed to provide an immediate US$5 billion of aid to cover basic necessities.|$|E
25|$|The end of World War II {{brought about}} a huge plunge in Kaiser Permanente membership; for example, 50,000 workers had left the Northern California yards by July 1945. Membership <b>bottomed</b> out at 17,000 for the entire system but then surged back to 26,000 within six months as Garfield aggressively marketed his plan to the public. Sidney Garfield & Associates had been a sole proprietorship, but in 1948, it was reorganized into a partnership, Permanente Medical Group.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to America in 1984, {{he was hired}} as chef de cuisine at La Reserve in New York, before leaving to open Rakel in early 1987. Rakel's refined French cuisine catered to the expensive tastes of Wall Street executives and received a two-star review from The New York Times. Its popularity waned as the stock market <b>bottomed</b> out {{and at the end}} of the 1980s, Keller left, unwilling to compromise his style of cooking to simple bistro fare.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs {{seemingly}} <b>bottomed</b> out in 1988–89 with {{a record}} of 21–61, the worst in franchise history at the time. However, the 1989–90 season was notable for several reasons. It was the first season of full ownership for Red McCombs, who was an original investor in the team and helped solidify local ownership for the team. Additionally, the 1988–89 season featured the debut of Larry Brown as the Spurs head coach who moved to San Antonio after winning the NCAA National Championship with Kansas in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Trouser width has varied {{considerably}} {{throughout the}} decades. In the 1920s, trousers were straight-legged and wide-legged, {{with a standard}} width at the cuff of 23inches. After 1935, trousers began to be tapered in at {{the bottom half of}} the leg. Trousers remained wide at the top of the leg throughout the 1940s. By the 1950s and 1960s, a more slim look had become popular. In the 1970s, suit makers offered a variety of styles of trousers, including flared, bell <b>bottomed,</b> wide-legged, and more traditional tapered trousers. In the 1980s these styles disappeared in favour of tapered, slim-legged trousers.|$|E
25|$|The hull was double <b>bottomed</b> with a {{capacity}} of 2,270 tons of fresh water for boilers or ship use with trimming tanks in the peaks and three deep tanks, one forward and two aft of the engine room, for a total water ballast of 4,600 tons. There were five complete decks composed of orlop, lower, middle, upper and shelter decks with the strength deck at the shelter deck rather than usual upper deck with ten watertight bulkheads running up to the upper deck. Normal coal capacity was 1,950 tons but that could be increased by use of reserve bunkers to 2,800 tons.|$|E
25|$|Commerce was {{originally}} {{started by the}} town's founder, la Becque, who built canals with locks right up to Lys. The local weavers were able to deliver their bolts of cloth to the port situated in the town centre from {{where they would be}} sent on to the clothes manufacturing town of Armentièrs. The boats used were called martsheps, that is, 'market boats', which were flat <b>bottomed</b> boats. It was by using these boats that local farmers were able to deliver their produce to the neighbouring towns. Boats of this type were used right up until the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{spawning}} stock of North-East Arctic cod {{was more than}} a million tons following World War II, but declined to a historic minimum of 118,000 tons in 1987. The North-East Arctic cod catch reached a historic maximum of 1,343,000 tons in 1956, and <b>bottomed</b> out at 212,000 tons in 1990. Since 2000, the {{spawning stock}} has increased quite quickly, helped by low fishing pressure. However, there are worries about a decreased age at first spawning (often an early sign of stock collapse), combined with the level of discards and unreported catches. The total catch in 2003 was 521,949 tons, the major fishers being Norway (191,976 tons) and Russia (182,160 tons).|$|E
25|$|Grandpa Type A Nambus have {{multiple}} variances from the later Type A Modified. The Type A Modified, {{commonly referred to}} as Papa Nambu, were produced at the Tokyo Arsenal until the 7000 serial number range. The trigger guard of the Grandpa Type A Nambu were considered extremely cramped especially when wearing gloves and were enlarged in later produced models. The Grandpa Nambus also had a wooden bottom magazine and welded lanyard loops. Papa Nambus had aluminum <b>bottomed</b> magazines with lanyard loops retained in rings. Both the Grandpa and Papa type Nambus may have the Siamese juk symbol stamped on the rear grip indicating service in Thailand before World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Finland {{fell into}} a {{depression}} caused {{by a combination of}} economic overheating, fixed currency, depressed Western, Soviet, and local markets. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. The growth in the 1980s was based on debt and defaults started rolling in. GDP declined by 15% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled to cut spending and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Some 7–8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing banks and force banking sector consolidation. After devaluations the depression <b>bottomed</b> out in 1993.|$|E
25|$|By the 1979–1980 season, the network's NBA ratings had <b>bottomed,</b> with {{a regular}} season rating for the {{broadcasts}} at 6.4. By this time, the network had eliminated its regional coverage and only used two play-by-play announcers (Brent Musburger and Gary Bender) and three color commentators (Bill Russell and Rod Hundley, who teamed with Musburger and Rick Barry, who teamed with Bender); CBS felt that showing an NBA Finals game was not worth pre-empting their Friday night lineup (the smash hit Dallas in particular) during May sweeps (although the iconic episode in which J.R. Ewing was shot aired on March 21, 1980, and Dallas was already in summer reruns). The consensus was that a basketball game in prime time would have drawn fewer viewers. As a result, CBS used to regularly run NBA games in the 11:30p.m. time slot (then occupied by The CBS Late Movie). For the 1980 and 1981 NBA Finals, CBS scheduled Games 3 and 4 on back-to-back days (Saturday and Sunday) to avoid an extra tape delay game.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of the American political system. This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials <b>bottomed</b> out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{brilliant}} season in 1864 {{when the team}} won eight and drew three of its eleven first-class matches, Surrey went into free-fall {{in the latter half}} of the 1860s, owing to the decline of key players Caesar, Stephenson and Mortlock and a puzzling inability to find quality bowlers to support the incomparable James Southerton, whose combination with wicket-keeper Ted Pooley virtually carried the team. Although Southerton broke many bowling records and Harry Jupp developed into the most prolific scorer among professional batsmen, Surrey’s record in purely county matches during the seventeen seasons from 1866 to 1882 was 59 victories, 107 losses, two ties and 37 drawn games. The team <b>bottomed</b> out in 1871 when they did not win a single county match for the only time until 2008. Southerton, except in 1872 when fast bowler James Street helped him to win seven of twelve games, had no adequate support in bowling after underarm left-arm spinner George Griffith declined, and except when Richard Humphrey achieved prominence in 1872 the batting depended almost entirely on Jupp. The fielding was also generally below the standard expected of first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1979–80 season, the Whalers {{had many}} aging {{veterans}} {{left over from}} their WHA days. To make matters worse, the Whalers reputation of making disastrous trades began to unfold, as the team began to trade away stars for mediocre players {{in an attempt to}} gain depth. For instance, they traded star defenseman Mark Howe and their first NHL scoring leader, Mike Rogers, in separate deals for players and draft picks which never panned out, and also swapped defensive-defenseman Gordie Roberts, who would go on to play 15 remaining professional seasons, for the remaining half-season of Mike Fidler's NHL career. The Whalers <b>bottomed</b> out in the 1982–83 season with a record of 19–54–7 (45 points), ranked 20th out of 21 teams in the NHL standings. On May 2, 1983, the Whalers hired Emile Francis as their new general manager to rebuild the team. About two months later, on July 7, Francis hired Jack Evans to be the Whalers' new head coach. By the end of the 1986–87 season, Francis had cut or traded away every player from the 1982–83 Whalers' roster save for Ron Francis, Paul MacDermid, and Greg Millen.|$|E
25|$|In 1818, {{fed up with}} {{sporadic}} and unreliable deliveries by the Lehigh Coal Mining Company, several Philadelphia foundry owners (led by two {{known for}} high tech thinking) combined and leased the mining rights and took over management of LCMC. Within months they'd also formed the Lehigh Navigation Company' (LCN) to build Navigations up the Lehigh {{to a place where}} barges, not just cargo boats could be loaded with greater coal productionand more importantly, the several rapids which swallowed many a coal boat in the prior decade could be tamed. This early 1818 plan would put coal within 12 miles of a reliable water transport route to Philadelphia, and the Lehigh Navigation Company (LCN)'s had no trouble recruiting workers nor raising money to make the lower Lehigh Canalup to the southern mouth of the Lehigh Gorge. The project would also inspire other canal works such as the Erie and Morris, Pennsylvania, and Delaware & Hudson canals. By 1820 the dams and locks of all the downstream navigations were in place up to the confluence of the river and Nesquehoning Creek near the mouth of the Gorge at the flats below Mount Pisgah between Mauch Chunk and Nesquehoninga great bending flat <b>bottomed</b> former lake bed between steep sided valley walls. Hence LC had tamed the lower river and a mule road was operating reliably enough to deliver coal in a timely manner from Summit Hill and new mines being dug at what are now Lansford and Coaldale.|$|E
