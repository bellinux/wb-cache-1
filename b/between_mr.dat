However the peace was broken again when some British troops misbehaved with Shaista Khan’s troops in Hooghly on 28 October 1686 for which the former were severely beaten by the latter. At the same time the admiral opened fire and burnt down 500 houses; property losses were about thirty lacs of rupees.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage <b>between</b> <b>Mr.</b> Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E
25|$|While {{the main}} event saw two of CMLL's top Rudo factions face off as La Peste Negra faced off against Los Invasores, the storyline {{centered}} more around the building rivalry <b>between</b> <b>Mr.</b> Niebla of La Peste Negra and Volador Jr. of Los Invasores. At the previous week's Super Viernes the two had teamed up, but due to infighting between the two their team lost the match. Mr. Niebla allied himself with El Felino and Negro Casas while Volador Jr. teamed up with Mr. Águila and Psicosis, pitting two experienced teams against each other. La Peste Negra took the first fall, while Los Invasores cheated their way to taking the second fall. During the third fall Mr. Niebla began tearing Volador Jr.'s super hero inspired outfit apart, almost stripping Volador Jr. of his shirt as well as tearing at Volador Jr.'s mask. After {{a long period of}} the advantage switching {{back and forth between the}} two teams La Peste Negra distracted the referee, allowing Mr. Niebla to use an illegal low blow on Volador Jr. and pin him for the third and final fall. After the match an enraged Volador Jr. openly challenged Mr. Niebla to aLucha de Apuestas match where both wrestlers would risk their Masks. Like the previous week Mr. Niebla declined the challenge at that point in time.|$|E
