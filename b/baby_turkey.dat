50|$|Dawkins {{goes on to}} {{illustrate}} his point by demonstrating how scientists {{have been able to}} fool creatures big and small using seemingly dumb triggers. For instance, stickleback fish treat a pear-shape as a sex bomb (a supernormal stimulus). Gulls' hard-wired instincts make them reach over and roll back not just their own stray eggs, but also wooden cylinders and cocoa tins. Honeybees push out their live and protesting companion from their hive, when the companion is painted with a drop of oleic acid. Furthermore, a turkey will kill anything which moves in its nest unless it cries like a <b>baby</b> <b>turkey.</b> If the turkey is deaf, it will mercilessly kill its own babies.|$|E

5000|$|The farm is on {{approximately}} 900 acre of {{land and}} raises free-range turkeys (about 60,000 in 2008) under pecan trees on about 30 of those acres. The farm purchases poults (<b>baby</b> <b>turkeys)</b> from a hatchery in Oakwood, Ohio. The turkeys are fed a diet of [...] "freshly ground corn, oats and soybean meal, along with some vitamins" [...] and each [...] "needs 70 pounds of grain to reach slaughter size". The Bates Farm services customers {{from a wide range}} of locations, including many that are far-flung, including California, Oregon, and Alaska. Because it is cheaper to raise turkeys in the Mid-West, nearer where the grain they eat is grown, other turkey farms in the state have gone out of business, leaving Bates as the sole remaining in Alabama, which once had 150 turkey growers. Turkey prices are highly dependent on feed costs—in 2011 Bates had to double his prices after corn got more expensive.|$|R
50|$|Swaddling {{still is}} {{distributed}} worldwide. In some countries, swaddling {{is the standard}} treatment of <b>babies.</b> In <b>Turkey</b> for instance, 93.1% of all babies become swaddled in the traditional way. According to the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), 39% of all documented contemporary non-industrialized cultures show swaddling practices; further 19% use other methods of movement restriction for infants. Some authors assume that the popularity of swaddling is growing in the U.S., Great Britain and the Netherlands. A British sample showed up 19.4% of the babies are swaddled at night. In Germany, swaddling is not used as routine care measure and experiences relatively little acceptance, as the missing mentioning of this practice in the standard work on regulatory disturbances of Papusek shows.|$|R
