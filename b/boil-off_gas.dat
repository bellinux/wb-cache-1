40|$|A {{document}} {{presents a}} concept for relatively inexpensive delivery of propellant {{to a large}} fuel depot in low orbit around the Earth, for use in rockets destined for higher orbits, the Moon, and for remote planets. The propellant {{is expected to be}} at least 85 percent of the mass needed in low Earth orbit to support the NASA Exploration Vision. The concept calls for the use of many small (10 ton) spin-stabilized, multistage, solid-fuel rockets to each deliver 250 kg of propellant. Each rocket would be winched up to a balloon tethered above most of the atmospheric mass (optimal altitude 26 2 km). There, the rocket would be aimed slightly above the horizon, spun, dropped, and fired at a time chosen so that the rocket would arrive in orbit near the depot. Small thrusters on the payload (powered, for example, by <b>boil-off</b> <b>gases</b> from cryogenic propellants that make up the payload) would precess the spinning rocket, using data from a low-cost inertial sensor to correct for small aerodynamic and solid rocket nozzle misalignment torques on the spinning rocket; would manage the angle of attack and the final orbit insertion burn; and would be fired on command from the depot in response to observations of the trajectory of the payload so as to make small corrections to bring the payload into a rendezvous orbit and despin it for capture by the depot. The system is low-cost because the small rockets can be mass-produced using the same techniques as those to produce automobiles and low-cost munitions, and one or more can be launched from a U. S. territory on the equator (Baker or Jarvis Islands in the mid-Pacific) to the fuel depot on each orbit (every 90 minutes, e. g., any multiple of 6, 000 per year) ...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis project aims to {{investigate}} the circumstances of boil-off for heavy vehicle transports, using LNG as fuel, and suggest possible ways of handling these gases otherwise released into the atmosphere. LNG, Liquefied Natural Gas, is when natural gas is cooled below its vaporisation point, turning it into liquid phase which {{is a much more}} dense way of storing and transporting the fuel. Trucks running on LNG store their fuel in super insulated tanks, but some heat are transferred to the fuel anyway, causing it to vaporise at a steady rate. During driving of these trucks, this vaporised gas is consumed and the pressure are kept at a certain level of 10 bar. Once the truck is turned off, consumption stops and the pressure starts to increase. After a period of standstill, normally several days, the pressure within the tank has increased to 16 bar where a valve opens to release gas from the tank. This is a safety feature, causing the pressure not to increase further creating hazards. While natural gas, mostly containing methane, is released, fuel is lost and an environmentally unfriendly substance is let out into the atmosphere. This should be avoided, to improve the environmental aspects of using LNG as a fuel for trucks, which most likely will be regulated by laws yet to come. Since the release of <b>boil-off</b> <b>gases</b> rarely should happen during the regular use of these trucks, but a system handling these gases should work at any time and place, a cheap and lightweight unit are to be fitted to these trucks. Equipment already on the truck should be used as much as possible, keeping additional costs and weight low. The only practical way of storing this gas, which is the most resource efficient way of handling these <b>boil-off</b> <b>gases,</b> is to re-liquefy it and transferring it back to the usual LNG tank on the vehicle. The second best option is to consume the gas, making it less environmentally unfriendly. While consuming the gas, as much as possible of its energy should be utilised as electricity and heat. Preferably, electricity should be produced as much as possible, charging the batteries on the truck, decreasing the fuel consumption while running and increasing the lifespan of the batteries. The most efficient way of managing the heat generated is to distribute it to the coolant system on the truck, providing it to the engine and several other components. Distributing the energy is also a matter of safety, as very hot areas otherwise might cause risks of fire. The most simple concept, that is easiest to implement in the near future, is to use a burner similar to the auxiliary diesel heaters fitted to some trucks today. This consumes fuel, generating heat to the coolant system. An additional cooler is needed, to cool of excess heat from the system keeping the temperatures to a certain level. Using this system for an extensive period of time needs an external power supply, since no electricity is generated from consuming the gas. Other technologies {{that could be used in}} the future, also generating electricity, is thermoelectric generators and solid oxide fuel cells. These are technologies now being further developed and adapted to the industry of vehicles. These technologies are especially interesting when they are implemented to these trucks for use within other systems as well, for instance utilisation of the heat within exhaust gases. A small scale re-liquefaction unit mounted to the truck is however seen as the most resource efficient solution, making it possible to keep using the gas for it intended purpose of propelling the trucks forward. This technology has to be made more compact, adapting it to the use on a truck...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. A {{need was}} {{identified}} to test multi–layer vacuum super insulation (MLVSI) used in cryogenic applications for hydrogen storage. The study {{focuses on the}} application of commercially available MLVSI to a locally patented liquid hydrogen cryogenic storage system. This led to an investigation {{of different types of}} multi–layer vacuum insulation configurations, as well as further research on tank inlet coupling configurations. It includes the manufacturing of a liquid nitrogen testing cryostat to be able to test and evaluate the system performance. The first set of tests was based on the development of an inlet coupling configuration to limit heat transfer through the inner tank inlet, of a double cryogenic tank system in order to reduce <b>gas</b> <b>boil–off.</b> The couplings were manufactured {{in the form of a}} bellow to handle cryogenic vacuum levels, while ensuring low heat transfer rates between inner and outer tanks. It was found that various coupling designs can be considered to limit <b>gas</b> <b>boil–off.</b> The second set of tests was conducted on a specific MLVSI configuration to determine its effectiveness to insulate the spherical header surface of a typical hydrogen storage vessel. The installation procedure, to limit heat transfer and boil–off due to edge effects in this configuration was investigated. It was found that insulation–overlap–edge effects will always have an impact on insulation performance when a spherical header of a storage vessel is insulated, due to its specific geometry. A time efficient way to install MLVSI on such a spherical header is presented and evaluated. Further investigations were carried out by combining findings into one single system to determine the performance of an optimised insulated cryogenic system. It was found that copper plate discs installed between the vanes of a bellowed inlet/outlet nozzle is the most promising to limit heat transfer to the cryogenic fluid. Master...|$|R
5000|$|A marine LNG {{engine is}} a {{dual fuel engine}} that uses natural gas and bunker fuel to convert {{chemical}} energy in to mechanical energy. Due to natural gas’ cleaner burning properties, the use of natural gas in merchant ship propulsion plants is becoming an option for companies in order to comply with IMO and MARPOL environmental regulations. The natural gas is stored in liquid state (LNG) and the <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> is routed to and burned in dual fuel engines. [...] Shipping companies have been cautious when choosing a propulsion system for their fleets. The steam turbine system has been the main choice as the prime mover on LNG carriers {{over the last several}} decades. The decades old system on steam propelled LNG carriers uses BOG (<b>boil-off</b> <b>gas).</b> LNG carriers are heavily insulated to keep the LNG at around -160 °C - to keep it liquefied. What happens is that even with all the insulation, the LNG containment area is penetrated by heat which allows for naturally generated <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> (BOG).|$|E
50|$|Eye {{protection}} is required {{at all times}} when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas,</b> use of a full face shield is recommended.|$|E

50|$|The vessel can now {{proceed to}} the {{discharge}} port. During passage various boil-off management strategies can be used. <b>Boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> can be burned in boilers to provide steam for propulsion, {{or it can be}} re-liquefied and returned to the cargo tanks, depending on the design of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|Overall, it is {{estimated}} that Q-Max carriers have about 40% lower energy requirements and carbon emissions than conventional LNG carriers. The quoted estimates do however ignore the additional fuel used to re-liquify boil off gas rather than burn the gas for fuel.

50|$|The {{two common}} types of LNG {{carriers}} are Moss and Membrane. Moss type carriers feature spherical tanks to hold LNG, while Membrane style carriers feature more traditional rectangular style tanks with a stainless-steel membrane.

50|$|Designed by Gaz Transport, {{the tanks}} {{consists}} of a primary and secondary thin membrane made of the material Invar which has almost no thermal contraction. The insulation {{is made out of}} plywood boxes filled with perlite and continuously flushed with nitrogen gas. The integrity of both membranes is permanently monitored by detection of hydrocarbon in the nitrogen. An evolution is proposed by NG2, with the replacement of nitrogen by argon as the flushed inert and insulation gas. Argon has a better insulation power than nitrogen, which could save 10% of <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{higher cost}} of {{turbines}} {{and the associated}} gears or generator/motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power, although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency. To reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years. Today, propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50%, yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50%, especially in marine applications. Diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required. Thus, conventional steam power is used in very few new ships. An exception is LNG carriers which often find it more economical to use <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it.|$|E

50|$|Phase 3 was {{announced}} in May 2007 to increase storage, ship unloading and vapourisation capabilities. A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed {{to the east of}} the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing transfer pipeline. The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch vapour return arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch recirculation line. Additional facilities included further submerged combustion vapourisers; <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a vent stack. The development provided an additional five million tonnes of capacity per annum. All this capacity was contracted out from December 2010. Customers included BP, Iberdrola, Sonatrach, Centrica, E.ON and GDF Suez.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{propulsion}} systems in LNG carriers use the BOG and liquid fuels. In a steam plant, the BOG {{is used to}} fire the boilers and produce steam. The steam drives the turbines and propels the ship. The advantage to this type {{is that when the}} LNG cargo tank pressure is elevated the excessive BOG is burned simultaneously with liquid fuel. If there isn’t enough BOG, liquid fuel (heavy fuel oil or HFO) is used to keep the plant operating. [...] An alternative to the steam turbine engine is the dual-fuel marine diesel engine. Commercial ship propulsion system manufacturers such as Finland’s Wartsila and Germany’s MAN Diesel SE are producing large bore dual-fuel diesel engines. The MAN B&W ME-GI Engines have extremely flexible fuel modes that range from 95% natural gas to 100% HFO and anywhere in between. A minimum of 5% HFO for pilot oil is required as these are compression ignition engines and natural gas is not self-combustible. Steam turbines are exclusively the primary moving source for LNG ships, even though 2-stroke diesel engines are more efficient. This is because the <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> from LNG needs to be utilized.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural gas}} that fuels dual fuel engines {{is carried on}} ships as a boiling liquid, and transported at {{slightly}} higher than atmospheric pressure. When tank insulation is penetrated by any influx in heat, it will cause {{the temperature of the}} liquefied natural gas to rise, which allows for vaporization from liquid to gas. When heat penetrates the tank, the tank’s pressure increases due to boil-off. The insulation of the tanks is designed with the most advanced technology. Even still, the insulation of the tanks is penetrated by heat. The boil-off occurs during the ships voyage. During a storm, the LNG cargo moves and sloshes around in the tanks. The <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> represents 0.1% - 0.25% of the ships capacity per day. Tanks need to be maintained at a steady pressure. If the pressure in tanks is not controlled relief or safety valves are forced to open, venting the boil-off into the atmosphere until pressure is relieved. At this point, it has been proven that on board LNG re-liquefaction is uneconomical for most ships. Instead, the gas produced by this boil-off effect is routed to the ship’s propulsion system and used as fuel for power plants such as steam boilers and dual fuel marine diesel engines. This reduces the use of bunker fuel, reducing fuel costs and equipment maintenance costs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} evaporation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) occurring at different places in the LNG supply chain. Evaporation losses in the LNG supply chain {{are one of the}} key factors for LNG safety, technical and economic assessment. LNG is stored and transported in tanks as a cryogenic liquid, i. e. as a liquid at a temperature below its boiling point at near atmospheric pressure. Due to heat entering the cryogenic tank during storage and transportation, a part of the LNG in the tank continuously evaporates creating a gas called <b>Boil-Off</b> <b>Gas</b> (BOG), which changes the quality of LNG over time. The general methods of handling and utilization of the <b>Boil-Off</b> <b>Gas</b> at different points in the LNG supply chain are presented.

30|$|The {{transition}} from steam to internal combustion diesel engines was made around 1925, {{at the peak}} of steamer shipping. The change was prompted by the operational simplicity, robustness and fuel economy of the diesel engines. By the early 1950 s, diesel ships held over 50  % market share. Any switch to LNG-powered vessels is unlikely to induce a similarly dramatic decline in steamer shipping as the introduction of steam caused in sail shipping, across all market segments, since LNG-powered carriers continue also to be fitted with steam turbines, allowing <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> to be used for steam production.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{transport}} of natural gas, predominately {{in the form}} of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), is of growing importance in the global energy markets. LNG is transported with vessels having cryogenic tanks without any means of external refrigeration. Hence, a significant fraction of the cargo LNG volume evaporates during voyage, which is usually called <b>Boil-Off</b> <b>Gas</b> (BOG). According to the type of the energy system, BOG can be utilized as fuel, reliquefied or burned in an oxidizer. The handling of the <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> during the LNG vessel operation and the assessment of its thermodynamic properties are key issues in the technical and economic assessment of the complete marine energy systems of LNG vessels. A detailed dynamic boil-off model has been developed, which accounts for the variation of BOG mass flow, composition and thermodynamic properties during voyage. The model employs coupled non-linear vapor - liquid phase equilibrium thermodynamic equations and differential conservation equations describing the evolution of LNG quantity and composition with time. Various solution and time discretization schemes have been tested to assess the solution accuracy and stability. The model has been used to investigate the variation of the LNG and BOG quantity, composition and thermodynamic properties during typical voyage profiles of a case study LNG vessel.

40|$|Weathering {{occurs in}} stored {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) due to {{the removal of the}} <b>boil-off</b> <b>gas</b> (BOG) from the LNG container and results in the remaining LNG being richer in heavier components. A model has been developed to predict stored LNG weathering in containment tanks, typically used in regasification.
