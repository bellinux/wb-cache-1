5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her <b>blood</b> <b>values</b> were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Hans Michael Holczer, {{the team}} boss of Gerolsteiner in 2005, {{said that the}} UCI had {{informed}} him that Leipheimer had shown <b>blood</b> <b>values</b> just under the doping limit, and that Holczer suspected that Leipheimer was doping. The UCI advised Gerolsteiner to find a reason to remove Leipheimer from the race, but Holczer refused, because his team was still facing bad publicity from a previous doping case.|$|E

The protocol involved an equation in which the hourly <b>blood</b> glucose <b>value</b> and an adjusted multiplier {{were used to determine}} the insulin infusion rate. The default target blood glucose range was 90 to 120 mg/dL. Results showed that <b>blood</b> glucose <b>values</b> taken by diabetic fingerstick were significantly better in March 2006, after initiation of the protocol, than in March 2005, before use of the protocol, for the percentage of patients both with a <b>blood</b> glucose <b>value</b> > 150 mg/dL (P 120 mg/dL (P 0. 10). The increased number of diabetic fingerstick values within a desired range was achieved without a significantly higher number of <b>blood</b> glucose <b>values</b> ≤ 80 mg/dL. It can be theorized that wide use of the protocol was at least partly responsible for the significant change in <b>blood</b> glucose <b>values...</b>|$|R
500|$|Five {{days before}} the start of the 2010 Giro d'Italia, 2009 podium {{finisher}} Pellizotti was identified as a rider of interest to the UCI's biological passport program due to irregular <b>blood</b> <b>values.</b> He was removed from his team's start list for the Giro and provisionally suspended. The UCI asked that CONI open disciplinary proceedings against him, which had no resolution until after the 2010 season finished. TNA cleared him on 21 October and declared him free to race, at which time the Liquigas team intended to re-sign him. The UCI decided in January 2011 to appeal his case to the CAS. The hearing was held in March, and Pellizotti asked for a quick resolution, with plans to return with [...] in the 2011 Tirreno–Adriatico if he were cleared. The court reached its decision after five days, upholding the UCI's appeal, handing Pellizotti a two-year ban, and stripping all his results from this Giro and the 2009 Tour de France. Consequently, Pellizotti has said he is quitting the sport.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, Leipheimer {{was accused}} of having suspect <b>blood</b> <b>values</b> during the 2005 Tour de France by Hans-Michael Holczer, his former team manager at Gerolsteiner, in his book Garantiert Positiv (Guaranteed Positive, in English). [...] According to Holczer, Leipheimer showed <b>blood</b> <b>values</b> that {{indicated}} a [...] "high probability of blood manipulation" [...] and were so suspicious that one UCI official suggested {{that he should be}} withdrawn from the race.

2500|$|Armstrong was {{stripped}} of all his professional results from August 1998 to August 2012, including his seven Tour titles on October 22, 2012. Armstrong's finish in the 2010 Tour—originally 23rd; 22nd {{at the time of}} its stripping—was also stripped. In January 2013, Armstrong admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Although he admitted to have doped in his seven wins, he denied doping in the 2009 and 2010 Tours. Regardless, Armstrong {{was stripped}} of his finishes in those two Tours as well, because his <b>blood</b> <b>values</b> indicated that he doped.

40|$|In {{spite of}} age and <b>blood</b> {{pressure}} <b>values</b> at rest,hypertensive response to moderate intensity stress testingis characterized by increasing ofprobable beginning of cardiac infarction, stroke or coronary disease in 1. 36 times. The hypertensive response to stress test in people with normal <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> at rest (independent of other risk factors) is characterized by increasing risk of future hypertension more than in 2 times. Antihypertensive drugs affect <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> differently during the stress testing. The prognosis of <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> during daily physical activity is necessary for antihypertensive treatment. Low availability of convenient instruments and methodological tools for continuous measurement of blood pressure (similar to Spiroarteriocardiorhythmograph, Finapres) duringthe dosed physical loads constrain wide use of stress tests with controlled blood pressure in medical practice...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Evaluation {{of blood}} {{pressure}} {{in the first year}} of life in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency. METHODS: Twenty-four children were included. Retrospective <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values,</b> fludrocortisone dosages, and serum renin, 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OHP) and androstenedione levels {{in the first year of}} life were evaluated. <b>Blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> were compared to reference <b>values.</b> Correlations between <b>blood</b> pressures and serum renin levels, and the dosage of fludrocortisone were calculated. RESULTS: Mean peak systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> were generally not elevated, most values were around the 50 th percentile, except incidentally higher mean peak systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> most below the 95 th percentile. No significant correlations between blood pressure and serum renin, androstenedione and 17 -OHP levels and fludrocortisone dosage were found. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study in CAH patients, <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> do not seem to be elevated in the first year of life. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate {{blood pressure in}} the first year of life in CAH patients in more detail...|$|R

40|$|The oscillometric {{method and}} Korotkoff sound method {{are the most}} common ways to measure the blood pressure. A new {{automatic}} blood pressure measurement device, which uses both oscillometric method and Korotkoff method, was developed. A pressure sensor was used to obtain cuff pressure and oscillation signal, and a microphone was used to detect Korotkoff sounds. Forty-five measurements from fifteen subjects were used for analysis. Correlation coefficients between the traditional auscultatory method and Korotkoff sound method were 0. 9820 and 0. 9721 for the systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values,</b> respectively. Standard deviations of differences for the systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values</b> were 1. 3019 and 1. 4495, respectively. Correspondingly, correlation coefficients between the traditional auscultatory method and oscillometric method using newly developed algorithm were 0. 9651 and 0. 9136 for the systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values,</b> with the standard deviations of 1. 42 and 1. 73, respectively. The results showed that the newly developed algorithm for oscillometirc method provide accurate <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values,</b> moreover, Korotkoff sound method using microphone provides even higher accuracy. Therefore, a new automatic device which utilizes both oscillometric method and Korotkoff sound method would provide the accurate and reliable <b>blood</b> pressure <b>values...</b>|$|R
