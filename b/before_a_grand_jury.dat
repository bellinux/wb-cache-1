5|$|After {{he testified}} <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted {{when the case}} went to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, {{and was sentenced to}} six months in prison.|$|E

5|$|While the House Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} {{ended in}} a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but {{with a handful of}} Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is <b>a</b> {{legal body}} {{empowered}} to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. <b>A</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> may compel {{the production of}} documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear <b>before</b> it. <b>A</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.|$|R

25|$|If {{the magistrates}} at this local level were {{satisfied}} that the complaint was well-founded, the prisoner was handed over {{to be dealt with}} by a superior court. In 1692, the magistrates opted to wait for the arrival of the new charter and governor, who would establish a Court of Oyer and Terminer to handle these cases. The next step, at the superior court level, was to summon witnesses <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E
25|$|Paul Branzburg of The (Louisville) Courier-Journal, in {{the course}} of his {{reporting}} duties, witnessed people manufacturing and using hashish. He wrote two articles concerning drug use in Kentucky. The first featured unidentified hands holding hashish, while the second included marijuana users as sources.

Branzburg was subpoenaed <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> for both of the articles. He was ordered to name his sources.|$|E
25|$|This case {{involved}} the second prosecution of Webster Hubbell by the Independent Counsel.

50|$|In Ex parte Robinson (1873), on a {{petition}} for a writ of mandamus, the Court held that fines and imprisonment {{are the only}} punishments authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789 for contempt of court.

25|$|Carey contended he {{knew nothing}} of the {{donation}} kickback scheme. He {{said that he had}} approved the large political donations to Citizen Action, the AFL-CIO, and other groups, but that he had relied too heavily on the advice of his aides and did not notice that the donations were much larger than in the past or were being made to some groups the Teamsters did not have long-standing relationships with. He testified <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in August and October 1997 that {{he knew nothing}} of the kickbacks, only the donations.|$|E
25|$|In January 1968, Garrison subpoenaed Kerry Wendell Thornley – an {{acquaintance}} of Oswald's from their days in the military – to appear <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> questioning him {{about his relationship with}} Oswald and his knowledge of other figures Garrison believed to be connected to the assassination. Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court. Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in any manner since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison's successor Harry Connick Sr.|$|E
25|$|He {{was indicted}} in February 2003 on 17 counts under the Patriot Act. A jury acquitted him on 8 counts and deadlocked on the {{remaining}} 9 counts.

However, as his release date approached, a federal prosecutor in Virginia demanded he testify <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in a separate case, which he refused to do, claiming it would violate his plea deal. He was held under house arrest in Northern Virginia from 2008 until 2014 when federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss charges against him.|$|E
