5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their putting trust in women, he mocks them <b>because</b> <b>of</b> how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the impact of previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E
