50|$|The blackbelly rosefish, Helicolenus dactylopterus, is {{a marine}} bony {{fish from the}} family Sebastidae, also known as <b>bluemouth</b> <b>rockfish,</b> and bluemouth seaperch. This Atlantic species is a typical sit-and-wait {{predator}} with a highly cryptic coloration.|$|E
40|$|The {{females of}} the <b>bluemouth</b> <b>rockfish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus (DelaRoche, 1809), store sperm within their ovaries for periods {{of up to}} 10 months. Twenty six females with {{standard}} lengths between 152 and 257 mm and six males with standard lengths between 253 and 209 mm were caught storage crypts with stored spermatozoa and to describe their evolution over the year. After internal fertilization and once sperm reaches the ovary, a crypt forms probably by an epithelial inclusion {{at the base of}} the lamellae of one or several spermatozoa groups that are floating freely in the interlamellar space of the ovarian lumen. Stored spermatozoa have a large cytoplasm bag surrounding their heads. This bag could serve as a nutritive reservoir during the long storage period. Many desmosonal and tight junctions between the crypt cells ensure tha male sex cells are protected against the female immune systemL'emmagatzematge d'esperma en la fertilitzaci√≥ de l'Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopteru...|$|E
40|$|The {{selectivity}} of four hook sizes (STELL brand(1), Quality 2335, numbers 12, 9, 6 and 4) {{used in a}} semi-pelagic longline fishery was {{studied in}} the Azores. Two species were caught in sufficient numbers for modelling of selectivity: the black spot sea bream (Pagellus bogaraveo) and the <b>bluemouth</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus). A maximum likelihood method was used to fit a versatile model {{which can be used}} to describe a wide range of selectivity curves; from bell-shaped to asymptotic. Significant differences in size selectivity between hooks were found for both species. In the case of Pagellus bogaraveo, the smallest hook (number 12) had the lowest catch rates and all hooks were characterised by logistic-type selectivity curves, with sizes at 50 % selectivity of: 27. 9, 30. 4, and 32. 8 cm for hooks numbers 12, 9 and 6, respectively. The number 9 hook was the most efficient for Helicolenus d. dactylopterus, with selectivity curves varying from strongly skewed to the right for the number 12 hook to logistic-type for the numbers 6 and 4 hooks. Sizes at 50 % selectivity for this species were 16. 8, 18. 7, 20. 7, and 22. 0 cm. respectively. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A 2 -year {{study of}} the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) semi-pelagic ("pedra-bola) {{longline}} fishery {{was carried out in}} the Algarve (southern Portugal). This fishery takes place on the continental slope at 200 - 700 m depths. using monofilament longlines that are lifted off the bottom at regular intervals by glass balls. Hook selectivity trials were carried out with four hook sizes (SIAPAL brand numbers 10, 9, 7 and 5) from March to August 1997 and May to August 1998. At least 32 species of fish and invertebrates were caught, with hake dominating the catch (41 and 45 % of the catch in numbers), followed by Galeus melastomus (23 and 19 %), Micromesistius poutassou (10 and 7 %), Benthodesmus elongatus (8 and 5 %), Etmopterus pusillus (6 and 9 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (5 and 4 %). Apart from the hake, and some species of commercial value such as G. melastomus (only the large individuals), Ray's bream (Brama brama, 1. 4 and 4 %), silver scabbard fish (Lepidopus caudatus. 1 and 2. 5 %), swordfish (Xiphins gladius, < 1 %), wreckfish (Polyprion americanus, < 1 %). conger eel (Conger conger. < 1 %), and <b>bluemouth</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Helicolenus dactylopterus, < 1 %) - most of the other species are discarded, used as bait in traps or consumed by the fishermen. Catch rates (number of fish per 100 hooks) for hake and for all species combined decreased significantly with hook size. Hake catch size frequency distributions for the different hook sizes in 1997 and 1998 were highly overlapped, with the four different hooks catching a wide range of sizes. Although catch size frequency distributions for the different sized hooks were not significantly different in 1997, hake caught in 1998 were characterised by smaller sizes and size ranges.
