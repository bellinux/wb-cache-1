50|$|Synchromesh {{transmission}} {{was introduced}} by Cadillac in 1928. If the dog teeth {{make contact with the}} gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or synchromesh, which consists of a cone clutch and <b>blocking</b> <b>ring.</b> Before the teeth can engage, the cone clutch engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a blocker (or baulk) ring. When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|General Motors {{provided}} a fix for [...] "Noise #1" [...] but stated that [...] "Noise #2" [...] was {{a characteristic of}} any car equipped with a manual transmission and that a similar noise could be repeated by lugging the engine. The remedy for [...] "Noise #1" [...] was to overfill the transmission with Saturn Manual Transmission Lubricant from the stock 1.8 quarts to 2.6 quarts. Although this seemed to work for many customers, many other complaints still surfaced and in 2003 General Motors released another TSB urging customers that still have the rattling noise in their transmissions should bring their vehicles in to their nearest General Motors affiliated dealer for a more complex fix. This time, GM Technicians had concluded that gears one and two required additional thrust loads and proceeded to install a wave washer between the <b>blocking</b> <b>ring</b> and speed gears for gears three and four. This indeed fixed the rattle issue once and for all, but has more recently been lamented in many online communities as causing a bigger problem than it solves, as many customers that received this fix reported third and fourth gears grinding {{from time to time}} while shifting. Afterwards, many owners of these vehicles have concluded that leaving the transmission alone was for the best, as the rattling noise has been proven to be harmless.|$|E

It demethylates veratric acid to {{a mixture of}} vanillic and isovanillic acids. These are both demethylated to protocatechuic acid, which undergoes ring cleavage to afford β-carboxy-cis-cis-muconic acid. The intermediacy of protocatechuic acid in the catabolic pathway of veratric acid was confirmed by <b>blocking</b> <b>ring</b> cleavage with an additional substituent in the ring: 5 -chlorovanillic acid was demethylated to 5 -chloro-protocatechuic acid, which accumulated. Chloro substituents in the ring of other methoxylated benzoic acids also arrested their normal metabolism by the Nocardia: an ortho-chloro substituent thwarted both demethylation and ring-opening. ortho-Hydroxylation of p-methoxybenzoic acid to isovanillic acid was unaffected by a chlorine ortho to the methoxyl group.

40|$|SummarySeparation {{of human}} sister chromatids {{involves}} the removal of DNA embracing cohesin ring complexes. Ring opening occurs by prophase-pathway-dependent phosphorylation and separase-mediated cleavage, {{with the former}} being antagonized at centromeres by Sgo 1 -dependent PP 2 A recruitment. Intriguingly, prophase pathway signaling and separase’s proteolytic activity also bring about centriole disengagement, whereas Sgo 1 is again counteracting this licensing step of later centrosome duplication. Here, we demonstrate that alternative splice variants of human Sgo 1 specifically and exclusively localize and function either at centromeres or centrosomes. A small C-terminal peptide encoded by exon 9 of SGO 1 (CTS for centrosomal targeting signal of human Sgo 1) is necessary and sufficient to drive centrosomal localization and simultaneously abrogate centromeric association of corresponding Sgo 1 isoforms. Cohesin is {{shown to be a}} target of the prophase pathway at centrosomes and protected by Sgo 1 -PP 2 A. Accordingly, premature centriole disengagement in response to Sgo 1 depletion is suppressed by <b>blocking</b> <b>ring</b> opening of an engineered cohesin...|$|E

It is very important to maintain the quality of video with compression. Our research work mainly focuses on finding the various artifacts caused in the video due to compression using H. 264 video technique. <b>Blocking,</b> <b>ringing</b> and flickering are the main artifacts found in the H. 264 compression. <b>Blocking</b> and <b>ringing</b> are reduced mostly with the use of in loop filter in the H. 264 codec. Even though <b>blocking</b> and <b>ringing</b> are reduced successfully, flickering is still seen in intra coded frames. Flickering is a temporal artifact which is otherwise known as mosquito noise is caused by change in the luminance values of the stationary region due to use of various prediction techniques.

40|$|Compression {{of digital}} video {{introduces}} artifacts (i. e., typical types of degradations), such as <b>Blocking,</b> Blurring, <b>Ringing.</b> Nowadays, digital video {{systems have been}} applied widely to various areas, and {{this has led to}} a rising demand for video quality metrics. In the past ten years, many automatic metrics of video quality have been developed; among them, the Wolf-Pinson metric is the better one. Based on the Wolf-Pinson metric, an Artifact-Measured-based Automatic Metric (AMAM) is proposed in this thesis, which measures four artifacts (<b>Blocking,</b> <b>Ringing,</b> Blurring and <b>Block</b> Flashing). Among them, Block Flashing is an artifact not previously measured, in the proposed metric, the Masking property of Human Visual System (HVS) is taken advantage to measure the <b>Blocking</b> and <b>Ringing</b> in order to improve performance. In this thesis, the performance of the automatic metrics is evaluated by using the Pearson linear correlation coefficient, Mean Square Error and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient.

INTRODUCTION At low bit rates, images and image sequences compressed by block discrete cosine transform (DCT) methods (e. g., JPEG, MPEG) suffer from <b>blocking</b> and <b>ringing.</b> Postprocessing to reduce these artifacts has appeal since it only requires the decompressed image.

40|$|Abstract—Expanding <b>ring</b> {{search and}} <b>blocking</b> {{expanding}} <b>ring</b> search are two prominent time-to-live value based search techniques for routes and resources in networks. Each uses a different technique {{to extend the}} search, with advantages in cost reduction that depend on the setting. In this paper, we introduce the Combined Expanding Ring Search which uses both techniques for extending the search {{in a way that}} guarantees expected costs at least as low as the lowest of the two. We show how to derive the search strategy with minimum expected costs in polynomial time, and in so doing introduce an important optimization to <b>blocking</b> expanding <b>ring</b> search. We further show how to convert an existing sequence of one type to a combined sequence in linear time, and how to derive the optimal sequence under delay constraints in polynomial time as well. In numerical evaluations of synthetic settings, we show that our optimization to <b>blocking</b> expanding <b>ring</b> search makes it far more efficient than previously considered, and consequently the combined search to far more efficient than either technique.

Unlike FR QA, where a reference is available to test against any distortion, NR QA approaches generally seek to capture {{one or a few}} distortions. Here we are mainly concerned with NR blur assessment, which remains an important problem in many applications. Generally, humans tend to conclude that images with more detail are of higher quality. Of course, the question is not so simple, since blur can be space-variant, may depend on depth-of-field (hence effect foreground and background objects differently), and may depend on what is being blurred in the image.|$|R
