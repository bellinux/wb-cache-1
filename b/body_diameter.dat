25|$|The Topol-M is a cold-launched, three-stage, solid-propellant, silo-based or road-mobile {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile. The missile's {{length is}} 22.7 m {{and the first}} stage has a <b>body</b> <b>diameter</b> of 1.9 m. The mass at launch is 47,200kg, including the 1,200kg payload. Topol-M carries a single warhead with an 800 kt yield but the design is compatible with MIRV warheads. According to chief designer Yury Solomonov, the missile can carry four to six warheads along with decoys. Its minimum range {{is estimated to be}} 2,000km and the maximum range 10,500km. It has three solid rocket stages with inertial, autonomous flight control utilizing an onboard GLONASS receiver. It is reputed to have the highest accuracy of any Russian ICBM with a CEP of 200m. The body of the rocket is made by winding carbon fiber.|$|E
25|$|The {{smooth green snake}} {{relies on}} an {{environment}} matching its green scales for camouflage to protect itself from predators. If threatened, a smooth green snake will usually flee. It is a docile snake, seldom biting and usually allowing humans to come close. If provoked, it can secrete a substance from its anal gland, causing a foul smell. When handled by humans, it usually shows excited behavior and calms down after wrapping itself around a finger. When it hunts, it turns its {{head from side to}} side, finding prey with its tongue and an organ on the roof of its mouth that interprets chemical signals. It has no ears, relying on vibrations to figure out its surroundings. Its sight is relatively strong over short distances. Due to stretchy ligaments in its jaw, it can swallow prey whole, even those that are larger than its own <b>body</b> <b>diameter.</b> It can shed its skin as often as every four to five weeks, allowing for growth.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{characterize}} the widthwise <b>body</b> <b>diameters</b> in children during the period 3 – 6 years of age {{on the base of}} data about six basic anthropometrical diameters. The data analyzed are for 6 basic <b>body</b> <b>diameters</b> as follows: biacromial, transversal and sagital chest diameters; bicristal, bispinal and bitrochanterial diameters in 440 children (210 boys and 130 girls) aged 3, 4, 5 and 6 years from kindergartens in Sofia town. During the period 3 - 6 years, the boys have bigger values for all investigated features with exception of bitrochanterial diameter, which in the 4 and 6 years old girls is bigger. The summarized increment of the diameters during the entire period is nearly equal in both sexes, slightly greater in girls. The growth velocity of the features is biggest during the age periods 3 - 4 and 5 - 6 years. Throughout the 4 -th and 5 -th year the growth velocity decreases with different degree for the separate diameters in both sexes, but more tangibly in girls. At 6 years of age the differences in body constitution in both sexes, evaluated by the studied features, are considerably smaller than they are in the 3 years old children due to the more intensive growth velocity and the bigger increase of <b>body</b> <b>diameters</b> in girls...|$|R

40|$|Larvas {{of malaria}} {{mosquito}} species live {{close to the}} water surface in shallow waters, and are exposed to water temperatures which differ considerably from the air or bulk water temperature. The present research aims to obtain a sound physical insight into processes which determine the water temperature profile. That is why, first, several outdoor experiments were made to collect physical evidence. Second, simple physical models are developed to simulate the temperature profile within small water bodies. The model simulations {{as well as the}} measurements show that during daytime strong temperature stratification occurs in relatively large water <b>bodies</b> (<b>diameter</b> > 1 m). This stratification is strongly dependent on wind speed and also on the vegetation of the surrounding environment of the water body. Throughout the night, however, a well-mixed layer develops growing from the water surface. Very small water bodies, however, mostly show a well mixed water layer during nighttime as well as during daytime. Model simulations agree well with the measurement results for relatively large water <b>bodies</b> (<b>diameter</b> > 1 m). Small water <b>bodies</b> (<b>diameter</b> < 0. 5 m), however, show a complex interaction between the atmosphere and the water-air interface and between the water body and the sediment below the water. It appears that the temperature behavior is very sensitive to the extinction coefficient for short wave radiation, which is closely related to the suspension of fine particles in the water. Subsequently, rain affects the water temperature dramatically during the rain event only. After such an event the normal course of the daily temperature cycle is more or less recovered...|$|R
