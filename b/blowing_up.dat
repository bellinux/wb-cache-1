5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail.

5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
5|$|In September 1942 {{men from}} No. 2 Commando {{took part in}} Operation Musketoon, a raid against the Glomfjord {{hydroelectric}} power plant. The Commandos were landed by submarine and succeeded in <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> some pipelines, turbines, and tunnels. This effectively destroyed the generating station and the aluminium plant was shut down permanently. One Commando {{was killed in the}} raid and another seven were captured while trying to escape. They spent a short time at Colditz Castle before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Shortly after their arrival at Sachsenhausen they were executed. They were the first victims of the secret Commando Order, which mandated the execution of all captured Commandos.

5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the critical nonlinear Schrödinger equation iut = −∆u − |u | 4 N u with initial condition u(0, x) = u 0 in dimension N. For u 0 ∈ H 1, local existence {{in time of}} solutions on an interval [0, T) is known, and there exists finite time <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> solutions, that is u 0 such that limt→T <+ ∞ |ux(t) | L 2 = +∞. This is the smallest power in the nonlinearity for which <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> occurs, and is critical in this sense. The question we address is to understand the <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> dynamic.
