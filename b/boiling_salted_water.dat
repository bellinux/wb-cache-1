50|$|The filled kroppkaka, palt or kams ball - {{as well as}} the flatter, {{unfilled}} flatpalt, flatkams and klabbe - is {{dropped into}} <b>boiling</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> and cooked until it floats. It is traditionally served warm with melted butter and lingonberry jam, although in some parts of southern Sweden the melted butter is replaced by half cream (a mix of milk and cream) or a warm milk sauce, and in parts of northern Sweden the butter is replaced by a warm milk sauce spiced with messmör. Leftover kroppkaka is often served halved and fried.|$|E
50|$|Mlinci is a dish in Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian cuisine. It {{is a thin}} dried flatbread that is easy {{to prepare}} by simply pouring <b>boiled</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> or soup over the mlinci.|$|R
50|$|Scraped: Traditionally, {{the fresh}} dough {{is placed on}} a moist, ideally tilted board. From there it is scraped in thin stripes into the <b>boiling</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> This {{traditional}} way is elaborate and requires practice.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, Spätzle {{are made}} by {{scraping}} long, thin strips of dough off a wooden (sometimes wet) chopping board (Spätzlebrett) into <b>boiling</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> where they cook until they rise to the surface. Altogether, the dough should thus be as viscous as to slowly flow apart if cut into strips with a knife, yet hold the initial shape for some seconds. If dropped into boiling water, the albumen will congeal quickly in the boiling water, while the yolk will keep the dough succulent. After the noodles have become firm, they are skimmed and put aside.|$|E
5000|$|Like many Italian dishes, gnocchi have {{considerable}} variation in recipes and names across different regions. For example, Lombard and Tuscan malfatti (literally [...] "poorly made") {{are made with}} ricotta, flour and spinach, {{as well as the}} addition of various other herbs if required, similar to Tuscan gnudi which distinctively contains less flour; Campanian strangulaprievete are flour-based gnocchi, just like Apulian cavatielli and Sardinian malloreddus, and so on. Gnocchi are commonly cooked on their own in <b>boiling</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> and dressed with various sauces depending on the type, and recipe used. Some gnocchi can be made from pieces of cooked polenta or semolina, which is spread out to dry and then layered with cheese and butter and finished in the oven.|$|E
5000|$|In Russia and Ukraine, {{crayfish}} ( [...] , sing. [...] ) are {{a traditional}} seasonal appetizer {{that is used}} as an accompaniment to beer and liquor. Although native varieties tend to be larger (usually, Astacus astacus), rampant freshwater pollution and years of overfishing largely limit availability to imports—most from Armenia, Kazakhstan and China. Prior to cooking, the crustaceans are soaked in water or milk, then boiled live for 7-15 minutes in rapidly <b>boiling</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> with additional ingredients, such as carrots, onion, dill, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns. More extravagant preparations include such ingredients as white wine, beer, sour cream, cloves, caraway seed, coriander seed, chili peppers, stinging nettle, etc. Russians rarely incorporate crayfish into complex dishes and, unlike other cultures, they usually consume the entire crayfish, short of the shell and the antennae. Russian and Ukrainian fascination with crayfish goes back quite far and generates considerable lore. An old proverb: [...] "When there is no fish, even crayfish is a fish." [...] There are as many myth associated with picking the freshest live crayfish as there are for picking ripe watermelons. Russians and Ukrainians, generally, will not cook fresh crayfish if the crustaceans are dead or perceptibly lethargic. (But pre-boiled frozen specimens are acceptable.) ...|$|E

40|$|Chlorpyriphos 20 EC {{was applied}} {{at the rate}} of 500 g a. i. ha - 1 in Cabbage heads and the samples {{harvested}} at intervals of 0 (2 hours after application), 1 and 7 days after application. The calculated half-life value and safe waiting period (8. 75 and 45. 29 days respectively), indicated its longer persistence. Thus, to reduce the safe waiting period, efforts were made to decontaminate the Chlorpyriphos residue from Cabbage head by various household preparations (viz. washing, cooking, washing plus cooking, <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> dipping, dipping in <b>boiled</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> dipping in detergent solution   and dipping in boiled detergent solution). Statistical analysis of the data using Duncan´s Multiple Range Test revealed that various household processing substantially reduced the residue of Chlorpyriphos in Cabbage heads in the range of 27. 89 - 73. 32 % but none were able to satisfactorily bring down the residue below the tolerance level of 0. 05 mg kg - 1. </div...|$|R

50|$|Natural gas {{was used}} by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE). They {{discovered}} a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to <b>boil</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States in 1825. By 2009, 66 000 km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000 km³ of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400 km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2-3% could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.|$|R
50|$|Several {{methods were}} {{applied in the}} {{preparation}} of locusts, prior to eating them. One of the more popular ways was to take the locusts after gathering them and to throw them into a pot of <b>boiling</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> After cooking for a few minutes, they were then removed from the pot and placed within a heated oven in order to dry them, or else spread out in the sun to dry. Once dry, they would take up the locusts and break off their heads, wings and legs and discard them, eating only the thorax and abdomen. Another method was to stoke an earthenware stove and, when fully heated, to cast them while alive into the cavity of the stove. Once roasted, they were taken out and a brine solution was sprinkled over them, before spreading them out in the sun to dry, usually upon one’s rooftop.|$|R
50|$|This {{disagreement}} about method {{is reflected in}} the subject literature. The Duden (reference book of German language) says that the Schupfnudel is a fried dish while Ludwig Zehetner writes in his Bavarian Dictionary that one should <b>boil</b> it in <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
50|$|A pasta {{dough is}} made using flour, <b>water</b> and <b>salt</b> and rolled {{out into a}} sheet. The pasta is cut into rounds that are stamped to form the {{embossed}} relief, and left to dry for a while. After <b>boiling</b> in <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> they are typically dressed with a walnut or mushroom sauce (the latter called Tocco de funzi, in Genoese) or alternatively with pesto. Around Novi a sauce of mushrooms and sausages is common.|$|R
50|$|In Romania, {{a similar}} recipe is called colțunași, in Transylvania and Bucovina called piroști and in Moldova called chiroște. Colţunaşi {{is often a}} dessert filled with jam (usually plum), fresh sour {{cherries}} or cottage cheese, or savory, filled with dill seasoned cheese (telemea or urdă), mashed potatoes or chopped meat. The dough is made with wheat flour and the colțunași are <b>boiled</b> in <b>salted</b> <b>water,</b> pan-fried in oil or baked in the oven.|$|R
5000|$|The dish is {{made from}} small new {{potatoes}} which are cleaned (but not peeled), then <b>boiled</b> in <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> Originally, seawater was used, but today it is more common to use tap water with a very generous amount of salt added. After cooking, the cooking water is removed and the potatoes are briefly left in the pot on the stove to dry off, until they become shrivelled with a fine salt crust.|$|R
50|$|A {{speciality}} of the Liguria cuisine, gianchetti {{are generally}} lightly <b>boiled</b> in <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> and served hot, dressed {{with oil and}} lemon juice. Another classic approach is to make fritters of the fish together with an egg and flour batter; finally they may simply be dipped in flour and deep fried (Frittelle di Gianchetti/Bianchetti). The gianchetti of a red colour (ruscetti, rossetti) are tougher and scaly to the palate: they are largely used to flavour fish-based sauces.|$|R
