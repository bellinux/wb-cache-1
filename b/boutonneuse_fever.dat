5000|$|<b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> (also called Mediterranean spotted fever, fièvre boutonneuse, Kenya tick typhus, Indian tick typhus, Marseilles fever, or African tick-bite fever) is a fever as {{a result}} of a rickettsial {{infection}} caused by the bacterium Rickettsia conorii and transmitted by the dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus. <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> can be seen in many places around the world, although it is endemic in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. This disease was first described in Tunisia in 1910 by Conor and Bruch and was named boutonneuse (French for [...] "spotty") due to its papular skin rash characteristics.|$|E
50|$|It is an obligate {{ectoparasite}} of many {{wild and}} domestic mammals such as domestic and wild carnivores, small rodents, and cattle. It {{is also a}} potential vector of <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> and canine babesiosis.|$|E
50|$|Rickettsia conorii is a Gram-negative, obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium of {{the genus}} Rickettsia that causes human disease called <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever,</b> Mediterranean spotted fever, Israeli tick typhus, Astrakhan spotted fever, Kenya tick typhus, Indian tick typhus, or other names that designate the locality of occurrence while having distinct clinical features. It {{is a member of}} the spotted fever group and the most geographically dispersed species in the group, recognized in most of the regions bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, Israel, Kenya, and other parts of North, Central, and South Africa, and India. The prevailing vector is the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The bacterium was isolated by Emile Brumpt in 1932 and named after A. Conor who, in collaboration with A. Bruch, provided the first description of <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> in Tunisia in 1910.|$|E
50|$|Since the long-eared {{hedgehog}} {{is naturally}} parasite prone and can carry diseases {{as bad as}} plague, it is highly recommended that, if kept as a pet, it should be purchased from a respected dealer.

50|$|Many Rhipicephalus are of economic, medical, and {{veterinary}} importance {{because they}} are vectors of pathogens. They transmit the pathogens that cause the animal and human diseases East Coast fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis, <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever,</b> Lyme disease, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and they inject a neurotoxin in their bite that leads to tick-caused paralysis.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-two hybridomas {{producing}} anti-Rickettsia conorii monoclonal antibodies {{were obtained}} by nine fusion experiments. The strain chosen for immunization of mice was MAVI, an R. conorii strain isolated from a Sicilian patient with <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever.</b> When tested for immunoglobulin isotype by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay, 46. 6 % of supernatants from the 22 hybridomas were immunoglobulin M.

Only five of the supernatants showed a positive IIF result on all tested strains, although they produced different titers to the various strains, possibly an indication that they recognized an antigen common to spotted fever group rickettsiae. Immunodominant epitopes for humans were determined by using patient sera to analyze inhibition of binding to the MAVI strain. Although {{a limited number of}} serum samples were screened, a high percentage of <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> patients produced antibodies recognizing the same epitopes as were recognized by the mouse monoclonal antibodies.

40|$|There are no {{vaccines}} against <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Previous {{studies have}} identified a Rickettsia rickettsii surface protein as a vaccine candidate and shown that an antigenically related protein is present in R. conorii, which causes <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever.</b> The gene encoding the R. rickettsii protein has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. We confirmed by 7. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of rickettsial lysates followed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody raised against the R. rickettsii protein that an analogous protein exists in R. conorii. Although these proteins were previously called 155 -kilodalton (kDa) proteins, we found that their apparent molecular masses were 198 kDa for R. conorii Kenya tick typhus and 190 kDa for R. rickettsii R. Using the R. rickettsii gene probe, we cloned and expressed a 5. 5 -kilobase HindIII fragment from R. conorii Kenya tick typhus genomic DNA in E. coli JM 107. The expressed recombinant product was recognized by a monospecific polyclonal rabbit antiserum prepared against the 198 -kDa protein. Guinea pigs immunized with sonic lysates of the E. coli strain expressing the recombinant gene product developed antibodies recognizing R. conorii when tested by a microimmunofluorescence antibody assay. Upon immunoblotting of rickettsial lysates, those antisera specifically recognized the 198 -kDa R. conorii protein and its 190 -kDa analog in R. rickettsii. Guinea pigs immunized with sonic lysates of the recombinant E. coli expressing the 198 -kDa protein were protected from experimental infections with the homologous R. conorii strain and partially protected from experimental infections with a strain of the heterologous species R. rickettsii. These findings show that the 198 -kDa R. conorii protein {{is a candidate for}} a vaccine against <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rickettsiae cause {{systemic}} infections such as Rocky Mountain {{spotted fever}} and <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever.</b> The main cellular target of these obligately intracellular bacteria is the endothelium. T lymphocytes {{are the most}} important effectors of immunity, and the CXCR 3 ligands CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 may {{play an important role in}} the T cell-mediated clearance of rickettsiae from the infected vasculature as suggested by recent expression studies. Here we showed that antibody-mediated neutralization of CXCL 9 and CXCL 10, and CXCR 3 gene knockout, had no effect on survival or bacterial loads of mice infected with rickettsiae. We also demonstrated that rickettsiae triggered the endothelial ex-pression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in vivo. These findings suggested that antigenic presentation by endothelial cells together with an endothelial inflammatory phenotype induced by the rick-ettsial infection may be sufficient to arrest T cells and trigger their anti-rickettsial effector mechanisms without the need for chemokines...|$|E
40|$|In 150 {{patients}} with <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever</b> (BF), caused by Rickettsia conorii, we studied the plasma levels of soluble l-selectin (sl-selectin), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (sVCAM- 1), intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1) and E-selectin (sE-selectin) in various phases of disease to clarify {{their role in}} disease evolution. Results indicate that during the acute phase of BF {{there is a significant}} increase in the serum levels of sl-selectin, sE-selectin, sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 1. sl-selectin and sVCAM- 1 returned to normal levels in the third week of disease, whereas sE-selectin and sICAM- 1 persisted at significantly high levels even after the third week. The secretion of these soluble CAMs in BF is mainly the result of leucocyte expression and endothelial cell activation, but secretion also appears to mediate anti-inflammatory activities, moderating leucocyte adhesion and reducing in particular lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration. Only sl-selectin serum levels were found to correlate with the acute phase of infection characterized by fever...|$|E

Rickettsia parkeri is an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the spotted fever group of rickettsiae; this organism has recently been found to be pathogenic to humans (1). Infection with R. parkeri can be considered an emerging infectious disease, referred to as R. parkeri rickettsiosis, American <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever,</b> and Tidewater spotted fever.

40|$|This {{proposal}} {{represents the}} cooperative {{efforts of the}} international tick research community to develop the first large scale genomic analysis of a medically significant tick, namely Ixodes scapularis. Ticks transmit the greatest variety of human and animal pathogens of any arthropod vector and are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of human disease (Fivaz et al., 1992; Sonenshine and Mather, 1994). Diseases transmitted by blood feeding ixodid ticks (subphylum Chelicerata; class Arachnida; subclass Acari; family Ixodidae) are global medical and veterinary health problems (Sonenshine, 1993) and include {{a wide variety of}} bacterial, rickettsial, viral and protozoan diseases. Other forms of pathogenesis attributed to ticks include anemia, dermatosis, toxemia and paralysis (Gothe, 1999; Roberts and Janovy, 1996; Sonenshine, 1991; Sonenshine, 1993). Important tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease (LD), tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever,</b> Queensland tick typhus, Q fever, and numerous arboviruses (Sonenshine, 1993). The resurgence of LD and the emergence of other tick-borne diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) (Childs and Paddock, 2003; Gratz, 1999; Paddock and Childs, 2003) pose increasing public health concerns.

Prior to ticks being submitted to the hemolymph test, they were disinfected. Only 5. 6 % (27 of 478) of the cultures were contaminated. A drop of hemolymph from each of 478 R. sanguineus ticks was cultured in two shell vials, and another drop was stained by the Gimenez method or indirect immunofluorescence.

Thus, 50 of 369 (13. 5 %) examined ticks were hemolymph test positive, and 44 (11. 9 %) cultures were positive. After disinfection, another pool of 62 ticks were examined by the hemolymph test. The ticks were kept individually in a sterile environment. A few days later, the hemolymph of these ticks was collected again and cultured. The contamination rate was not significantly higher (6. 4 %) than in the above-described conditions. It allowed us to isolate eight more strains.

We genotyped for + 896 A/G TLR 4 polymorphism 78 patients affected with <b>Boutonneuse</b> <b>fever,</b> 78 age-matched controls and 78 advanced age individuals from Sicily. The + 869 G allele, that attenuates receptor signalling, was significantly overrepresented in patients in comparison with age-matched controls. By analyzing data according to gender, this allele was significantly higher in female patients when compared to advanced age women. Pro-inflammatory responses are programmed to resist fatal infections. So, it is not surprising that the genetic background of people that survive to an advanced age may be protective against infections. However, this seems to occur in women but not in men. In a previous study, the + 896 G TLR 4 allele was overrepresented in advanced age men and underrepresented in men affected by myocardial infarction. Thus, previous and present results tend to agree with the suggestion that men and women may follow different trajectories to reach longevity.

In the vasculature, HO regulates the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, among which the inducible isozyme COX- 2 facilitates the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). Using in vitro and ex vivo models of infection, we demonstrate here that R. rickettsii infection of human EC causes robust induction of COX- 2 mRNA and protein expression but has no apparent effect on the constitutive COX- 1 isoform. Cells infected with viable rickettsiae consistently displayed significantly increased secretion of 6 -keto-PGF 1 α and PGE 2. R. rickettsii-induced COX- 2 was sensitive to inhibitors of de novo transcription and the pyridinylimidazole-based compound SB 203580, suggesting that this transcriptional host cell response involves signaling through p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. PG production by infected cells was abrogated by NS 398 (a selective COX- 2 inhibitor) and indomethacin (a pan-COX inhibitor). Immunohistochemical staining of sections of infected umbilical cords and corresponding uninfected controls revealed comparatively more intense and abundant staining for COX- 2 in infected endothelia. Induction of the endothelial COX- 2 system and the resultant enhanced release of vasoactive PGs may contribute to the regulation of inflammatory responses and vascular permeability changes during spotted fever rickettsioses...|$|E
40|$|Residents {{of western}} {{countries}} travel {{more and more}} to (sub) tropical areas for holidays or work. During their stay they come in contact with insects and parasites susceptible to induce skin disorders that can manifest during their stay or after returning. This dermatosis account for approximately 10 % of referral to outpatient tropical clinics. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide family physicians not familiar with these pathologies some practical guidelines to help them to identify and treat some tropical dermatosis: cutaneous larva migrans, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, rickettsiosis. Cutaneous larva migrans is the most frequent serpiginous itching eruption observed in travellers. It is cause by transepidermal penetration of animal hookworms (ancylostomas) through contact with soil infested with cat and dog feces. Effective treatments include topical thiabendazole or oral albendazole or ivermectine. Persons visiting mediterranean countries can acquire cutaneous leishmanisis that has many clinical presentations; the most typical is 'bouton d'Orient', which manifests as painless ulceration resistant to antibiotic treatment. Treatment with intralesionel pentavalent antimony or pentamidine injection are effective. Lyme disease is an endemic infection in certain areas of North America and Europe, caused by the spirochete borrelia and transmitted through tick bite. It manifest as non-itching large persistent migrant erythema. If untreated this infection may expose to chronic debilitating rheumatologic, cardiac and neurological complications. Rickettsiosis, especially <b>boutonneuse</b> <b>fever,</b> area a potentially fatal multisystemic infectious disease transmitted through the bite of a dog tick. Diagnosis must be evoked in the presence of a brutal fever syndrome, a painless eschar and widespread eruption associate to systemic symptoms. This infection must be recognized clinically in order to begin rapidly treatment with cyclines. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
