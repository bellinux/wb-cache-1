500|$|Shankly {{wrote in}} his {{autobiography}} that times were hard during his upbringing and that hunger was a prevailing condition, especially during the winter months. He admitted {{that he and his}} friends used to steal vegetables from nearby farms; bread, biscuits and fruit from suppliers' wagons, and bags of coal from the pits. Shankly admitted the act was wrong but claimed it was [...] "devilment more than badness" [...] and the root cause was their constant hunger, but he insists that he and his friends learned from their mistakes and became <b>better</b> <b>people</b> in later years. He was at school from age five until 14. Discipline at both home and school was strict but Shankly said it was character-building. His favourite subject was geography and he played football as often as possible, especially in the school playground, but there was no organised school team.|$|E

2500|$|The {{religious}} {{disputes that}} prompted settlement in America were important topics of early American literature.

Edward Winslow also recorded a diary of the first years after the Mayflower's arrival. [...] "A modell of Christian Charity" [...] by John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts, was a Sermon preached on the Arbella (the flagship of the Winthrop Fleet) in 1630.

Other religious writers included Increase Mather and William Bradford, author of the journal published as a History of Plymouth Plantation, 1620–47. Others like Roger Williams and Nathaniel Ward more fiercely argued state and church separation.

2500|$|JR and Babe (now {{portrayed by}} Baker) become closer and reunite romantically. JR teams {{up with his}} father, Adam, just like old times. Their goal is to take down Fusion Cosmetics. JR tries to enlist Babe into their scheme. What JR does not know, though, is that Adam is {{secretly}} planning to ruin him in the process. JR and Babe bond, as Adam plans the ultimate takeover. Fusion Cosmetics is at a height of excellence and things are working wonderfully. Babe and JR decide to use [...] "Bella" [...] (a new perfume designed by Babe) to launch her career. They begin to plan their next wedding and decide {{to have a second}} child. Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt (Daniel Kennedy), who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby (Brianne Moncrief), JR's sister, gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She has an ulterior motive, as her and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, they have to come back when Adam has them subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss, declare that they made each other <b>better</b> <b>people</b> and that they love each other from the deepest part of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what.

2500|$|After Richie's death, Fusion is at {{a height}} of excellence. During this time, Babe and Amanda, who have renewed their friendship, develop a [...] "secret project" [...] which they think Kendall and Greenlee will approve, since Fusion is doing so well. The project {{turns out to be}} a {{fragrance}} designed for working women. Kendall refuses to support it, but Amanda offers to use part of her fortune to finance the fragrance. Kendall insults Babe for the working girl perfume being modeled after her, and this is when Amanda decides to call the perfume [...] "Bella." [...] Kendall and Greenlee let Amanda and Babe do the project on their own, and the perfume has high buzz. Amanda and Babe get into a little argument about which woman should be the promotional figure for Bella, in which Babe and Amanda want themselves on it. They ask Kendall, who could not care less, who then chooses Amanda. Amanda takes it as a compliment before Kendall says how the [...] "slutty" [...] look should appeal. Amanda organizes a launch party which goes well, except for Taylor Thompson killing Randi Morgan's pimp in the bathroom hallway. Things are working wonderfully, and JR and Babe decide to use Bella to launch her career, and they decide they should take over the company. They also begin to plan their next wedding and decide to have a second child.
