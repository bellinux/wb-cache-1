25|$|Schofield's {{advance guard}} arrived in Franklin at about 4:30a.m. on November 30. Jacob Cox, a {{division}} commander temporarily commanding the XXIII Corps, immediately began preparing strong defensive positions around the deteriorated entrenchments originally constructed for a previous engagement in 1863. Schofield decided to defend at Franklin {{with his back}} to the river because he had no pontoon bridges available that would enable his men to cross the river. Schofield needed time to repair the permanent bridges spanning the river, but by mid-afternoon, nearly all the supply wagons were across the Harpeth and on the road to Nashville. By noon the Union works formed an approximate semicircle around the town. A gap in the line occurred where the Columbia Pike entered the outskirts of the town, left open to allow passage of the wagons. Just behind the center of the formidable line stood the Carter House, appropriated as Cox's headquarters. Two Union brigades from Wagner's division were positioned about a half mile forward of the main line. Wagner, perhaps misunderstanding his orders, ordered his three brigades to stop halfway to the Union line and dig in as best they could on the flat ground. Col. Emerson Opdycke considered Wagner's order to <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> and refused to obey it; he marched his brigade through the Union line and into a reserve position behind the gap through which the Columbia Pike passed, leaving the brigades of Cols. John Q. Lane, and Joseph Conrad in front.|$|E

Jessica differs from many other Chase heroines by being interested in fashion; the author felt that [...] "the way they dress, to a great extent, tells us who they are, {{in the same way that}} other heroines’ simpler or less fashionable attire expresses something about them".|$|E
500|$|Shuffle! the anime {{television}} series received mixed reviews from critics. Theron Martin of Anime News Network described the anime as although [...] "genuinely enjoyable", often [...] "alternating between brazen stupidity, lame jokes, and disgusting sweetness" [...] criticizing {{it as being}} a typical harem anime that offered little new content. Helen Ellingwood of Active Anime disagreed stating that Shuffle! contained what she described {{as the most important}} ingredient, which sets it apart from other harem anime: [...] "heart". Anime News Network's Carlo Santos agreed with Martin's assessment, agreeing with the show's lack of novelty and stating that the highlight of the anime is its comedy, but that its romance is [...] "slowly running the series into the ground." [...] However, D. F. Smith of IGN stated that it actually does well against other harem anime as it [...] "may <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> exploitative, a simultaneous affront to good sense and good taste, but at least it's good for a chuckle or two". Smith criticized the ending for lacking [...] "intensity"; however, Ellingwood praised it for showing the consequences of avoiding which heroine the protagonist would choose to love, unlike harem anime she had prior.|$|E

500|$|John Locke in his Essays on the Law of Nature {{argued that}} the {{widespread}} fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state. Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether accepting a statement like [...] "follow your conscience" [...] supports subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: [...] "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid." [...] Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed {{on the basis of}} conscience with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth. William Godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of the [...] "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" [...] that they possess free will. Adam Smith considered that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people. John Stuart Mill believed that idealism about the role of conscience in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling. Mill held that certain amount of conscience, and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for representative government, but that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good." ...|$|E

Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film The Graduate (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft.

2500|$|The Chinese Wall Theory {{essentially}} {{rests on}} a cost benefit hypothesis, where the Ming recognized the highly resistant nature of their walls to structural damage, and could not imagine any affordable development of the guns available to {{them at the time}} to be capable of breaching said walls. Even as late as the 1490s a Florentine diplomat considered the French claim that [...] "their artillery is capable of creating a breach in a wall of eight feet in thickness" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> and the French [...] "braggarts by nature." [...] In fact twentieth century explosive shells had some difficulty creating a breach in tamped earthen walls.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?" [...] When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do protest music, Gordy cautioned him, [...] "Marvin, don't <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> That's taking things too far." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two Union brigades were {{positioned}} about a {{half mile}} forward of the main line. Wagner's division had been the last to arrive from Spring Hill, and after briefly stopping at Winstead Hill before Hood arrived, he ordered his brigades under Colonels Emerson Opdycke, John Q. Lane, and Joseph Conrad (who had replaced Luther Bradley, wounded at Spring Hill) to stop halfway to the Union line and dig in {{as best they could}} on the flat ground. Stanley had earlier ordered Wagner to hold Winstead Hill until dark unless he was pressed, and it is possible that Wagner somehow translated these orders into the notion that he was supposed to hold a line south of the main position. Opdycke considered Wagner's order to <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> and refused to obey it; he marched his brigade through the Union line and into a reserve position behind the gap through which the Columbia Pike passed. (A few days after his ill-considered position was overrun in the Confederate advance, Wagner was relieved of command at his own request.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those who}} took notice were the Beatles. Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were known as great admirers of Beefheart. Lennon {{displayed}} two of the album's promotional [...] "baby bumper stickers" [...] in the sunroom at his home. Later, the Beatles planned to sign Beefheart to their experimental Zapple label (plans that were scrapped after Allen Klein took over the group's management). Van Vliet was often critical of the Beatles, however. He considered the lyric [...] "I'd love to turn you on" [...] from their song A Day in the Life, to <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> and conceited. Tiring of their [...] "lullabies", he lampooned them with the Strictly Personal song Beatle Bones 'n' Smokin' Stones, that featured the sardonic refrain of [...] "...strawberry fields, all the winged eels slither {{on the heels of}} today's children, strawberry fields forever". Vliet spoke badly of Lennon after getting no response when he sent a telegram of support to him and wife Yoko Ono during their 1969 [...] "Bed-In for peace". Van Vliet did meet McCartney in Cannes during the Magic Band's 1968 tour of Europe, though McCartney later claimed to have no recollection of this meeting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{members of}} Our Lady Peace began writing new {{material}} together {{soon after the}} Gravity tour began. In October 2002 they returned briefly to Bob Rock's Maui studio to record two unfinished songs from Gravity that were planned to be released on a soundtrack, which never happened. [...] "Working with him on that soundtrack song was just another reaffirmation for us how well we work together," [...] Maida stated in an October interview. [...] "With the way this band has grown, and the way we've come to trust Bob, it would <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> for us to look for another producer now. When we're all together, {{we feel like we}} can do anything. We have to go at least one more round with him. I think we just scratched the surface of what we can do together." [...] By the end of 2002, the band was eager to re-enter the studio in Maui to begin laying down demos with Rock. Two new songs, [...] "Not Afraid" [...] and [...] "Talk is Cheap" [...] were premiered in March 2003 while touring in Europe with Avril Lavigne.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2016 feature via The Quietus, Kavus Torabi {{shed light}} on several past, present, and future Cardiacs projects. [...] It was an {{extraordinarily}} interesting and brilliant time for me because we’d already talked {{a great deal about}} what the plan was {{for the next few years}} for Cardiacs. We were going to make a film. Tim and I were planning out loads of treatments and scripts. Tim wanted to share the burden of Cardiacs a bit with someone and I was more than happy to do that. The way things stand, [...] is nearly done but needs vocals and eyebrows and some of them need a few other touches. What there is does sound great but there’s far more stuff completed that hasn’t come out yet, that needs to come out. Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would <b>be</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E
