5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 2010, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) {{announced}} that Uzbek judoka Shokir Muminov had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of his silver {{medal in the}} 81kg bout after he tested positive for methylhexanamine. The two bronze medalists, Japan's Masahiro Takamatsu and Kazakhstan's Islam Bozbayev, were promoted as silver medalists.|$|E

5000|$|After the home-and-away {{season was}} finished, 's {{reserves}} and under-19s teams <b>were</b> <b>stripped</b> of any premiership points earned in matches {{in which they}} fielded Frank Loughran, an unregistered player from the Latrobe Valley. The reserves team, which went through the entire season undefeated, <b>was</b> <b>stripped</b> of twelve premiership points; it fell from first to second on the ladder, but still {{went on to win}} the premiership. The under-19s team <b>was</b> <b>stripped</b> of 28 premiership points, and dropped out of the final four as a result.|$|R
5|$|Only one winner {{has ever}} <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> {{of the award}} – US cyclist Lance Armstrong, whose 2003 award was {{rescinded}} by the BBC following the UCI's 2012 decision to strip Armstrong of his titles and ban him for life from the sport.|$|E
5|$|After Edward Elric recovers {{his arm and}} {{his brother}} Alphonse's body, Edward is dragged from his homeworld through the Gate of Alchemy—the source of alchemical energy—to a {{parallel}} world of Earth in 1923. The world is fundamentally governed {{by the laws of}} modern science instead of alchemy. When Edward arrives there, he discovers that he has <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of his alchemical powers and his newly restored arm and leg.|$|E
5|$|The name El Chal first {{appears on}} a Spanish Colonial {{watercolour}} from 1735 {{together with other}} villages in the region, {{with the name of}} El Chal or El Chacal. It also appears on a map of central and southeastern Petén from 1860, together with Poptún, Concepción, San Clemente and the ruins of Ixkun. Some of the stonework from the ruins has <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> {{to be used in the}} construction of the modern village.|$|E

5|$|This {{plan was}} {{affected}} by {{the needs of the}} war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament {{was concerned about the}} threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|Exeter had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of his armour {{and left}} for dead on the {{battlefield}} at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured. His followers found him {{and took him to}} Westminster Abbey. On his recovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward's rule. Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses. Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported to have fallen overboard and drowned without any witnesses.|$|E

5|$|F. On November 18, 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that Rashid Ramzi of Bahrain had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> {{of the gold}} medal in the men's 1500 m race. Ramzi had been the first athlete from Bahrain to win an Olympic gold medal. His frozen blood sample was re-tested and found to contain traces of Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), a stamina-building blood-booster. Kenyan Asbel Kipruto Kiprop was upgraded to gold, Nicholas Willis of New Zealand was given the silver and Mehdi Baala of France received the bronze.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, two Bristol Blenheims of No. 114 Squadron RAF made {{an attack}} on Frecamp and Dieppe, {{dropping}} bombs from high altitude. The Germans recorded no damage at Frecamp, and the attack on Dieppe seems to have gone unnoticed. As the bombers headed home, they passed two Spitfires of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). These high-speed aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of non-essential weight such as armament and radios and were fitted with cameras and extra fuel tanks. They photographed ports and airfields and then returned.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1862 a {{revolution}} broke out, {{which led to}} the eviction of King Otho I from the country. Makriyannis's son, the future general Othon Makriyannis, reportedly presented his father with the King's golden crown. Makriyannis was restored to the ranks he had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of {{as a result of his}} trial, and was re-elected as a representative of Athens to the new National (Constitutional) Assembly of 1864. He was promoted to the rank of general on 20 April 1864, and died on 27 April.|$|E

5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2013 CMLL {{announced}} that the Mexican National Lightweight Championship had been vacated, without stating specifically why previous champion Pierrothito had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of the championship. They also announced a 12-man tournament to determine a new champion that would start on July 30 with a six-man torneo cibernetico elimination match and a second six-man cibernetico the following week. The winners of each block faced off on August 13, 2013 to determine the new champion. The finals saw Eléctrico defeat Pequeño Nitro to win the championship.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{during this}} period. The masonry {{of the castle}} had probably <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> for use as local building materials, as this part of England was traditionally very short of suitable stone. Edward VI gave the castle to Sir John Checke, until it reverted to Mary I. After Mary, the castle was acquired by Sir Gervase Elwes, whose family retained it until the 19th century. At some point after 1720, the surviving east and south sides of the inner bailey walls were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were originally faced with a local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along {{the eastern end of}} the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
