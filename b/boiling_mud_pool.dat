Legend tells of his wily escape from the bird-woman Kurangaituku, by hiding inside a rock and then leading her into a <b>boiling</b> <b>mud</b> <b>pool.</b> Having grown into a man of ability and confidence, he led his people in battle against their enemy, chief Raumati, who had burned the Te Arawa canoe. Killing this powerful enemy, he gained great respect and mana, and set himself on the path to becoming {{one of the most famous}} of all Māori warriors. The parents of Ha-tupatu were Ha-nui and Ha-roa. (Note that Ha-roa is equivalent to Ha-loa, a major deity in Hawaiian mythology.) ...|$|E
40|$|While well {{established}} as a crime writer in her native country New Zealand and abroad, in the Golden Age of crime writing, between the two World Wars, Ngaio Marsh also explored more than the simple ‘whodunit’ genre. Along with mysterious and sudden deaths and the investigations by her professional police investigator, Roderick Alleyn, whose intelligence is matched by his intuition, Marsh also revels in the uncanny and supernatural, several spectacular and innovative means of murder (involving wool presses in one and a <b>boiling</b> <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> in another), the impact of locale, especially isolation, on the actions of criminals and victims, and the workings, {{in a couple of}} her New Zealand based stories, of makutu or Māori magic. In an attempt to further the debate concerning New Zealand writing and the nature of a New Zealand Gothic, first identified by William Shafer in his 1998 work Mapping the Godzone, this paper considers the Gothic elements of Marsh’s four detective novels set in New Zealand, A Vintage Murder, 1937, Colour Scheme, 1943, Died in the Wool, 1945 and Photo Finish, 1980...|$|E
40|$|The euglenoids are {{unicellular}} eukaryotic flagellates {{living in}} a diversity of soils and aquatic environments and ecosystems. This study describes the ultrastructure of an euglenoid isolated {{from the surface of}} a <b>boiling</b> <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> with temperatures ranging from 38 to 98 °C and pH 2 - 4. The hot mud pool is located in Area de Pailas de Barro, Las Pailas, Rincón de la Vieja Volcano, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The morphological characterization of the Euglena pailasensis was performed by SEM and TEM. It was determined that, although the euglenoid was obtained from an extreme volcanic environment, the general morphology corresponds to that of a typical member of Euglena of 30 - 45 μm long and 8 - 10 μm wide, with membrane, pellicle, chloroplasts, mitochondria, nucleus, pigments and other cytoplasmic organelles. E. pailasensis is delimited by a membrane and by 40 to 90 pellicle strips. It was observed up to 5 elongated chloroplasts per cell. The chloroplast contains several osmiophilic globules and a pyrenoid penetrated by few thylakoid pairs. The nutritious material is reserved in numerous small paramylon grains located {{at the center of the}} cell, mitocondria are characterized by the presence of crests in radial disposition toward the interior of the lumen. It was also observed around the external surface “pili” like filaments originating from the pellicle strips. There is no evidence for the presence of flagella in the ampulla (reservoir/canal area), a fact confirmed by negative staining, and a difference regarding other species of Euglena. The observed ultrastructural characteristics are not sufficient to explain the adaptation of this species to acid and hot environment...|$|E

5000|$|Waiotapu (Māori for [...] "sacred waters") is {{an active}} {{geothermal}} area {{at the southern end}} of the Okataina Volcanic Centre, just north of the Reporoa caldera, in New Zealand's Taupo Volcanic Zone. It is 27 kilometres south of Rotorua. Due to dramatic geothermal conditions beneath the earth, the area has many hot springs noted for their colourful appearance, in addition to the Lady Knox Geyser, Champagne Pool, Artist's Palette, Primrose Terrace and <b>boiling</b> <b>mud</b> <b>pools.</b> These can mostly be viewed through access by foot, and in addition to a paid and curated experience, naturally forming hot springs appear around the area. The geothermal area covers 18 square kilometres. Prior to European occupation the area was the homeland of the Ngati Whaoa tribe who descended from those on the Arawa waka (canoe).|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{data on the}} geochemical {{composition of}} <b>boiling</b> <b>mud</b> <b>pools</b> at the Mutnovsky volcano. The physicochemical characteristics of the pools and the concentrations of major, minor and trace elements in pool solutions vary widely. A comparison of the geochemical compositions of host rocks and solutions indicates that leaching from rocks {{is not the only}} source of chemicals in thermal solutions. Geophysical studies reveal the inner structure of thermal fields, which reflect the shapes of the underground reservoirs and feed channels. Using geophysical methods (electrical resistivity tomography and frequency domain investigations), it was shown that the vertical structure and complex geochemical zonation of the feed channels leads to a high contrast in the compositions of the mud solutions. These findings answer questions about the origin and composition of surface manifestations. To elucidate the mechanisms of solution formation, an attempt was made to describe the magmatic fluid evolution and the resulting mixing of waters by physical and mathematical models. The model illustrates fluid migration from a magma chamber to the surface. It is shown that the formation of brines corresponding to the <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> composition is possible during secondary boiling...|$|R
40|$|The local {{groundwater}} {{system and}} surface geothermal {{features such as}} geysers, <b>boiling</b> <b>pools,</b> <b>mud</b> <b>pools,</b> and steaming ground at Wairakei, New Zealand, have been strongly affected by 50 years of fluid extraction from the underlying Wairakei geothermal reservoir. For this study we have used geothermal reservoir and surface water data to calibrate a two-dimensional (2 -D) numerical model, using the TOUGH 2 geothermal simulator (Pruess, 1991), which links reservoir drawdown to changes in geothermal outflow from the Alum Lakes area of the Wairakei system. The 2 -D model {{is based on an}} existing three-dimensional (3 -D) computer model of Wairakei system, but uses a finer grid {{in the vicinity of the}} Alum Lakes. The model shows that pressure decline in the Wairakei reservoir has resulted in a cessation of the geothermal upflow to the overlying Alum Lakes, and the Alum Lakes feeder conduit now hosts a down flow of groundwater...|$|R

60|$|We {{then went}} to the mud-springs, which are about a mile off, and are still more curious. On a sloping tract of ground in a slight hollow is a small lake of liquid mud, with patches of blue, red, or white, and in many places boiling and {{bubbling}} most furiously. All around on the indurated clay are small wells and craters full of <b>boiling</b> <b>mud.</b> These seem to be forming continually, a small hole appearing first, which emits jets of steam and <b>boiling</b> <b>mud,</b> which upon hardening, forms a little cone with a crater in the middle. The ground for some distance is very unsafe, as it is evidently liquid at a small depth, and bends with pressure like thin ice.

40|$|Herschel Island, {{located in}} the {{southern}} Beaufort Sea, Western Canadian Arctic, shows a clear response to the global warming. Due to its ice-rich permafrost it is highly affected by environmental forcing and known for its high erosion rates and retrogressive thaw slump activity. Even though retrogressive thaw slumps {{have an effect on}} carbon and nitrogen cycling, until now there is not much known about the processes and carbon and nitrogen availability within a retrogressive thaw slump at a circumarctic scale. To provide new insides in this particular field, the retrogressive thaw slump “Slump D” on Herschel Island was divided into undisturbed (tundra zone, permafrost zone), and disturbed zones (<b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> zone, slump floor zone) and sampled via a fishnet grid. The tundra, <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> and slump floor zones were sampled at 0 to 30 cm depth, for the permafrost zone permafrost profiles of up to 340 cm depth were sampled. In total 100 samples were analysed in their biogeochemical parameters (total organic carbon(TOC) -, total carbon(TC) -, total nitrogen(TN) -content) and stable isotope content (δ 13 Corg). The organic carbon source was determined for all zones to illustrate eventual differences in the deposition milieu. To show the degree of decomposition and degradation during the slumping process TOC/TN-ratio and δ 13 Corg were used as proxys. The results show that the tundra zone has the highest TC-, TOC- and TN-values follwed by the permafrost zone. The lowest values are determined for the slump floor and the <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> zone. All of the zones show similar δ 13 Corg-values of - 26. 9 ‰but obvious differences in the TOC/TN-ratio. From the results it is concluded that the tundra zone shows a higher degradation than the permafrost zone but less than the <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> and slump floor zone. Based on the high TOC/TN-values for the permafrost zone a vulnerable zone where carbon and nitrogen is available for decomposition during thawing processes is indicated. Due to the better quality of the organic matter within the permafrost zone labile carbon can be released right after thawing. The <b>mud</b> <b>pool</b> as well as the slump floor are highly degraded and store the more stable carbon which stays in the soil for several years. Within the slump floor zone no differences in degradation or composition are visible even though there is a mixture of old and new vegetated areas. With this findings the first step is made to understand the influence of degrading permafrost on carbon and nitrogen dynamics within a retrogressive thaw slump...|$|R
