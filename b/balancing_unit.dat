40|$|International audienceThe {{power output}} of a wind turbine depends on wind speed, {{and on the}} {{physical}} and operating characteristics of the turbine. Then, the variability associated to wind power generation is relevant, and it {{is due to the}} wind uncertain and intermittent character. This intrinsic variability has a significant effect on power system operations such as regulation, load following, <b>balancing,</b> <b>unit</b> commitment and scheduling. Therefore, for the safe, reliable and economic operation of power systems, the accurate prediction of wind power and of the associated uncertainty is critical. In this study, we consider historical values of wind power for predicting future values of wind power itself, taking into account both the variability in the input and the uncertainty in the model structure. Uncertainty in the input (hourly wind power) is represented as an interval range which captures the within-hour variability. A Neural Network (NN) is trained on interval-valued input to provide output prediction intervals (PIs). A multi-objective genetic algorithm (namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)) is used to train the NN. The multi-objective framework allows finding PIs which are optimal both in terms of accuracy (coverage probability) and efficacy (width) ...|$|E
40|$|Electricity load {{forecasts}} are {{an integral}} part of many decision-making pro- cesses in the electricity market. However, most literature on electricity load forecasting concentrates on deterministic forecasts, neglecting possibly impor- tant information about uncertainty. A more complete picture of future demand can be obtained by using distributional forecasts, allowing for a more effcient decision-making. A predictive density can be fully characterized by tail mea- sures such as quantiles and expectiles. Furthermore, interest often lies in the accurate estimation of tail events rather than in the mean or median. We pro- pose a new methodology to obtain probabilistic forecasts of electricity load, that is based on functional data analysis of generalized quantile curves. The core of the methodology is dimension reduction based on functional principal components of tail curves with dependence structure. The approach has sev- eral advantages, such as flexible inclusion of explanatory variables including meteorological forecasts and no distributional assumptions.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with the}} Norwegian transmission system operator, Statnett, and their research on two new interconnectors linking Norway to England and Germany. The work presented in this thesis has considered one of these interconnectors, with a third terminal connected offshore to allow for integration of offshore wind power and oil platforms, as shown in fig. ~ref{fig:theGrid}. Investigation of the voltage source converters (VSCs) control ability as well as operational aspects of multi-terminal DC-grids has been performed. Identified as the key control variable of a DC-grid is the DC-voltage serving as a measure of power balance, since an unbalance will affect the DC-voltage through charging or discharging of the DC-capacitances. Utilizing VSCs allowing a fast and accurate control of the DC-voltage can lead to a stable operation of a DC-grid. The three-terminal structure, fig. ~ref{fig:theGrid}, was implemented in the simulation tool SIMPOW and connected to a 35 -node AC-grid model representing the Nordic grid. The simulation model was used for analyzes of the DC-grid operation and its affect on the connected AC-grids. The converter station connected to the Nordic grid were applied with DC-voltage control, implying that it will act as the power <b>balancing</b> <b>unit</b> of the DC-grid. The simulations performed show that the control structure implemented could assure a stable DC-grid operation within 0. 3 s of a fault. It identified the need for a fast response to changes in the DC-voltage as the influence of the other connected AC-grids were directly linked to DC-voltage oscillations. Simulations were also conducted to study the advantage of applying AC-voltage control compared to reactive power for the converter connected to the Nordic grid. It was identified that an increased stability of the Nordic grid could be assured during faults in the grid itself. This also affected the DC-grid operation through an increased capability of power exchange with the Nordic grid. </p...|$|E

40|$|Work with {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} {{can be found}} in most industries all over the world. This type of work exposes the operators to different kind of loads like gripping-forces, feed-forces, exposure to vibration and noise, holding hot or cold surfaces and the exposure to dust. Designing a power tool with good ergonomics is a matter of finding the best compromise. As a simple example, increasing the mass is not acceptable because it will increase the forces needed to handle the tool. At the same time increased mass will in most cases reduce the vibrations. Vibration disorders related to the use of hand-held power tools has been known and reported since long. It is therefore essential that low vibrating tools are developed and used. The new vibration regulations in Europe, based on the Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive, have put increased focus on the vibration control in industry. Forces acting on the tool cause vibration Tools for industrial use must be of very robust design to withstand the very hard use they are exposed to. Industrial tools are therefore normally designed with the main parts made of metal. From a vibration point of view this means that most tools can be regarded as rigid bodies, especially because the dominating frequency normally is equal to the rotational frequency of the tool spindle or the blow frequency for a percussive tool. These frequencies are with few exceptions below 200 Hz. Handles however can not always be regarded as rigidly connected to the tool. There are several examples of weak suspensions designed to reduce vibration transmitted to the hands of the operator. There are also examples of designs where the handles just happened to be non-rigidly connected and in some cases even in resonance within the frequency region of interest. Oscillating forces act on the tool and the result is vibration. Design principals In all cases forces are the source of vibration. This leads to the three basic principles to control vibration: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Control the magnitude of the vibrating forces. Examples are the <b>balancing</b> <b>unit</b> on a grinder or the differential piston in a chipping hammer. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Make the tool less sensitive to the vibrating forces. Examples can be when the mass of the guard on a grinder is rigidly connected to the tool to increase the inertia of the tool. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Isolate the vibrations in the tool from the grip surfaces. Examples are vibration-dampening handles on grinders or pavement breakers, the air-spring behind the blow-mechanism in a riveting hammer or the mass spring system in a chipping hammer...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{electrical}} heating (DEH) of pipelines is a {{flow assurance}} method that {{has proven to}} be a good and reliable solution for preventing the formation of hydrates and wax in multiphase flow lines. The technology is installed on several pipelines in the North Sea and has become StatoilHydros preferred method for flow assurance. Tyrihans is the newest installation with 10 MW DEH for a 43 km pipline. However, the pipeline represents a considerable single-phase load which makes the power system dependent on a <b>balancing</b> <b>unit</b> for providing symmetrical conditions. This limits the step out distance and is not suitable for subsea installation. Aker Solutions has proposed several specially connected transformers for subsea power supply of DEH systems, Scott-T being one of them. The Scott-T transformer is a three-to-two-phase transformer which provides balanced electrical power between the two systems when the two secondary one-phase loads are equal. By implementing this transformer, it can be possible to install the power supply subsea as there is no need for a <b>balancing</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, the system may be applicable for long step out distances. This is because the pipeline is inductive and can use the reactive power produced by the long cable which also can increase the critical cable length. There are however some limitations on this system using the Scott-T transformer. There is a large variation in the magnetic permeability between individual joints of the pipeline. This can result in different load impedance of the two pipe sections connected to the Scott-T transformer. The result is unbalance in the power system. The method of symmetrical components is applied to investigate the behavior during unbalanced loading of the Scott-transformer. The relationship between the negative- and the positive sequence component of the current is used to express the degree of unsymmetry. For the simulations in SIMPOW, the Scott-T transformer is modelled by the use of Dynamic Simulation Language. The simulations on the DSL model give correct and reliable results for analysing the the degree of unsymmetry in the Scott-T transformer. When the load impedance of one pipe section is varied, simulation proves that it can change between 0. 75 and 1. 34 per unit of the other pipe impedance. The Scott-T transformer does still provide electrical power between the two systems which is below the limit for the degree of unsymmetry (15 %). Case 1 and Case 2 introduce two possible configurations for a subsea DEH system with the Scott-T transformer implemented. The configurations include an onshore power supply which is connected to a subsea power system for direct electrical heating and a subsea load at the far end of the subsea cable. The pipeline in Case 1 is 100 km long and is divided into two pipe sections of 50 km which are connected to a Scott-T transformer. The pipeline in Case 2 is 200 km long and is divided into four pipe sections of 50 km each. There are two Scott-T transformers in Case 2. For normal operation of the subsea load (50 MW, cosfi= 0. 9) and heating the pipe content from the ambient sea emperature, the results indicate that tap changers are necessary to keep the Scott-T transformers secondary terminal voltage at 25 kV. This meets the requirement in both cases for heating the pipe content from 4 to 25 degrees celsius within 48 hours after a shutdown of the process. The degree of unsymmetry is zero for both cases when the system is operated as normal. However, all system simulations indicate that reactive power compensation has to be included for Case 1 as well as for Case 2 in order to have a power factor of unity at the onshore grid connection. The fault scenarios indicate that the degree of unsymmetry is dependent on both the type of fault and the power supply in the system. For Case 1, the relationship (I-/I+) is only of 3. 3 % in the subsea cable when there is a short-circuit at DEHBUS 3, but as much as 87 % at the grid connection. The degree of unsymmetry in the Scott-T transformer is then 67 %. This is far beyond the limit for maximum negative sequence component of 15 %. The significant unsymmetry in the line between the grid and BUS 1 is most likely due to the large power delivered to the fault. During the fault, the reactive power delivered to the system increases from 10. 6 Mvar to 131. 9 Mvar after the fault, but the active power increases only from 75. 2 MW to 87. 1 MW. This means that it is most likely the reactive power that contributes to the consequent unsymmetry and negative sequence component of the current. There are two Scott-T transformers installed in Case 2. If the DEH system is only heating the pipe section closest to shore (at DEHBUS 33), simulations show that the three-phase power system becomes unsymmetric which results in different phase currents. The degree of unsymmetry at the grid connection is 32 % when only the pipe section at DEHBUS 33 is heated. In addition, the unbalance in the three-phase system caused by SCOTT 1 involves unbalance in the SCOTT 2 transformer as well. The load voltages are not equal in magnitude and dephased of 90 degrees for this mode, but are 32 kV and 35 kV respectively and dephased of 88 degrees. This concludes a very important behavior of the Scott-T transformer. The simulations conclude that the Scott-T transformer provides symmetrical conditions for both configurations when the two load impedances are equal. However, Case 2 shows an important result when installing two Scott-T transformers in the same system. Unbalanced loading of one of the specially connected transformers gives unsymmetrical conditions in the three-phase system which results in unbalanced load voltages for the other Scott-T transformer. The analysis is limited to the configurations given for Case 1 and Case 2, but shows typical results when an alternative transformer connection is implemented in a DEH system. </p...|$|E
