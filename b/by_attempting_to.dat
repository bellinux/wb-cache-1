5|$|According to James, Anne {{wrote to}} him in 1696 {{requesting}} his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at a convenient opportunity; he declined to give his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> prevent a direct claim by James.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to check whether a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
5|$|Lasker {{challenged}} Siegbert Tarrasch, who had {{won three}} consecutive strong international tournaments (Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, and Dresden 1892), to a match. Tarrasch haughtily declined, stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> win one or two major international events.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. <b>By</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E

5|$|At this juncture, the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered {{to raise more}} troops, outraged the Batavi <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. The brutality and corruption of the Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Moltisanti becomes {{engaged to}} his girlfriend Adriana La Cerva. Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, two {{low-level}} associates dissatisfied with their perceived lack of success in the Soprano crew, {{try to make a}} name for themselves <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> kill Christopher. Their plan backfires; Christopher kills Sean and, though critically wounded, survives their attack. Tony and Big Pussy locate Matthew and assassinate him. However, a witness goes to the FBI and identifies Tony.|$|E
5|$|G-spot {{amplification}} (also called G-spot augmentation or the G-Shot) is {{a procedure}} intended to temporarily increase pleasure in sexually active women with normal sexual function, focusing on increasing {{the size and}} sensitivity of the G-spot. G-spot amplification is performed <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference. After numbing the area with a local anesthetic, human engineered collagen is then injected directly under the mucosa in the area the G-spot is concluded to be in.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{managers}} fail to readjust their capital structure {{in response to}} external stock returns. Thus, the typical firmâ€™s capital structure is not caused <b>by</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> time the market, <b>by</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> minimize taxes or bankruptcy costs, or <b>by</b> any other <b>attempts</b> at firm-value maximization. In-stead, capital structure is almost entirely determined by lagged stock returns (which, when applied to ancient equity values, predict current equity value and with it debt equity ratios). Consequently, one should conclude that capital structure is determined primarily by external stock market influences, and not by internal corporate optimizing decisions...|$|R

5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> make peace with the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, {{it is conceivable that}} the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to {{be divided into two}} Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
60|$|Appeals {{to their}} {{feelings}} {{as they rode}} through the field had been frequent, and their progress was much retarded <b>by</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the ease of a wounded or a dying man; but as the courier constantly urged speed, as {{the only means of}} securing the object of their ride, these halts were reluctantly abandoned.|$|R

5|$|In a plan {{to unite}} the employees, Michael unintentionally embarrasses {{overweight}} new employee Tony Gardner (Mike Bruner) <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> push him onto a table {{with the rest of}} the new employees, making the whole arrangement awry; this causes Tony to quit. However, an angered Michael fires him instead, also unintentionally entitling him to severance pay. When Michael learns that Jim is the No. 2 in the office, Dwight and Andy argue over who is No. 3. They find that they have a common interest: their apparent fondness towards Michael.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) distracts {{himself from}} his romantic {{problems}} <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> resolve a dispute between two janitors (Bawa and Ramsaywack). Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is offended when she learns that her employees hang out outside of work but do not invite her. This episode of 30 Rock closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity {{finished}} his MLB career with 246 career wins, seven 20-win seasons, and two 30-win seasons. He had nearly 500 professional wins including {{his years in}} the minor leagues. McGinnity set a career record in batters hit by pitch with 152. He revolutionized the fielding of the pitching position, <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> make force outs at any base, instead of only throwing the ball to first base.|$|E

5|$|Nicolls {{contributed to}} these post-war {{diplomatic}} {{tensions between the}} United Kingdom and the United States, <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> represent {{the interests of the}} Native Americans and blacks who had taken up arms on the British side. Prior to returning to Great Britain, Nicolls engaged in a heated exchange of letters with U.S. Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins. Hawkins accused Nicolls of being overzealous and of overstepping his authority in his personal defence of Redstick Creeks, Seminoles, and their Marron Creole allies, who some Americans in authority viewed as nothing more than runaway slaves and lost or unclaimed property.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1915, at Spina Khaisora (Tochi Valley) During {{operations}} against the Khostwal tribesmen, Captain Jotham, who was commanding {{a party of}} about a dozen of the North Waziristan Militia, was attacked in a nullah and almost surrounded by an overwhelming force of some 1,500 tribesmen. He gave the order to retire, and could have himself escaped, but most gallantly sacrificed his own life <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> effect the rescue of one of his men who had lost his horse.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event pitted Raven against P.J. Polaco. This match {{occurred}} because Raven refused to quit the company, which was something NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko had requested in the storyline. Since Raven refused to quit, Zbyszko forced him to wrestle Polaco. Cassidy Riley interfered in the match <b>by</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> aid Raven. The duration of the bout was 5 minutes and 45 seconds. Raven won the contest by forcing Polaco's head into the mat with his signature Even Flow DDT maneuver.|$|E
