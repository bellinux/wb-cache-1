They do not require specific treatment because they regress spontaneously in a few days. They often remain undiagnosed; other times, because of the pain they caused, they may worsen the nursing. CASE REPORT: We describe the clinical case of a healthy infant of 2 months, fed with formula, who has 2 aphthous lesions in the oral cavity associated with irritability and inconsolable crying during feeding. We excluded the influence of infectious factors or underlying diseases. The hypothesis of a traumatic factor {{was supported by the}} anatomical features of aphthae and then confirmed by the gradual resolution of lesions after some advices on breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our intent is to provide a photographic record of <b>Bednar</b> <b>aphthae,</b> which are quite common but often misdiagnosed also because of lacking of photographic material. Improved knowledge of this condition helps physicians in the differential diagnosis of a traumatic condition that is not as unusual as it seems in newborns...|$|E

500|$|An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a non {{specific}} term {{that refers to}} an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word aphtha meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as <b>aphthae,</b> including <b>Bednar's</b> <b>aphthae</b> (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants), oral candidiasis, and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.|$|R
