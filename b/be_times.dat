In 1793, during the war with revolutionary France, the Bank issued the first £5 note. Four years later, £1 and £2 notes appeared, although not on a permanent basis. Notes did not become entirely machine-printed and payable to the bearer until 1855.|$|E

25|$|Bound in Blood is a first-person shooter {{in which}} the player can control one of two characters; Ray McCall, or his brother Thomas. Whereas in the {{original}} Call of Juarez, the player controlled alternating characters from level to level, in Bound in Blood, most levels offer the player the choice of which character they wish to play as, with each character having a slightly different style of gameplay. The character which the player does not choose {{is controlled by the}} AI {{for the duration of the}} level. There are also occasional levels through which the player must play with a specific character. In many levels, there will <b>be</b> <b>times</b> where the brothers will have to directly help one another, such as Thomas helping Ray to reach a high platform, or Ray kicking down a door for Thomas. Most levels are played through in the same manner, irrespective of which character is chosen, with the only difference being that of style. Occasionally, however, the brothers will separate within a level, and, as such, the level design will be different depending on which character the player is using.|$|E
500|$|The league did not {{institute}} a seeding {{system for the}} playoffs until 1975, where the surviving clubs with the higher seeds were made the home teams for each playoff round. [...] Thus, the top seeded division winner played the wild-card team, and the remaining two division winners played at the home stadium of the better seed (which meant that the lowest-seeded division winner had to open the postseason on the road). However, two teams from the same division could not meet prior to the conference championship game. Thus, there would <b>be</b> <b>times</b> when the pairing in the divisional playoff round would be the 1 seed vs. the 3 seed and 2 vs. 4.|$|E

Charles Cotesworth Pinckney moved that the states vote and the prohibition carried by vote of 8 states to 3. Robert Yates noted that the clause [...] "which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased" [...] was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place much faith in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created. Madison moved that the phrase [...] "or the Emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter." [...] This motion failed 2–8, with one state divided. The clause was limited to [...] "civil" [...] offices so as not to restrict military service. Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.|$|E

Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd <b>be</b> <b>times</b> when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff {{that was out of}} tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] The first day I tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play.

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to <b>be</b> <b>times</b> when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may <b>be</b> <b>times</b> in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E

The woman does not want a people-seed to root itself in her house, and so she even takes the measure to protect herself with the best mesh screens, and then voluntarily opens the windows. However, {{in the event that}} one people-seed finds its way through her window screens, unwelcome as it may be, does the simple fact that the woman knowingly risked such an occurrence when opening her window deny her the ability to rid her house of the intruder? [...] Thomson notes that some may argue the affirmative to this question, claiming that [...] "...after all you could have lived out your life with bare floors and furniture, or with sealed windows and doors". But by this logic, she says, any woman could avoid pregnancy due to rape by simply having a hysterectomy – an extreme procedure simply to safeguard against such a possibility. [...] Thomson concludes that although there may <b>be</b> <b>times</b> when the fetus does have a right to the mother's body, certainly in most cases the fetus does not have a right to the mother's body.

LeMay {{was considered}} {{instrumental in the}} establishment in 1947 of the United States Air Force and an expert in military affairs. His four-star military rank, experience at Strategic Air Command and presence advising President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis were considered foreign-policy assets to the Wallace campaign. By 1968, LeMay had retired and was serving {{as chairman of the}} board of an electronics company, but the company threatened to dismiss him if he took a leave of absence to run for vice president. To keep LeMay on the ticket, Wallace backer and Texas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt set up a million-dollar fund to reimburse LeMay for any income lost in the campaign. Campaign aides tried to persuade LeMay to avoid questions relating to nuclear weapons, but when asked if he thought their use was necessary to win the Vietnam War, he first said that America can win in Vietnam without them. [...] However, he alarmed the audience by further commenting, [...] "we [...] have a phobia about nuclear weapons. [...] I think there may <b>be</b> <b>times</b> when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons." [...] The [...] "politically tone-deaf" [...] LeMay became a drag on Wallace's candidacy for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so that there will <b>be</b> <b>times</b> when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can clear your mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations [...] It's {{a lot of fun}} despite the burden of the camera system and other technical glitches. It doesn't, nor should it, replace Grand Theft Auto by any means. True Crime has enough good to counter the bad and stand on its own." [...] Boulding and Tom McNamara scored the PC version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the multiplayer that many of us have been salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget." [...] They were also critical of the controls and graphics, concluding [...] "the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs. Plus, multiplayer, the hot magnet exclusive to the PC version, is decidedly half-baked." ...|$|E
