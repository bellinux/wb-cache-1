40|$|The development, production, {{and use of}} costeffective aquatic feeds, {{whether in}} the form of live natural food organisms or {{manufactured}} compound aquafeeds, is central to the successful operation of all intensive aquaculture systems, including the production of marine ornamentals. A 49 day feeding trial was conducted using two test diets (bio-enriched feed with carotene and bio-enriched feed without carotene) and a control diet in the hatchery produced 90 days old juveniles of false clown fish Amphiprion ocellaris. Mixed oil cakes and wheat flour (soybean meal: wheat flour: groundnut oilcake: sesame oil cake; 4 : 3 : 2 : 1) fermented for 72 h using a phytase producing bacterial strain Bacillus licheniformis MTCC 6824 isolated from mangrove swamp was used for <b>bio-enrichment...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Cu 2 + on acute {{toxicity}} and tissue copper accumulation in juvenile qingbo, Spinibarbus sinensis, were measured. The {{results showed that}} the fish lethal rate rose with the increased of copper concentration and exposure time (p＜ 0. 05). The relationship between lethal rate and exposure time showed “S”-type logic regression curve. After exposed over 96, 120, 144 and 168 h, the copper concentration lethal for 50 % (LC 50) of the fish were 0. 500, 0. 401, 0. 356 and 0. 352 mg·L- 1, respectively. The safe concentration of Cu 2 + was 0. 050 mg·L- 1. Exposed the fish to 0. 4 、 0. 6 、 0. 8 、 1. 0 、 1. 2 、 1. 4 mg·L- 1, the exposure time lethal for 50 % (LT 50) of the fish were 116. 0, 78. 0, 80. 7, 56. 0, 46. 7 and 46. 0 h, respectively. Accumulation of copper in tissues was highest in liver, followed by gill, and the lowest in muscle. The values of the <b>bio-enrichment</b> coefficient suggested that acute copper exposure was not sufficient to generate strong enrichment effect on fish. Taken together, all of results indicated that copper concentration in water could impact on the survival rate significantly while not on the copper accumulation in tissues of juvenile qingbo, Spinibarbus sinensis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dynamics of {{vegetation}} and soil properties responses to vegetation {{recovery in the}} selected 72 Karst desertification sites in Guizhou, China were studied. Six typical and representative vegetation types along a chronosequence {{of vegetation}} recovery (corn land, sparse grass, regeneration forest, shrub, grass and shrub, and native forest with 0, 3 - 5, 10 - 15, 20 - 30, 30 - 40, and> 100 yrs, respectively) were selected {{for the study of}} the plant species, vegetation features as well as soil physical & chemical properties in order to assess interaction between soil properties and vegetation structure. It was found that vegetation species had dry-resistant characteristics because of their extensive exposure to the basement rocks and thinness soil. Grass community was always coarse grass, shrub was generally dominated by vines, thorn bushes and tree species were almost leather-like, single and mini-type leaf plants. Factor analysis showed that the 3 factors, soil fertility, pH and clay, explain 67. 97 % of total variance among the 19 soil property parameters. Soil fertility changed significantly effects included the increasing of soil organic matter, total and available nitrogen, humic acid, CEC, fuvic acid, exchange Ca, porosity and total P but decreasing bulk density. This trend was followed by enhancing of <b>bio-enrichment</b> capacity along the chronosequence of vegetation recovering process. Soil pH had no significant correlation with the vegetation recovery stages because it was determined by soil forming process and characteristic of parent materials. The factor clay only decreased slightly in the recovery stages. Cluster analysis indicated that vegetation structure could develop within short time under anthropocentric interfering, but soil fertility only accumulated with annual litter decomposing. We can conclude that recovery of vegetation community structure proceeded restoration of soil function...|$|E
