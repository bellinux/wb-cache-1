40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a time-domain {{analysis}} method based on probability density estimation is presented for rotating machine fault detection. Generally, the vibration signals {{obtained from a}} rotating machine are time-variant since they are strongly related to the rotational speed that is not constant even in the macro steady state. Since the mostly used signal processing method, the Fourier analysis is only suitable for stationary signals, {{the development of the}} joint time-frequency analysis is demanded. Here, the probability density estimation method based on Parzen window is introduced. The probability density function of the vibration signal of the rotating machine is estimated by Parzen window, and a threshold valueα is predefined to decide the state of the rotating machine. By inspecting the change of the probability density of the vibration signal, the condition of the machine is monitored. Air gap eccentricity and <b>ball</b> <b>cage</b> broken bearing are considered in the experiment section, they are difficult to be detected in frequency domain while the rotating speed is not constant.

The significant application of the SPC analysis elements to the operation will make the process more reliable and stable. For the case study, bearing manufacturing process were selected. Bearing is one of important part in mechanical devices. A complete bearing consist of outer ring, steel <b>ball,</b> <b>cage,</b> metallic shield and inner ring. The dimensions of the bearing components are must control tight to its tolerance to ensure the bearing fit to its clearance. To ensure the process is under the production control statistical process control (SPC) methods are being used. To converge the study on SPC application on the bearing manufacturing processes, a visit to SKF Bearing Industries (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. has been made. The case study was done on bearing product number 6206 - 2 Z. The bearings outer ring manufacturing processes were take into consideration. Each processes of the outer ring making were observed carefully. The quality control (QC) data were obtained from SKF and further analysis on the data was done manually and by using MINITAB software. The analyzed data were compared and the root problems and errors were identified. The problems are further discussed and some recommendations were made to make the process more efficient. In the bearing industry, bearings outer ring making operation is on of the critical process. Significant differences in dimension and deviation from the parts tolerance will make the bearing produced is rejected or categories as low quality bearing. A class 1 bearing will have tight clearance. Statistical process control will monitor the processes and magnifies the small deviations of the process from the actual control limits. Thus, the manufacturing processes can be controlled directly and good bearing which meets all the specifications can be produced...|$|E
40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{technology}} {{allows the}} fabrication of small mechanical systems in silicon using standard micro-fabrication pro- cesses. MEMS techniques have found wide acceptance in such devices as ac- celerometers, micro-mirrors, resonators, probes, and micro-tweezers {{to name a}} few. Though small linear motions are common in MEMS applications, few devices exhibit reliable rotary motion. This work explores several methods of fabricating rotary bearings using micro-balls as the support mechanism. Micro-ball bearings have several advantages over other MEMS bearing tech- nologies in that they provide robust mechanical support, require no external control systems, and basic designs require very few fabrication steps. Ball cages or retainers are common in macro-scale bearings, providing uniform spacing between the balls. Several cage designs are proposed and explored in this work: a radial ball bearing with an integrated <b>ball</b> <b>cage,</b> a dual-row style cage, and ve unique cage geometries integrated into silicon micro-turbines (SMTs.) Also, {{an example of a}} curved or angular contact race- way is presented as an example of this type of raceway geometry in MEMS devices. Each is presented with a discussion of the design considerations and fabrication process. This is followed by a characterization of the performance of each design. These studies found that the integrated cage in the radial ball bearing performs well at speeds ranging up to 20 000 RPM. Minimal wear was ob- served after 6 hours of continuous testing. However, the solder bond in the cage was a common failure point in these devices, limiting the reliability and longevity. The dual groove style cage was designed to eliminate the solder bond. However, the higher frictional forces between the ball and the cage in this design resulted in higher losses during operation. Taking into account the higher losses and the added complexity of the design, it seems unlikely that this approach would be appropriate for further study. However, the design does represent a novel approach for releasing multi-wafer rotary structures and is presented here as example of this technique. Testing of the cage de- signs for the SMTs indicated that a full ring design (a full annulus with holes for the balls) performed the best of the 5 cage geometries. However, these devices do not perform as well as cage-less designs for high speed applications due to higher ctional forces and increased raceway wear at the interface be- tween the ball and the raceway edge. Finally, the curved raceway has shown excellent performance up to 2500 RPM with normal loads up to 40 mN in tribometer testing. SMTs with this raceway desing were also tested for over 10 million revolutions and at speeds over 70 000 RPM. The test results for all of the bearings designs presented here show that the devices exhibit stable operation at low to moderately high speeds. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of {{angular contact ball bearing}} rotor system, and to develop a coupled dynamic model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a test rig was designed and developed to operate at speeds up to 70, 000 rpm. The rotating components (i. e. turbine wheels) of the TTR were made to be dynamically similar to the actual turbocharger. Proximity sensors were used to record the turbine wheel displacements while accelerometers were used to monitor the rotor vibrations. A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was specifically designed and developed to monitor the bearing internal operating temperature. The TTR was used to examine the dynamic response of the turbocharger under normal and extreme operating conditions. To achieve the objectives of analytical investigation, a discrete element ball bearing model was coupled through a set of interface points with a component mode synthesis rotor model to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. Displacements of the rotor from the analytical model were corroborated with experimental results. The analytical and experimental results are in good agreement. The bearing rotor system model was used to examine the bearing component dynamics. Effects of preloading and imbalance were also found to have significant effects on turbocharger rotor and bearing dynamics. ^ The dynamic bearing model was also modified to include the influence of cage flexibility on the force and motions of bearing components (i. e. inner and outer races, and balls). In order to achieve the objectives, a cage model based on the explicit finite element method was developed and combined with a discrete element dynamic bearing model. In this modeling approach, all bearing components, including the flexible cage have 6 degrees of freedom. The 3 D explicit finite element approach allows the cage model to elastically deform as the balls impact cage pockets. The ball inner and outer race contacts are modeled using Hertzian equations, while a separate contact algorithm was developed to determine the interacting forces between the cage finite element mesh and discrete bearing components. The discrete and finite element models interact at each time step to determine the position, velocity, acceleration and forces of all bearing components. The <b>ball</b> <b>cage</b> contact forces are used to determine the deformation and stresses generated within the cage. The model results were corroborated with previous experimental results as well as the traditional analytical cage models. The results from the current FEA cage model matched the known cage motion traits observed by previous investigators. However, further investigation using the current model demonstrates that cage flexibility/deflection has a considerable effect on the overall dynamics of the bearing, in particular the ball-cage contact forces. Also, the resulting cage deformation and stress helps to identify the effect of operating and loading conditions on cage stress distribution. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMore than 300 {{epicardial}} Doppler color flow mapping {{studies on}} 23 {{different types of}} clinical and preclinical valves were performed after implantation in the mitral position in sheep. The transducers were placed directly on the heart to obtain the greatest possible resolution. Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of <b>ball</b> and <b>cage</b> valves, 3 types of disc and cage valves, 7 types of tilting disc valves, 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. <b>Ball</b> and <b>cage</b> and disc and cage valves had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting disc valves had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1. 5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter). These observations are similar and complementary to those obtained by in vitro flow visualization techniques and those obtained by laser Doppler anemometry.
