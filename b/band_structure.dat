5|$|The term {{metalloid}} originally {{referred to}} nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, {{as a category}} of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term semimetal has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry. In physics it more specifically refers to the electronic <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> of a substance.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic <b>band</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of a Ni– 18 wt. % Fe electrodeposits {{having a}} <b>banded</b> <b>structure</b> {{is described in}} detail. The aim is to investigate {{the influence of the}} <b>banded</b> <b>structure</b> on grain growth behaviour and texture and to elucidate if there are other mechanisms operative in the stabilization of nanocrystalline electrodeposits. Spectroscopy techniques have been used to characterize the variations in alloy/impurity concentration perpendicular to the growth direction. The influence of these chemical variations on the microstructural evolution has been monitored by in-situ annealing treatments in the TEM. Local texture of the annealed material has been determined by use of the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. SEM and TEM investigations have shown that the <b>banded</b> <b>structure</b> is not related to phase changes and that grain growth is not affected by the <b>banded</b> <b>structure,</b> i. e. there is no preferred growth along bands.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study on the}} <b>band</b> <b>structures</b> of the electron constrained to move along triply-periodic minimal surfaces.

Phys. I France 3, 839 (1993) ] is used {{to prove that the}} eigenstates for these surfaces are interrelated at a set of special points in the Brillouin zones.

A numerical investigation of the <b>band</b> <b>structures</b> as well as a detailed analysis on their symmetry properties is presented.

5|$|The <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> {{of carbon}} {{nanotubes}} having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century {{it has been used}} to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid, and suggested using the term semimetal instead. Use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a different meaning in physics—one that more specifically refers to the electronic <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semimetal.|$|E

25|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, {{the electronic}} <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> (or simply <b>band</b> <b>structure)</b> {{of a solid}} describes the range of energies that an electron within the solid may have (called energy bands, allowed bands, or simply bands) and ranges of energy {{that it may not}} have (called band gaps or forbidden bands).|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} how <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> changes {{relative to the}} Fermi level in real space, a <b>band</b> <b>structure</b> plot is often first simplified {{in the form of}} a band diagram.
