In the late 1960s and early 1970s many other companies produced competition for Action Man, but all were of the cheap <b>blow-moulded</b> variety, which produces thin-walled components lacking the articulation and sturdiness of the Palitoy components, which utilised more costly Injection and Rotational moulding processes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Blow {{moulding}} is {{the forming}} of a hollow part by `blowing ’ a mould cavity shaped parison {{made by a}} thermoplastic molten tube. <b>Blow-moulded</b> parts often require strict control of the thickness distribution {{in order to achieve}} the required mechanical performance and ®nal weight. A fuzzy optimization algorithm for determining the optimal die gap openings and die geometry for the required thickness distribution in the blow moulding process is presented. The idea of the fuzzy optimization algorithm is that, instead of using purely numerical information to obtain the new design point in the next iteration, engineering knowledge and the human supervision process can be modelled in the optimization algorithm using fuzzy rules. The structure of an optimization algorithm is still maintained to guide the engineering decision process and to ensure that an optimal solution rather than a trial and error solution can be obtained. It is shown how a single fuzzy engine can be used in various cases and types of optimization of the blow moulding process...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the drop impact test for moulded plastics containers, {{as a first step}} towards the simulation of the impact event for design and development purposes. Experimental data are analysed from instrumented base drop impact testing of water-filled <b>blow-moulded</b> bottles, 20 and 210 l drums. Each type of container is found to exhibit a characteristic pulse time for the internal pressure during impact. Analysis shows that the observed behaviour of the flexible container/water-filled system is normally best described in terms of solid body dynamics, rather than an approach based on water hammer concepts. A simple equivalent mass–spring model is developed which predicts the characteristic pulse time and pressure distribution {{on the walls of the}} vessel throughout the impact test. It is shown that this model should be applied when the length of the vessel does not exceed a critical length. An expression for determining this critical length is given. Loads and loading rates predicted by the mass–spring model can be used as input to a simplified FEM simulation of the drop impact test on any vessel...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The conference {{was held on}} 29 October - 01 November 2013. A South African {{entrepreneur}} needed a fast and accurate route to consumer testing for a design of phlegm collection bottle for long-distance runners. Vaal University of Technology was presented with an initial product concept {{which had to be}} developed into a fully functional prototype required for field trials. The idea was converted into a practical product proposal and modelled using a 3 D computer aided design (CAD) system. The CAD data were used for laser sintering of polyamide to produce an initial prototype for appearance and ergonomic evaluation. For product testing in the field, a short run of fully functional prototypes in thin-walled low density poly-ethylene (LDPE) was required. This required a further design iteration and the production of tooling for the blow moulding process. A novel hybrid modular approach to tool manufacture was followed, where the outer frame of the tools were machined in aluminium and the tool inserts were laser sintered in AlumideTM. Blow moulding trials were undertaken in LDPE which revealed a number of positive and negative issues. The rough surface of the tool inserts produced a desirable textured surface in the resultant <b>blow-moulded</b> bottles but also prevented a clean “shut-off” between the two halves of the tool. This allowed air to escape from the cavity along the split plane, creating unwanted holes in the bottles. In addition, the low thermal conductivity of AlumideTM resulted in an unwanted overheating of the tools. Strategies were identified to overcome these issues and these are explained in the paper...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{non-linear}} formulation of 4 -node axisymmetric hyperelastic solid model, based {{on the concept of}} SFR (Space Fiber Rotation). The SFRaxi model uses the kinematics of a space fibre to obtain an enriched displacement field. It improves in a significant way the precision of the classical 4 -node axi- symmetrical element Q 4 axi. The corresponding results are comparable and even better in term of time CPU, with those of the higher order Q 8 axi element. A hyperelastic behaviour law based on the Mooney-Rivlin approach has been implemented allowing better simulations of <b>blow-moulding</b> and thermoforming of hollow plastic bodies. The numerical results, very promising, are mainly focused on some plastic forming tests without contact (swellings) ...|$|R
30|$|First, {{the usual}} {{assignment}} of setup costs and times to products does not realistically reflect the changeover processes prevalent in advanced manufacturing technology. In {{a great number}} of industrial settings, we observed that setup conditions are related to the processing mode of the production equipment rather than to individual product types. Hence, the common assignment of setup costs and times to individual products appears to be questionable since setup costs are often caused by changing the basic processing mode and not for switching between different product types. As an example, consider the bottling of beverages (see the case-based example in Sect. 5.1) where stretch <b>blow-moulding</b> machines are set up for a specific type of plastic bottles by mounting the required moulds into the processing head of the machine. Once the machine is set up for a specific type of bottle, a variety of beverages can be bottled with only a minor changeover between the different product types. Therefore, the definition of lot sizes should primarily refer to the retention of a basic setup condition of the production equipment instead to the production quantity of an individual item.|$|R
30|$|In many {{industrial}} production settings, e.g. in the beverage industry, setup conditions are considerably complex and {{the assignment of}} setup costs and times to a specific product may become a difficult task. As an example, consider <b>blow-moulding</b> machines which represent the recent technology for bottling of beverages like mineral water or fruit juices. This kind of machinery is set up for a specific shape and size of plastic bottles by mounting the required moulds into the processing head of the machine. The actual plastic bottles are formed on the machine from compact pre-forms through thermal and high-air pressure processes. Depending on {{the configuration of the}} machine, around 20 moulding devices are arranged on a rotary turret thus allowing a respective number of bottles to be produced on the fly. Due to the high-pressure filling capabilities of the machine, 15 – 20, 000 plastic bottles of one-litre size can be filled per hour. Auxiliary equipment for bottle washing, capping and labelling is integrated into the line as well as packaging machines for the generation of unit loads used in retail stores or transportation. Once the line is set up for a specific type of bottle, a variety of beverages can be filled with only a minor changeover between the different product types.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{experimental}} {{investigation into the}} strain-induced crystalline microstructure, under biaxial elongation in Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The aim of our study is to achieve both mechanical tests representative from the <b>blow-moulding</b> process, and micro- structural measurements. We therefore examine how the microstructure of a polymer subjected to a complex strain field evolves {{in terms of its}} crystalline ratio, its molecular orientation and the size of its crystallites. PET injection-moulded thick specimens were subjected to bi-axial elongation tests, both equibiaxial and sequential, using several elongation speeds, draw ratios and temperatures (above and close to Tg). The strain field was determined using a home-developed image correlation technique that allowed us to identify all the strain components at each point of the specimen, even when the strain field was not homogeneous. After the completion of the strain path, the specimens were either quenched at room temperature or cooled down very quickly using liquid nitrogen, in order to dissociate the contribution of stretching from that of relaxation. Microstructure observations were achieved by means of differential densimetry and WAXD (Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction) using a synchrotron beam. The results obtained confirm the strong link between the stress tensor and the crystals orientation and the crucial influence of molecular orientation on final microstructure (crystalinity ratio, crystals morphology) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the premise that ceramics might sometimes profitably be shaped using techniques more traditionally associated with metals and plastics, particularly forging of solids and extrusion of liquids. This firstly required that the high temperature formability of ceramics be known. Existing forming and associated testing techniques were therefore surveyed, establishing short-comings and pointing to areas requiring new techniques. Plastic deformation mechanisms of principal simple ceramics were reviewed to determine the scope of novel techniques required, and to show evidence of suitability for forming. Emphasis {{was given to the}} deformation behaviour of alumina, the ceramic chosen for experimental investigation. Five rigs were constructed for an experimental schedule in three phases: (I) two furnaces and one press were used to study the compatibility of alumina with graphite, tantalum, tungsten and molybdenum under forming conditions. Some original microhardness values for carbides were measured. Observations were made of graphite's spectral emissivity. Sensitive temperature control was achieved. ii) a special melting unit was developed for inflating molten alumina to form hollow spheres, resembling <b>blow-moulding</b> of glass and plastics. Thermal endurances of tungsten heaters in vacuo, in argon and in molten alumina were studied. Heat transfer through sintered and powder alumina was measured. The spectral emissivity of sintered alumina was found. The freezing contraction of molten alumina, and the contact angle with tungsten were found accurately using a novel technique with possible wide application. iii) a multipurpose rig with tungsten tooling was constructed for tests of alternating drivedown - stress relaxation, compressive creep, and forging on recrystallised alumina. The experiments gave information on forgeability, ductility above 1150 C, crack healing, tertiary creep rate, pore distribution effect on steady state creep rate, and pore closing contribution to deformation. It was concluded that forging and liquid extrusion of alumina is feasible and is sometimes preferable to traditional shaping methods...|$|R
