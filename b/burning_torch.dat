5|$|The current school {{crest of}} Hwa Chong Institution, is {{in a form}} of the {{traditional}} Chinese character “學” (xué), which literally meant to learn. The crest, with a red background, also bears much similarity to a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> of passion.|$|E
5|$|Samson went out, {{gathered}} 300 foxes, {{and tied}} {{them together in}} pairs by their tails. He then attached a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> to each pair of foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why Samson burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mosaic}} the Biblical Samson is portrayed tying <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> to the tails of foxes, {{this is from}} a Bible story in the Book of Judges in which during a war with the Philistines Samson catches 300 wild foxes, ties <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> to their tails and sets them loose to set fire to Philistine grain fields. It is flanked by two human faces and a Hebrew {{inscription}} referring to rewards for those who perform good deeds.|$|R
50|$|During most {{of their}} history, silversmiths used {{charcoal}} or coke fired forges, and lung-powered blow-pipes for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.|$|R
50|$|During the Panquetzaliztli ceremony, Xiuhcoatl was {{represented}} by a paper serpent with red feathers emerging from its open maw to represent flames. During the ceremony, <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> also symbolised Xiuhcoatl and a serpent dance was performed.|$|R
25|$|In 1884, a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> {{was added}} to the {{insignia}} and the present design adopted on 1 July 1884.|$|E
25|$|During {{the evening}} of 23 May 1970 the bridge was heavily damaged when boys playing inside the bridge dropped a <b>burning</b> <b>torch,</b> setting alight the tar-coated wooden roof of the tubes. Despite {{the best efforts of}} the Caernarfonshire and Anglesey fire brigades, the bridge's height, construction, and the lack of an {{adequate}} water supply meant they were unable to control the fire, which spread all the way across from the mainland to the Anglesey side. After the fire had burned itself out the bridge was still standing, but the structural integrity of the iron tubes had been critically compromised by the intense heat. As a consequence the bridge, except for the original stone substructure, was completely rebuilt by Husband & Co.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{the seal}} was {{a variant of}} the 1868-1935 {{official}} seal (a cardioid shield with an orb and cross, the hound with the <b>burning</b> <b>torch,</b> and directly below the sun of St. Thomas Aquinas whose rays extend throughout the whole of the seal). The seal then consisted of a white field with four ovals arranged in a [...] "T" [...] fashion, featuring the coats of arms of the Republic of the Philippines to the left, the Holy See in the center, of Spain (only the arms without the Pillas of Hercules) to the right; and below the Holy See oval that of the Dominican Order, surrounded by a rosary, crowned by a star ("St. Dominic's star"), and flanked by a palm branch (representing martyrdom) to its left and white lilies to the right. All these symbolize the University as Pontifical, Dominican, & Spanish in origin, as well as being established in and under the laws of the Philippines. The upper half of the seal is flanked by laurel leaves on both sides and the lower half by the collar-chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece, symbolizing the University as Royal. The inner border of the seal is lined with the Latin name of the University (Pontificia et Regalis S(ancti) Thomæ Aquinatis Universitas Manilana).|$|E

50|$|In 1939, the Voortekkers {{took part}} in the laying of the {{foundation}} stone at the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria. This event was widely celebrated by Voortrekkers and other Afrikaners, who walked with <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> in many locations in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Alector residences and {{official}} buildings were commonly lit by steady <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> that exploited {{small amounts of}} life force to create light. Although not particularly greedy of life force, such devices were reserved to Alectors only, at least during the earliest portions of their reign.|$|R
2500|$|Also in 1943, a new five-cent {{piece was}} introduced. Due to the {{shortages}} of nickel, owing to its use for munitions, the Royal Canadian Mint adopted tombac, {{a type of}} brass for the five-cent piece. The composition of tombac was [...]880 copper and [...]120 zinc. The coin was twelve-sided, so that the public could easily distinguish it from the bronze cent. [...] Rather than the traditional beaver, the patriotic V for Victory (made famous by Winston Churchill) and a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> were now used. The coin was designed by Thomas Shingles, the Chief Engraver for the Royal Canadian Mint, and the coin’s rim holds a message in Morse Code that states: [...] "We win when we work willingly." ...|$|E
2500|$|May 2007: Right-wing Jews ascend the Mount: A {{group of}} right-wing Religious Zionist rabbis entered the Temple Mount. This {{elicited}} widespread criticism from other religious Jews and from secular Israelis, accusing the rabbis of provoking the Arabs. An {{editorial in the}} newspaper Haaretz accused the rabbis of 'knowingly and irresponsibly bringing a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> closer to the most flammable hill in the Middle East,' and noted that rabbinical consensus in both the Haredi and the Religious Zionist worlds forbids Jews from entering the Temple Mount. On May 16, Rabbi Avraham Shapira, former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel and rosh yeshiva of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, reiterated his opinion that it is forbidden for Jews to enter the Temple Mount. The Litvish Haredi newspaper Yated Ne'eman, which is controlled by leading Litvish Haredi rabbis including Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, accused the rabbis of transgressing a decree punishable by 'death through the hands of heaven.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Montresor reveals {{brick and}} mortar, {{previously}} hidden among the bones nearby, {{and proceeds to}} wall up the niche using his trowel, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend {{that he is the}} subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As Montresor finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, [...] "For the love of God, Montresor!" [...] to which Montresor replies, [...] "Yes, for the love of God!" [...] He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs.|$|E
50|$|According to Pausanias, in 688 BC {{the city}} of Hyperesia was {{threatened}} by an army from Sicyon. The locals defended their city by placing <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> on their goats' (aiges in Greek) horns. The Sicyonians retreated and the Hyperesians renamed their town Aigeira (Greek: Aίγειρα) to honor the goats.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} a special type of {{physical}} exercise termed as torchlight is a special highlight of the school. Since 1904 CE it {{is included in the}} annual sports in which <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> are used to perform a scenic synchronised exercise. In 1928 D.V. Beatson added the Beatson exercise.|$|R

60|$|The dew {{was falling}} pure to the {{polluted}} earth; the light breezes sang their low daybreak anthem among the leaves to the Power that bade them forth; night had expired, and morning was already born of it, as Vetranio, with the <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> in his hand, advanced towards the funeral pile.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the last}} moment the woman in La had triumphed over the High Priestess of a cruel cult. She saw upon the altar the only {{creature}} that ever had aroused the fires of love within her virgin breast; she saw the beast-faced fanatic who {{would one day be}} her mate, unless she found another less repulsive, standing with the <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> ready to ignite the pyre; yet with all her mad passion for the ape-man she would give the word to apply the flame if Tarzan's final answer was unsatisfactory.

6000|$|One {{night the}} prince {{returned}} after a longer chase than usual, {{and he was}} so tired that he went up straight to bed. Suddenly he was awakened by a strange noise in the room, and suspecting that a robber might have stolen in, he jumped out of bed, and seized his sword, which lay ready to his hand. Then he perceived that the noise proceeded from the next room, which belonged to the princess, and was lighted by a <b>burning</b> <b>torch.</b> Creeping softly to the door, he peeped through it, and beheld her lying quietly, with a crown of gold and pearls upon her head, her wrinkles all gone, and her face, which was whiter than the snow, as fresh as that of a girl of fourteen. Could that really be his wife--that beautiful, beautiful creature? ...|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{settled in the}} 3rd {{millennium}} BC. The city was known as Hyperesia (Greek: Υπερησία, Hyperesia) during Homeric times. According to Pausanias, in 688 BC Hyperesia was threatened by a hostile army from Sicyon. The locals defended their city by placing <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> on their goats' (aiges in Greek) horns. As a result, the invaders left in fear while the Hyperesians renamed their town Αigeira to honor the goats.|$|R

25|$|Gunfire was {{exchanged}} {{over the}} next several days. After the initial flurry of shooting, Boone—who reemerged as the natural leader even though as a captain he was outranked by Major Smith and Colonel Richard Callaway—urged the Kentuckians to conserve their gunpowder. At night, Native Americans ran up to the walls and attempted to throw <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> onto the roofs of the houses within. This was ineffective, however, because the warriors made easy targets for the Kentucky marksmen.|$|R
60|$|It was {{believed}} {{that she had the}} magical power of healing wounded men, however sorely they were hurt. Paris and Oenone lived most happily together in the forest; but one day, when the servants of Priam had driven off a beautiful bull that was in the herd of Paris, he left the hills to seek it, and came into the town of Troy. His mother, Hecuba, saw him, and looking at him closely, perceived that he wore a ring which she had tied round her baby's neck when he was taken away from her soon after his birth. Then Hecuba, beholding him so beautiful, and knowing him to be her son, wept for joy, and they all forgot the prophecy that he would be a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> of fire, and Priam gave him a house like those of his brothers, the Trojan princes.|$|E
60|$|The sun had set, but {{the moon}} was at full, and the {{travellers}} determined to go forward at once. It was agreed that every one should carry a bundle of sticks on his shoulders, also a stout cudgel or staff; that they should march close in rows of four, with Thimble's litter in their midst; and that the Mulgar at each corner should carry a <b>burning</b> <b>torch.</b> They made what haste they could to tie up their bundles, bottles, and faggots, so as to lose nothing of the moon's brilliance during the long night. She rode unclouded above the snow-fields when the little band of Mulgar-travellers set out. As {{soon as they were}} gone, down trooped the long-nosed Obobbomans to the fire, sniffing and scuffling, to fall asleep at last, higgledy-piggledy, in a great squirrel-coloured ring around the glowing embers, their noses towards the fire.|$|E
6000|$|Kipps made a {{confused}} reply {{that took the}} form of not minding if he did, and drank another sip of old Methusaleh in his confusion. He was able to follow the subsequent course of that sip for quite a long way. It was as though the old gentleman was brandishing a <b>burning</b> <b>torch</b> through his vitals, lighting him here and lighting him there until at last his whole being was in a glow. Chitterlow produced a tobacco pouch and cigarette papers and with an interesting parenthesis that was a little difficult to follow about some lady named Kitty something or other who had taught him the art when he was as yet only what you might call a nice boy, made Kipps a cigarette, and with a consideration that won Kipps' gratitude suggested that after all he might find a little soda water an improvement with the whiskey. [...] "Some people like it that way," [...] said Chitterlow, and then with voluminous emphasis, [...] "I don't." ...|$|E
50|$|A non-violent slave revolt in 1848 {{proved more}} successful. The {{governor}} at the time, Peter von Scholten, faced {{with thousands of}} enslaved Africans with <b>burning</b> <b>torches</b> threatening to burn down the town of Frederiksted, freed the slaves, even though the Danish Crown had so far intended that the last slaves would be emancipated in 1859. Von Scholten would later be summoned before a commission of enquiry for his action and deprived of his pension but he was eventually exonerated by the Supreme Court.|$|R

50|$|A Kuchipudi {{performance}} traditionally is a night performance, when rural families {{return from}} their farms and {{are free of}} their daily work. It has been performed in or next to a Hindu temple, and the stage lit by the yellow lights of castor oil <b>burning</b> <b>torches.</b> The dance-drama begins with an invocation (melavimpu, puvaranga). This may be an on stage prayer to Ganesha, the Hindu god of good beginnings, or may be an invocation expressing reverence to various Hindu gods, goddesses, earth, or one's guru (teacher).|$|R
