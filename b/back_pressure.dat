5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E

50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or {{molecular}} drag pump) {{as their}} last stage {{to increase the}} maximum <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> (exhaust pressure) to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} <b>back</b> to atmospheric <b>pressure</b> directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|R
40|$|The energy {{absorption}} efficiency of high-intensity (similar to 10 (16) W/cm(2)) femtosecond laser pulses in a dense jet of large rare-gas clusters has been measured. Experimental {{results show that}} the {{energy absorption}} efficiency is strongly dependent on the cluster size and can be higher than 90 %. The measurement of the ion energy indicates that the average ion energies of argon and xenon can be as high as 90 and 100 keV, respectively. The dependence of the average energy of the ions on the cluster size is also measured. At comparatively low gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure,</b> the average ion energies of argon and xenon increase with increasing gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The average ion energy of argon becomes saturated gradually with further increase of the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure.</b> For xenon, the average ion energy drops a little after the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> exceeds 9 bar (3. 2 x 10 (5) atoms/cluster).

In an experimental investigation of the relation between neutral gas density and <b>backing</b> <b>pressure,</b> it is found that the resulting number density for helium is ∼ 30 % higher than for hydrogen at the same <b>backing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The observed differences in electron beam properties between the two gases can thus be explained by differences in plasma electron density. This interpretation is verified by repeating the laser wakefield acceleration experiment using similar plasma electron densities for the two gases, which then yielded electron beams with similar properties...|$|R

Smoke deflectors were fitted the following month to compensate for the reduced uplift of smoke from the redesigned exhaust, and between July 1935 and July 1936 the remainder of the class was similarly upgraded.|$|E
25|$|Variable-geometry or variable-nozzle turbochargers use {{moveable}} vanes {{to adjust}} the air-flow to the turbine, imitating a turbocharger of the optimal size throughout the power curve. The vanes are placed {{just in front of}} the turbine like a set of slightly overlapping walls. Their angle is adjusted by an actuator to block or increase air flow to the turbine. This variability maintains a comparable exhaust velocity and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> throughout the engine’s rev range. The result is that the turbocharger improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of turbocharger lag.|$|E

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the maximum and average energies of protons, which were produced in the interaction of an intense laser pulse (similar to 1 x 10 (16) W cm(- 2), 65 fs) with hydrogen clusters in a gas jet backed up to 80 bar at liquid nitrogen temperature (similar to 80 K), on the <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> has been studied. The general trend of the proton energy dependence on {{the square of the}} average cluster radius, which is determined by a calibrated Rayleigh scattering measurement, is similar to that described by theory under the single size approximation. Calculations are made to fit the experimental results under a simplified model by taking into account both a log-normal cluster size distribution and the laser intensity attenuation in the interaction volume. A very good agreement between the experimental proton energy spectra and the calculations is obtained in the high- energy part of the proton energy distributions, but a discrepancy of the fits is revealed in the low-energy part at higher <b>backing</b> <b>pressures</b> which are associated with denser flows. A possible mechanism which would be responsible for this discrepancy is discussed. Finally, from the fits, a variation of the cluster size distributions was revealed to be dependent on the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> {{as well as on the}} evolving time of the gas flow of clusters...|$|R
25|$|Pouring metal defects include misruns, cold shuts, and inclusions. A misrun {{occurs when}} the liquid metal does not {{completely}} fill the mold cavity, leaving an unfilled portion. Cold shuts occur when two fronts of liquid metal do not fuse properly in the mold cavity, leaving a weak spot. Both are caused by either a lack of fluidity in the molten metal or cross-sections that are too narrow. The fluidity can be increased by changing the chemical composition of the metal or by increasing the pouring temperature. Another possible cause is <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> from improperly vented mold cavities.|$|E

No manual transmissions were available. Power for all engines, except the 460, was significantly reduced compared to 1974, and with the weight increase, fuel economy and performance continued to decrease.

25|$|Cooling towers {{originated}} in the 19th century {{through the development of}} condensers for use with the steam engine. Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, {{while at the same time}} increasing power and recycling boiler-water. However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical. The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040–2069. While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a return hose through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> This obstacle is overcome by using an exhaust valve working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the exhaust valve by using the leverage of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in breathing system (BIBS).|$|E
40|$|Using {{time-of-flight}} spectrometry, {{the interaction}} of intense femtosecond laser pulses with argon clusters has been studied by measuring the energy and yield of emitted ions. With two different supersonic nozzles, the dependence of average ion energy (E) over bar on cluster size (n) over bar in a large range of (n) over bar approximate to 3 x 10 (3) similar to 3 x 10 (6) has been measured. The experimental results indicate that when the cluster size (n) over bar <= 3 x 10 (5), the average ion energy (E) over bar proportional to (n) over bar (0. 5), Coulomb explosion is the dominant expansion mechanism. Beyond this size, the average ion energy gets saturated gradually, the clusters exhibit a mixed Coulomb-hydrodynamic expansion behavior. We also find that with the increasing gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure,</b> there is a maximum ion yield, the ion yield decreases as the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> is further increased...|$|R

For observing the combustion characteristics of porous media burners under various <b>back</b> <b>pressures,</b> investigating flame stability and figuring out the distribution laws of combustion gas flow and resistance loss, so as to achieve an optimized design and efficient operation of the devices, a bench of foamed ceramics porous media combustion devices was thus set up to test the cold-state resistance and hot-state combustion characteristic of burners in working conditions without <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> and with two different <b>back</b> <b>pressures.</b> The following results are achieved from this experimental study. (1) The strong thermal reflux of porous media can preheat the premixed air effectively, so the flame can be kept stable easily, the combustion equivalent ratio of porous media burners is {{lower than that of}} traditional burners, and its pollutant content of flue gas is much lower than the national standard value. (2) The friction coefficient of foamed ceramics decreases with the increase of air flow rate, and its decreasing rate slows down gradually. (3) When the flow rate of air is low, viscosity is the dominant flow resistance, and the friction coefficient is in an inverse relation with the flow rate. (4) As the flow rate of air increases, inertia is the dominant flow resistance, and the friction coefficient is mainly influenced by the roughness and cracks of foamed ceramics. (5) After the introduction of secondary air, the minimum equivalent ratio of porous media burners gets much lower and its range of equivalent ratio is much larger than that of traditional burners...|$|R
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable flight conditions are often guarded against, such as a wing drop, which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> The control forces across all regimes are well-balanced, which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are push-rod actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables.

25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} all this and the {{introduction}} of more recent Pacifics, {{in the middle of the}} 1950s Gresley types continued to have a quasi-monopoly of East Coast Main Line express passenger services, and as the Sixties approached they went through yet another series of improvements comparable to those of the 1920s. The most significant of these was the fitting of the French double Kylchap exhaust system, which was entirely due to the persistence from 1956 of P. N. Townend, Assistant District Motive Power Superintendent at King's Cross locomotive shed. [...] These modifications greatly reduced exhaust <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> making the locomotives more economical and free-running, and also kept the firetubes clean, reducing turn-around time, so much so that they were able to fit into the more intensive diesel locomotive workings. The Kylchap arrangement was already being universally applied to the A4 streamlined Pacifics, though with the non-streamlined A3 locomotives, the soft exhaust would cause the smoke and steam to drift into the driver's forward vision. The solution came in the form of narrow German-style smoke deflectors, which somewhat changed the appearance of the A3 locomotives in their latter days.|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} months, the two railway companies ran comparative exchange trials {{between the two}} types from which the Great Western emerged triumphant with 4079 Pendennis Castle. The LNER learned valuable lessons from the trials {{which resulted in a}} series of modifications carried out from 1926 on number 4477 Gay Crusader. Changes to the valve gear included increased lap and longer travel, in accordance with Great Western practice; this allowed fuller exploitation of the expansive properties of steam and reduced <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> from the exhaust, transforming performance and economy; the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180 psi Pacifics could undertake long-distance non-stop runs that had previously been impossible. There followed a complete redesign of the valve gear, which was applied to 2555 Centenary in 1927, {{with the rest of the}} class being modified in due course. Locomotives with modified valve gear had a slightly raised running plate over the cylinders in order to give room for the longer combination lever necessary for the longer valve travel. Another modification was made in 1927 when number 4480 Enterprise was fitted with a [...] boiler. This was closely followed by two other locomotives which also incorporated variations in the cylinder diameter and superheater size for comparative purposes. This led Gresley to make a radical departure from Churchward practice by increasing the number of large tubes containing superheating elements, hence increasing the superheater surface area in contact with the hot gases, thus raising steam temperature. The presence of the larger superheater could be recognised from the square covers on either side of the smokebox, a feature that the locomotives retained throughout the rest of their existence.|$|E
