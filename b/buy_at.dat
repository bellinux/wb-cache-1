25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1911 {{summer season}} the B ordered a {{replacement}} ship for £24,000 and put Slieve Bearnagh up for sale for £12,000. No-one offered to <b>buy</b> <b>at</b> that price so the railway reduced it to £10,000 by the end of 1911 and later to £7,000. The replacement ship, the slightly larger PS Erin's Isle, was launched on 12 June 1912, and finally on 19 June 1912 Slieve Bearnagh was sold for only £4,350.|$|E

25|$|Within the Party, {{there was}} major debate about redistribution. A {{moderate}} faction {{within the party}} and Politburo member Liu Shaoqi argued that change should be gradual and any collectivization of the peasantry should wait until industrialization, which could provide the agricultural machinery for mechanized farming. A more radical faction led by Mao Zedong argued {{that the best way}} to finance industrialization was for the government to take control of agriculture, thereby establishing a monopoly over grain distribution and supply. This would allow the state to <b>buy</b> <b>at</b> a low price and sell much higher, thus raising the capital necessary for the industrialization of the country.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s {{private housing}} was {{developed}} in Docklands which with some minor exceptions {{were the first to}} be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of buying a house close to the city at what appeared to be cheap prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to <b>buy</b> <b>at</b> discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses. Then again in the late 1990s, London had a huge house-price boom. By encouraging the development of attractive waterside apartments along the River Thames and the old docks, the LDDC brought new, middle-class residents into the area, closely followed by shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E

25|$|In practice, the {{segmentation}} approach {{relies on}} adequate fences between consumers {{so that everyone}} doesn't <b>buy</b> <b>at</b> the lowest price offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The fashion industry uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A backstage pass at a concert {{is a good example}} of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of price elasticity. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O (Origin & Destination) systems.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Martin Lee got {{together}} with songwriters Paul Curtis and David Kane to compose a musical based on The Butterfly Children books by Angela and Pat Mills. The musical had its world premiere at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow, to open the 1990 Glasgow City of Culture and ran {{for a month and}} was performed by the Mitchell Theatre for Youth. Just three months later, the show transferred to the larger Kings Theatre in Glasgow and ran for two weeks. The show transferred in late 1992 to London's West End. Brotherhood of Man recorded the songs themselves and the nineteen track collection, available on cassette only, was available to <b>buy</b> <b>at</b> the theatre. The album was never commercially released, although some tracks did make it onto tie-in cassettes to go with the books a few years later. The Butterfly Children, essentially a children's show, featured many differing styles of music from rap to rock and country and western to the more familiar pop the group were known for. The show's run ended after a short season, and has not been performed since.|$|E
25|$|Mail {{was vital}} for the prisoners of war. Letters allowed {{them not only}} to receive news from home but also to ask their {{families}} to send parcels and inform them of their receipt. Every month, a prisoner {{had the right to}} write two letters (limited to six pages each for officers, and four pages for other ranks), on paper that he had to <b>buy</b> <b>at</b> the camp, and four postcards. These were the numbers in theory, at least, though very often the practice differed. For the German authorities, mail represented a considerable source of pressure; the right to write and receive mail was regularly denied. In the first half of 1915, French prisoners sent 350,000 letters to France; the figure doubled {{in the second half of}} the year. On an average week, French prisoners received 45,000 letters containing money. This number fluctuated significantly: 8,356 such letters between 8 and 24 October 1914, 79,561 between 22 and 28 November 1915. Many prisoners did not know how to write and asked others to write for them. Censorship and package inspections were daily occurrences.|$|E

500|$|The vrijmarkt (literally 'free market') is a {{nationwide}} flea market, at {{which many people}} sell their used goods.

500|$|The square {{fell into}} disuse after the {{district}} court disbanded, and, in 1817, the city's trustees sold half of the city square {{to raise money for}} the establishment of an educational institution known as Danville Academy.

On February 13, 1818, the trustees voted to sell the other half of the square and allocate the money to the same purpose.
