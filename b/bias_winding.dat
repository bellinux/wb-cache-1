HTS coils were made using Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x HTS wire prepared by the powder-in-tube technique. The HTS wire was characterised as a conductor. The anisotropic HTS wire has a strongly magnetic-field-dependent critical current, which causes critical cunent degradation when used {{in the form of}} a coil. The magnetic field behaviour of the HTS coil was studied with respect to its critical cunent and magnetic field properties. HTS solenoid and pancake coils were produced using 2 ̆ 2 react and wind 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 wind and react 2 ̆ 2 procedures. Experiments which were carried out included magnetic field measurements of the HTS coils in DC and AC magnetic fields, and critical current ampere-turns when used as a magnetic core <b>bias</b> <b>winding.</b> The magnetic field distribution of the HTS coils was also investigated using a magnetic field analysis computer program. The magnetic field in the radial direction (By) (//c-axis) at the HTS coil side 2 ̆ 7 s edge has the most influence on the HTS coil performance at 77 K. The experimental results and analysis provide basic information for the design and operation of a HTS coil made from the anisotropic Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x wire. The designed electrical fault crrent limiter was based on the principle of a saturable magnetic core reactor, where a DC <b>bias</b> <b>winding</b> with a large number of ampere-turns is required to generate a high magnetic motive force (mmf) on a magnetic core. The HTS coil was also studied for use in this device as the DC <b>bias</b> <b>winding.</b> A small laboratory device rated at 3. 5 kW was made and tested to investigate the electrical behaviour of the saturable magnetic core fault cunent limiter and the HTS coil in this application. The electrical behaviour of this fault cunent limiter was also analysed using the modified device ψ-I characteristics, and also considered for application in a 6 kV power distribution system. The results show that this fault cunent limiter restricts fault cunents effectively both in the transient and steady states. A high voltage generator device was made and analysed with regard to using a HTS wire inductor. A laboratory high voltage generator device was built, based on a R-C-L resonant circuit, where large inductance and low resistance were required to generate high voltages from a low voltage battery source. Analysis showed that by using an HTS inductor to reduce the circuit resistance, the build-up voltage could be significantly increased. 1. 2 kV was generated using a small hybrid inductor from a 12 V battery source, and the potential build-up voltage when using a larger HTS inductor was shown to be very high. Both the electrical fault cunent limiter device and the electronic high voltage generator were analysed from measurements and simulations. With improvements in critical cunents and long lengths of Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x wires, HTS coils with high values of critical ampere-turns could be achieved at 77 K operating temperature. These will enable the above HTS applications to be practicable in electrical engineering...|$|E

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE The {{design of}} a {{switching}} power supply is an iterative process which involves many variables {{that have to be}} adjusted in order to obtain an optimized solution. However, there are trade-offs which allow for a simple low cost, low component, single sided board design method. This application note provides a simple approach to designing a converter utilizing the ON Semiconductor NCP 1055 high voltage switch regulator. The easy-to-follow step-by-step procedure guides the user into designing the different blocks that constitute the power supply, mainly the input block, the power stage, the magnetics, the snubber, the output block, and the feedback loop. The circuit diagram, bill of material, and PCB layout are also included {{at the end of the}} application note. This power supply is specifically designed for a 5. 0 V, 2. 0 A output and a maximum duty cycle of 48 %. It meets IEC and UL requirements. EMI is minimal and a 70 % achievable efficiency or greater is possible. The NCP 1055 is a family of monolithic high voltage switching regulators designed to work in rectified AC line sources and flyback converter applications. They are capable of providing an output power ranging from 6. 0 W to 40 W with a fixed AC input of 100 V, 115 V, or 230 V and 3. 0 W to 20 W with a variable AC input ranging from 85 V to 265 V. This device features an on-chip 700 V SENSEFET ™ power switch circuit, an active startup regulator circuit which eliminates the need for an auxiliary <b>bias</b> <b>winding</b> on the converter transformer, fault logic with a programmable timer for converter overload protection. Protective features provide power switch current limiting, input under voltage lockout with hysteresis, thermal shutdown, and restart fault detection.

40|$|With recent {{advances}} in semiconductor manufacturing and computational technology, digital control systems have grown to a relatively mature stage, and will soon become a viable replacement for their analogue counterparts {{in the design of}} isolated and non-isolated DC-to-DC converters in general, and yback converters in particular. Inspired by this possibility, the thesis adopts the first-ever digital control design in the field for wide-operating range yback converters, based on a low-cost microcontroller. Accurate transformer modelling is a necessary exercise {{for the study of the}} yback converters as well as for model-based controller design. Therefore, a non-linear dynamic model, which allows an accurate representation of both linear dynamics and non-linear core behaviour in a practical transformer, is proposed. The parameters of the proposed transformer model are obtained using time-domain system identification based on experimental data. In order to reduce the round-of error typically occurring in the collected time-domain data, a method which is based on adjusting the value of the current sensing resistor is also adopted. To facilitate control design, a control-oriented model is developed based on the full converter model through a simplification step. As demonstrated in the thesis, the control-oriented model is able to preserve the bulk of the full converter model fidelity, critical for a control design step, while at the same time requiring a significantly shorter execution time for simulation when compared with the full converter model. For the purpose of implementing isolated-feedback control within a low-cost microcontroller, a magnetic sensing principle, which can operates in both continuous and discontinuous conduction modes of the yback converter, is developed. The proposed sensing principle is also based on the <b>bias</b> <b>winding</b> voltage of the yback transformer to estimate the converter output voltage; however, the sampling instant is chosen at the point where the secondary current is known, instead of the knee point where the secondary current is zero. The implementation of the proposed sensing technique, based on analogue circuitry and a microcontroller, is also studied. Finally, optimum digital control for a wide-operating range yback converter is developed and implemented. The control architecture is purposely designed to perform a variety of tasks, including efficiency optimisation, magnetic sensing, and valley switching operation, in addition to the main task of regulating the output voltage. Three different methods for synthesizing optimum compensators, based on mixed-sensitivity H 1 robust control theory, gain-adaptive predictive functional control (GAPFC) theory, and gain-adaptive quantitative feedback theory (GAQFT), are also studied. In order to improve the performance of the robust controllers, parametric variations of the yback converter models are minimized before applying the robust control. Two possibilities for reducing converter parametric model uncertainty, based on adapting the converter open-loop gain and varying the sampling rate of the digital controller, are also demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of systematic biases in climate models used in operational seasonal forecasting adversely affects {{the quality of}} forecasts they produce. In this study, we examine the initial evolution of systematic biases in the ECMWF System 4 forecast model, and isolate aspects of the model simulations {{that lead to the}} {{development of}} these biases. We focus on the tendency of the simulated intertropical convergence zone in the western equatorial Pacific to drift northwards by between 0. 5 ° and 3 ° of latitude depending on season. Comparing observations with both fully coupled atmosphere–ocean hindcasts and atmosphere-only hindcasts (driven by observed sea-surface temperatures), we show that the northward drift is caused by a cooling of the sea-surface temperature on the Equator. The cooling is associated with anomalous easterly wind stress and excessive evaporation during the first twenty days of hindcast, both of which occur whether air-sea interactions are permitted or not.

Given that wind and temperature are related through thermal wind balance, structural errors in the processes that determine the tropical temperature profile, such as shallow convection, can therefore lead to biases in TC position. This paper evaluates the influence of shallow convection on Advanced Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model (AHW) TC track forecasts by cycling an ensemble data assimilation during a 1 -month period in 2008 where cumulus convection is parameterized on the coarse-resolution domain using the Kain–Fritsch scheme or the modified Tiedtke scheme, which contains a more appropriate treatment of oceanic shallow convection. Short-term forecasts with the Kain–Fritsch scheme are characterized by a 1 -K, 700 -hPa temperature bias overmuch of thewesternAtlanticOcean, which is attributed {{to a lack of}} shallow convection within that scheme.

Surface <b>wind</b> <b>biases</b> in the GEOS- 5 AGCM are decreased by up to 1. 2 m/s. The new parameterization also has implications aloft as improvements extend into the stratosphere. Many other GCMs (both for operational weather forecasting and climate) use a similar class of parameterization for their air-sea roughness scheme. We therefore expect that results from GEOS- 5 are relevant to other models as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) {{dispersion}} model {{is widely used}} by the U. S. Department of Defense {{and the results of}} previous evaluations have been presented at Harmonization conferences. The version of its diagnostic wind model that is applied to urban areas has been significantly updated to remove <b>biases</b> in <b>wind</b> speed estimates, requiring re-evaluations with urban tracer data sets such as the Joint Urban 2003 (JU 2003) data base. For comparison purposes, a simple Gaussian-format urban {{dispersion model}} has been run for the same JU 2003 data base. The simple urban model has previously been evaluated with the Madison Square Garden 2005 (MSG 05) data. The evaluations focus on 30 -minute averaged (1) arc maximum concentrations and (2) concentrations paired in space. It is shown that the revisions to the diagnostic wind model in urban HPAC have resulted in improved performance. Similar good performance is found for the simple urban dispersion model, although it has more errors for off-centerline and upwind receptors in the downtown area.

40|$|Horizontal winds at 850 hPa from {{tropical}} cyclones retrieved {{using the}} nonlinear balance equation, where the mass field was determined from Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) temperature soundings, are {{compared with the}} surface wind fields derived from NASA’s Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) and Hurricane Research Division H*Wind analyses. It {{was found that the}} AMSU-derived wind speeds at 850 hPa have linear relations with the surface wind speeds from QuikSCAT or H*Wind. There are also characteristic <b>biases</b> of <b>wind</b> direction between AMSU and QuikSCAT or H*Wind. Using this information to adjust the speed and correct for the directional bias, a new algorithm was developed for estimation of the tropical cyclone surface wind field from the AMSU-derived 850 -hPa winds. The algorithm was evaluated in two independent cases from Hurricanes Floyd (1999) and Michelle (2001), which were observed simulta-neously by AMSU, QuikSCAT, and H*Wind. In this evaluation the AMSU adjustment algorithm for wind speed worked well. Results also showed that the bias correction algorithm for wind direction has room for improvement. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. This paper compares wind speed and {{direction}} output from the WRF mesoscale model with measurements taken on two offshore meteorological masts in the Irish Sea. The WRF model is run using both the reanalysis dataset ERA-Interim {{supplied by the}} European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the combined datasets MERRA- 2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) and GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) both supplied by the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Centre. It is found that using WRF with the ERA-Interim data returns reliable offshore wind resource statistics, both on an individual 10 -minute timeframe and averaged across the 40 day validation period. The MERRA- 2 /GLDAS data however led WRF to significantly underestimate wind speeds and positively <b>bias</b> the <b>wind</b> direction from sectors with longer fetch. There was also evidence of the directional bias being smaller when using the ERA-Interim data for directions with smaller fetch. A good background knowledge is recommended when using WRF...|$|R
50|$|Two sets {{of models}} were {{run for the}} IPCC, {{consisting}} of very similar ocean circulations but different methodology for solving the equations of motion. The {{result is that the}} models have very different wind stresses over the Southern Ocean, with the CM2.0 exhibiting the common <b>bias</b> of <b>winds</b> that are shifted equatorward but the CM2.1 model being one of the few that have winds close to the correct latitude and magnitude in this region (Russell et al., 2006). Work by Reichler and Kim at the University of Utah suggests that this model series {{is one of the top}} models in a range of atmospheric characteristics. It also has one of the better simulations of El Nino among the IPCC models (van Oldenburgh et al., 2005; Wittenberg et al., 2006). However, as is the case with most AOGCMs run without flux adjustment, the models fail to capture the cold upwelling zones along the eastern boundaries of the Pacific and Atlantic, and tend to produce an overly dry Amazon basin.|$|R

These wind {{speed measurements}} are used both in numerical weather prediction and in climate studies {{and need to be}} known as accurately as possible. This paper presents results from threedimensional CFD studies of the mean airflow over various research ships and a generic tanker/bulk. It will be shown that the <b>bias</b> in the <b>wind</b> speed measurements is highly dependent upon anemometer position and ship shape. CFD results are compared to in situ wind speed measurementsmade from a number of anemometers above the bridge of the RRS Charles Darwin...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for processing}} flight-test data to provide state estimates and instrument calibrations for aerodynamic or hydrodynamic system identification by the equation error estimation method is developed and demonstrated on synthesized data. The extended-Kalman-filter algorithm employs a locally level, north-pointing frame of reference, accounts for rotating ellipsoidal earth effects, and estimates sensor <b>bias,</b> scale factors, <b>wind</b> components, and process noise levels by maximum-likelihood parameters. The method {{is found to}} be most effective with navigation quality inertial input data. The algorithm is applied to data from a six-degree-of-freedom F- 4 aircraft simulation and shown to produce state estimates in good agreement with the simulation values...|$|R
40|$|Winds modeled {{from data}} {{measured}} with the University of New Hampshire Meteor Wind Radar System at Durham, New Hampshire, {{over the two}} 4 -day periods November 20 to 23, 1981 and May 8 to 11, 1982 are presented. The raw meteor wind data was fit in a least square sense to a three dimensional model containing mean, 12 -, 24 -, and 48 -h periods. The means winds for both periods {{are very close to}} the three year average values at Durham during May and November, respectively. The semidiurnal component for the November period had a normal amplitude and phase, and an estimated veritcal wavelength of 60 km. The May period results were essentially typical except that the Northward amplitude was 3 to 4 times smaller than normal. The diurnal amplitudes measured for both periods are typical for Durham and the diurnal phase is normally not very consistent. The 48 -hour component amplitude is typical for these months. The intrinsic errors fo the radar are approximately + or - 2 km in position and + or - 4 m/s in radial velocity including quantization errors. These errors are random with zero mean and should not <b>bias</b> the <b>wind</b> results...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to measure mean velocities above a solid block located in a wind tunnel. A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was used. The purpose of the investigation was to quantify the change in the mean flow speed caused by the bluff body and hence to determine the possible <b>bias</b> in <b>wind</b> speed measurement made from anemometers located above the superstructure of merchant ships. Possible sources of experimental error were investigated and resulted in; a) a blockage ratio correction which varied with position, b) the use of 2 -dimensional maps of the free stream flow to obtain reference velocities and c) an estimate of a residual bias of up to 4 % in the PIV wind speed data. The wind speed was accelerated by up to 28 % compared to the free stream (or undistorted) wind speed. Close {{to the top of the}} block the wind speed is severely decelerated and the airflow reverses in direction. There was no dependence of either the pattern of the flow or of the magnitude of the <b>wind</b> speed <b>bias</b> on changes in wind directions of up to 30 degrees...|$|R
