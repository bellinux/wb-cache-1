50|$|Metal Battler: Appear in episode 9. Powers include flight, {{underside}} energy beams in saucer mode, claw {{hands that}} can fire energy <b>bolts,</b> <b>shoulder</b> energy cannons, and an 8-tube torso machine gun.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>bolt</b> or Stripper bolt - Bolt {{with a broad}} smooth {{shoulder}} and small threaded end {{used to create a}} pivot or attachment point.|$|R
50|$|Machinery {{eye bolts}} are fully {{threaded}} {{and may have}} a collar, making them suitable for use with angular loads up to 45°. Eye <b>bolts</b> without a <b>shoulder</b> {{should not be used}} for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|Another use of reamed holes is {{to receive}} a {{specialized}} bolt that has an unthreaded shoulder - also called a <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolt.</b> This type of bolt is commonly used to replace hot peened rivets during the seismic retrofit of structures.|$|R
5000|$|In the semi-final round, #1 of the year. LaShawn Merritt cruised to an easy {{win in the}} first, with Christophe Lemaitre second. The second semi saw Usain Bolt run 19.78, in {{the last}} few metres Andre De Grasse rushed up to <b>Bolt's</b> <b>shoulder,</b> the two friends looking at each other and {{laughing}} as they crossed the line. Bolt's time was his fastest the year and De Grasse set a new Canadian record of 19.80 seconds. As Bud Winter the sprint coach who influenced Glen Mills, Bolt's coach, would say; [...] "Relax and win." [...] Both the time qualifiers Adam Gemili and Ramil Guliyev both came from this fastest of the three semi final heats. #3 of the year, Ameer Webb was left behind. In the third semi, Alonso Edward and Churandy Martina qualified in 1st and 2nd place. World #2 in 2016 Justin Gatlin held the lead with 50 metres to go but started looking around did not keep up his speed sufficiently. He should have seen Alonso Edward as he pulled ahead of Gatlin and on the far outside, Churandy Martina closed fast to take the second qualifying position. Gatlin failed to reach the final. 2012 silver medallist and number #2 runner of all time, Yohan Blake finished sixth.|$|R
5000|$|From 1960 to 1973, {{the colors}} {{consisted}} of various shades of Electric blue ("powder" [...] blue, but technically called Collegiate blue) or white jerseys, both with gold lightning <b>bolts</b> on the <b>shoulders.</b> The helmets {{were white and}} had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold or navy depending on the year, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966. In 1973, the numerals on the blue jerseys changed from white to gold.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} includes self-portrait of Paolozzi as {{the naked}} Newton, measuring the universe with his dividers. The eyes were copied from Michelangelo's David. It {{can be interpreted}} as symbolising a confluence of the two cultures, the arts and the sciences, and illustrating how Newton changed our view of the world to one determined by mathematical laws. The sculpture makes the body resemble a mechanical object, joined with <b>bolts</b> at the <b>shoulders,</b> elbows, knees and ankles. The sculptures shows the visible seams of Paolozzi's technique of dividing his model and reassembling the pieces, for example on the head.|$|R
5000|$|Scarlet {{returns and}} haunts {{the streets of}} Brooklyn armed with her crossbow. She finds Bertrand Crawley and, {{recognizing}} him {{as a friend of}} Marc Spector (or Jake Lockley), fires a crossbow <b>bolt</b> into his <b>shoulder.</b> Crawley runs off and falls through the glass front door of Gena's Diner. Scarlet follows after him, firing several more shots into the diner. She pitches Gena Landers through a window then fires a shot into the oven's gas lines, causing the entire building to explode. Scarlet returns to the church where she lives, confident that her [...] "sweet angel" [...] will come for her.|$|R
50|$|Back then a CIDCO {{transaxle}} {{could be}} purchased, this stands for Corvair Improvement Distributing Company as owned by Bob Anderson. At {{one time he}} developed Corvair transaxles with many improvements, not only for Corvairs but the kit car industry as well. Bob improved the longevity of the differentials thru many modifications, re-manufacture and re-engineering, along with careful assembly. This included having reverse cut ring and pinion gears made for the Kelmark transaxle setup which ran in reverse. His setup was in great demand by the mid-engine Corvair enthusiasts. One of the trademarks of the CIDCO diff is the <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolted</b> steel plate cover {{on top of the}} differential in place of the tin cover.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} Jeep application, the {{ignition}} control module (ICM) {{is located in}} engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, {{as well as an}} integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor. The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special <b>shouldered</b> <b>bolts</b> to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Variable Threat Response Battle Suit Mark I was {{a version}} of the Iron Man armor utilizing laser guided munitions. Stark gave Rhodes {{a modified version of the}} armor, Mark II Model JRXL-1000, created just for him with the inclusion of repulsors and a unibeam projector. The armor could be modified with various modular weapons and has an improved tactical computer system with automatic targeting. Additional weapons included pulse <b>bolt</b> generators, retractable <b>shoulder</b> minigun, variable-configured double-barrel cannons on each gauntlet, gauntlet mounted flamethrower, plasma blade on the left gauntlet, missile box launcher, micro-rocket launcher, particle beam discharger, and an electromagnetic pulse generator in the unibeam projector that could shut down any electronic device in a 50-mile radius. The armor also included a photon emitter that created a force shield, forcefield-based stealth technology, boot-jet propulsion, and a self-contained breathing system.|$|R
5000|$|Fred {{returns to}} the hotel {{to find that the}} hotel is full of people who {{followed}} Jasmine back to the hotel after she took a walk. Fred talks covertly to Wesley about her visit to the hospital and what she saw. Wesley says he believes her, then goes over to talk to Gunn and then Jasmine upstairs. The news spreads amongst the gang and Fred panics, heading for the weapons cabinet. She grabs a crossbow and lets a bolt fly at Jasmine. Angel takes the <b>bolt</b> in the <b>shoulder</b> and drops to the floor below with Connor chasing after. Lorne tries to confront Fred about her actions, but she pulls a knife on him and uses him to keep the others at bay. Jasmine tells Fred that her love will always be there and Fred lets Lorne go, then runs away alone.|$|R
30|$|Dynamisation of an {{external}} fixator {{is important in}} regenerate training and consolidation of an osteotomy or fracture. One reported downside {{of the most frequently}} used hexapod, the Taylor spatial frame (TSF), is the lack of ease of achieving this. Controlled frame dynamisation with the TSF is not achievable easily due to the limited two-ring construct and interosseous transfixion [24]. Unlocking individual, alternate or all struts lead to an uncontrolled loss of stability in one or more planes [24]. This can be ameliorated by the use of non-standard modified <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolts,</b> which permit some motion between strut and ring, whilst preserving the overall configuration and relative stability, but this has not been proven. The OSF appears to exceed the mechanical characteristics of the Ilizarov fixator in terms of rigidity and allows controlled and safe dynamisation for desirable regenerate training without the risk of excessive and unwanted deformation. This may prove of clinical importance and will need to be confirmed in clinical studies.|$|R
40|$|The ITER {{diagnostics}} generic upper {{port plug}} (GUPP) is {{developed as a}} standardized design for all diagnostic upper port plugs, in which a variety of payloads can be mounted. Here, the remote handling compatibility analysis (RHCA) of the GUPP design is presented that was performed for the GUPP final design review. The analysis focuses mainly on the insertion and extraction procedure of the diagnostic shield module (DSM), a removable cassette that contains the diagnostic in-vessel components. It is foreseen that the DSM is a replaceable component – the procedure {{of which is to}} be performed inside the ITER hot cell facility (HCF), where the GUPP can be oriented in a vertical position. The DSM removal procedure in the HCF consists of removing locking pins, an M 30 sized <b>shoulder</b> <b>bolt</b> and two electrical straps {{through the use of a}} dexterous manipulator, after which the DSM is lifted out of the GUPP by an overhead crane. For optimum access to its internals, the DSM is mounted in a handling device. The insertion of a new or refurbished DSM follows the reverse procedure. The RHCA shows that the GUPP design requires a moderate amount of changes to become fully compatible with RH maintenance requirements...|$|R
5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special <b>shouldered</b> <b>bolts</b> to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|R
