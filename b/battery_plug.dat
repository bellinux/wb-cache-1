40|$|Tal, Nicholas, Davies and Woodjack The growing plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEVs) market features new models of battery {{electric vehicle}}s (BEVs) and Plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) with varying battery sizes and electric driving range. How are these different models {{being used in}} the real world? A common assumption in PEV impact analysis is that PEV owners will maximize their vehicle utility by appropriately sizing their battery to their driving needs and by charging their vehicles as much as possible to recover the cost of the vehicle purchase. Based on these assumptions we expect PHEV owners who drive more to plug-in more and drivers of PHEVs with small <b>battery</b> to <b>plug</b> in more than owners of vehicles with a larger battery and similar driving patterns. This paper examines the assumptions presented using a survey of more than 3, 500 PEV owners conducted in California in May and June 2013. The online survey includes extensive data on driving and charging behavior using web-map questions and includes owners of all PEV models in the market including more than 600 Volts and 800 Plug-in Priuses. The results show that small battery PHEV electric vehicle miles traveled (eVMT) are lower than larger range PHEV or BEVs {{not only because of the}} battery size but also as a result of the public charging availability and charging behavior. Higher electric range PHEV drivers and BEV drivers charge more often and report more charging opportunities in the same areas that smaller battery PHEVs could not find chargers...|$|R

Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the <b>battery</b> even when <b>plugged</b> in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state.

5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{wireless}} systems are commonly used: FM, audio induction loop, and InfraRed. Each system has advantages and benefits for particular uses. FM {{systems can be}} <b>battery</b> operated or <b>plugged</b> into an electrical outlet. FM system produce an analog audio signal, meaning they have extremely high fidelity. Many FM systems are very small in size, allowing them {{to be used in}} mobile situations. The audio induction loop permits the listener with hearing loss to be free of wearing a receiver provided that the listener has a hearing aid or cochlear implant processor with an accessory called a [...] "telecoil". If the listener does not have a telecoil, then he or she must carry a receiver with an earpiece. As with FM systems, the infrared (IR) system also requires a receiver to be worn or carried by the listener. An advantage of IR wireless systems is that people in adjoining rooms cannot listen in on conversations, making it useful for situations where privacy and confidentiality are required. Another way to achieve confidentiality is to use a hardwired amplifier, which contains or is connected to a microphone and transmits no signal beyond the earpiece plugged directly into it.|$|R

Utility transmission lines are under-utilized {{during the night}}. Charging Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles during the night and redistributing the power stored in the batteries utilizes the transmission lines more efficiently and is the motivation for this thesis. In an example scenario, a vehicle is fully charged at home during the night, and is driven {{to work in the}} morning. The vehicle is plugged in at work and continues to charge. Under peak power demand the grid can command some power from these vehicles, relieving stress on the utility. This thesis develops an in-vehicle interface to achieve this functionality. A novel topology is developed for an all-in-one system for electric vehicles. The system is a bi-directional <b>battery</b> charger when <b>plugged</b> into single or three-phase, and doubles as the motor inverter when the vehicle is driven.

40|$|We {{are using}} energy in most {{buildings}} inefficiently. Buildings in the U. S. consume over 70 % {{of the electricity}} used nationally. Efforts to improve the efficiency of appliances, HVAC equipment, lights and office equipment are important and have been effective, but do not address equipment operation and do not address inevitable losses due to remaining inefficiencies. For example, even highly efficient fluorescent lamp ballasts currently on the market generate 2 - 6 watts of waste heat per ballast, depending on type and configuration. A 2003 LBNL study indicated that nearly 3 billion products that contain power supplies are in use in the United States, and these numbers will grow. These products account for tens or {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars of waste electrical power, both due to inefficiency, e. g., in the lamp ballast, and due to poor operating scheduling, e. g., <b>battery</b> chargers left <b>plugged</b> in but idling or not charging a battery. More generally, at any point in the life of a building, mechanical and electrical equipment – the services infrastructure – may be poorly operated. Equipment may be inadvertently left in operation when not needed: lights and fans running all night or air conditioning in unoccupied spaces. Or equipment may be operated in ignorance of the cost, a problem exacerbated by time-varying electrical rates. Further, as buildings age, both the equipment and the building façade or envelope – a part of the constructio...|$|R
40|$|At Risø DTU a Toyota Prius {{has been}} {{equipped}} with a battery that gives the car a range of approximately 50 km on electricity only and thereby been converted from a hybrid electrical vehicle, HEV, to a plug-in hybrid electrical vehicle, PHEV. Changes in supply and demand on the wholesale power market {{are reflected in the}} electricity price level and if PHEV users select to charge in periods of lower price it will affect their total cost of charging and by that the cost per driven kilometre. This report investigates the effect of a few different charging strategies on the charging cost to a user that faces variable electricity prices. The traditional way of recharging a <b>battery</b> is to <b>plug</b> it in and to switch on the charger immediately and then to dissconnect the charger when the battery is fully charged. This scenario will be used as a reference in terms of charging cost. For scheduled charging under a time period between plug-in and unplugging of the vehicle to the grid the electricity prices during different time steps of this period must be either known or forecast. Focus in this report is on the characteristics of the components involved in a system for automated vehicle charging and potential approaches to the charging strategy. The numerical findings suffer from a simple and non-adaptive forecast model and anomalous behaviour of an optimisation function. It can however be seen that the more elaborate optimisation models that could be calculated did produce a lower charging cost than their more simple counterparts. ii Acknowledgements Most of all want to thank my supervisor Niels Kjølstad Poulsen at the Depart-ment of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University o...|$|R
40|$|Tunable {{diode laser}} {{spectroscopy}} (TDLS) is an up and coming trace and major gas monitoring technology with unmatched selectivity, range and stability. The technology {{demonstration of the}} 4 gas Multi-Gas Monitor (MGM), reported at the 2014 ICES conference, operated continuously on the International Space Station (ISS) for nearly a year. The MGM is designed to measure oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapor in ambient cabin air in a low power, relatively compact device. While on board, the MGM experienced a number of challenges, unplanned and planned, including {{a test of the}} ammonia channel using a commercial medical ammonia inhalant. Data from the unit was downlinked once per week and compared with other analytical resources on board, notably the Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA), a magnetic sector mass spectrometer. MGM spent the majority of the time installed in the Nanoracks Frame 2 payload facility in front breathing mode (sampling the ambient environment of the Japanese Experiment Module), but was also used to analyze recirculated rack air. The capability of the MGM to be operated in portable mode (via internal rechargeable lithium ion polymer <b>batteries</b> or by <b>plugging</b> into any Express Rack 28 VDC connector) {{was a part of the}} usability demonstration.

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} is to {{construct}} and demonstrate EXPLORER, a modular, remotely controllable, self-powered, untethered robot system for the inspection of live gas distribution 150 mm (6 -inch) to 200 mm (8 -inch) diameter mains. The system, which was designed in an earlier effort, is built in a modular fashion {{in order to accommodate}} various components intended to accomplish different inspection, repair, sample retrieval, and other in-pipe tasks. The prototype system to be built under this project will include all the basic modules needed by the system, i. e. the locomotion, power storage, wireless communication, and camera. The camera, a solid-state fisheye-type, is used to transmit real-time video to the operator that allows for the live inspection of gas distribution pipes. This module, which incorporates technology developed by NASA, has been designed, constructed and tested in the earlier effort. In the current effort, the full prototype system will be tested in the laboratory followed by two field demonstrations in real applications in NYGAS member utilities' pipes. The purpose for EXPLORER {{is to be able to}} access live gas mains, insert the system in the piping network, and remotely ''drive'' it within the gas main and its laterals through distances of five to ten thousand feet. Its adaptable locomotion system allows the robot to function through varying diameter pipes (150 - 200 mm or 6 - to 8 -inches) and is powered via on-board battery-banks. The presence of fish-eye cameras in both ends of the robot allows the operator to view the forward and circumferential views of the internals live using an above-ground TV. Communication takes place via wireless link between the robot and the launch-chamber used to insert/retrieve the system. This link is based on commercial technology presently employed in wireless telecommunication networks. Communication over long distances as well as battery re-charging will be accomplished without retrieving the robot but through the use of auxiliaries, to be developed in a follow-on phase, that will allow insertion of additional antennas and <b>battery</b> recharge <b>plugs</b> into the pipe under live conditions through inexpensive keyhole sized excavations. The proposed system significantly advances the state of the art in inspection systems for gas distribution mains, which presently consist of tethered systems of limited range (about 500 ft form the point of launch) and limited inspection views. Also current inspection systems have no ability to incorporate additional modules to expand their functionality. This development program is a joint effort among the New York Gas Group (NYGAS; a trade association of the publicly owned gas utilities in New York State), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Johnson Space Center (JSC), Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) National Robotics Engineering Consortium (NREC), and the US Department of Energy (DOE) through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The DOE's contribution to this project is $ 499, 023 out of a total of $ 780, 735 (not including NASA's contribution).
