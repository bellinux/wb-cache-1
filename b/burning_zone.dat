In terms of characterization, the role of Dana Scully was seen as innovative, changing [...] "how women [...] were not just perceived but behaved" [...] and perhaps influencing the portrayal of other [...] "strong women" [...] investigators. Russell T Davies said The X-Files had been an inspiration on his series Torchwood, describing it as [...] "dark, wild and sexy... The X-Files meets This Life". Other shows have been influenced by the tone and mood of The X-Files. For example, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew from the mood and coloring of The X-Files, as well as from its occasional blend of horror and humor; creator Joss Whedon described his show as a cross between The X-Files and My So-Called Life. It also inspired themes in video games Deus Ex and Perfect Dark.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a semiempirical, zero-dimensional {{multizone}} model, {{developed by the}} authors, is implemented on two automotive diesel engines, a heavy-duty truck engine and a light-duty passenger car engine with pilot fuel injection, for various operating conditions including variation of power/speed, EGR rate, fuel injection timing, fuel injection pressure, and boost pressure, to verify its capability for Nitric Oxide (NO) emission prediction. The model utilizes cylinder’s basic geometry and engine operating data and measured cylinder pressure to estimate the apparent combustion rate which is then discretized into <b>burning</b> <b>zones</b> according to the calculation step used. The requisite unburnt charge for the combustion in the zones is calculated using the zone equivalence ratio provided from a new empirical formula involving parameters derived from the processing of the measured cylinder pressure and typical engine operating parameters. For the calculation of NO formation, the extended Zeldovich mechanism is used. From this approach, the model is able to provide the evolution of NO formation inside each burned zone and, cumulatively, the cylinder’s NO formation history. As proven from the investigation conducted herein, the proposed model adequately predicts NO emissions and NO trends when the engine settings vary, with low computational cost. These encourage its use for engine control optimization regarding NOx abatement and real-time/model-based NOx control applications...|$|R
40|$|Rotary cement kilns {{are widely}} used to convert calcineous raw meal into cement clinker, and are key {{components}} in the cement industry. In this article, we report a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based model to capture key transport processes in rotary cement kilns. Separate but coupled computational models were developed for the bed and the freeboard regions of the rotary kiln. The complex swirling airflow produced by kiln burners, coal combustion, gas-phase combustion of volatile matter and radiative heat transfer in the freeboard region were modeled. The clinkerization reactions in the bed region were modeled assuming solids as pseudo fluids. Coating formation in cement kilns (for both bed and freeboard regions) was considered. Appropriate source and sink terms were developed to model transfer of CO(2) from the bed to the freeboard region due to calcination reaction in the bed region. The developed bed and freeboard models were coupled by mass and energy communication through common interface. These coupled computational models were able to quite satisfactorily predict the available data from industrial kilns and previously published results.

40|$|Among {{different}} refractory materials, magnesium aluminate spinel is {{of great}} importance from the industrial point of view, mainly due to its excellent corrosion and thermal shock resistances. Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4), the only compound forms in the MgO-Al 2 O 3 system, has the most desirable characteristics for refractory application, along with the environmental friendliness. Other than refractory there are studies for its applications as humidity sensors, transparent ceramic, anode material in aluminum cell, etc. In combination with alumina, spinel {{is of great}} importance as the refractory lining material for the steel ladles essential for iron & steel industries due to excellent corrosion and thermal shock resistances. Again in association with magnesia {{it is important for}} the <b>burning</b> <b>zones</b> and transition zones of cement rotary kilns. The major reason for this application is its better resistance to thermal shock and alkali materials, which indicates two or three times longer service lives than other basic bricks such as conventional MgO-chrome. Magnesium aluminate spinel has always an environment friendly advantage, so it has received favor from researchers, scientists and industrialists all over world. Despite all these properties and application, the magnesium aluminate spinel is not commercially successful at per due to its high cost of production. The formation of magnesium aluminate spinel from its reactant is associated with a volume expansion which hinders to obtain dense magnesium aluminate spinel in a single step firing process. The commercial synthesis process involves two stage firing process which increases the cost of production The present work focused on synthesis of magnesium aluminate spinel from commercial grade oxide using a single step sintering process. The effect of planetary milling, effect of additives like zinc Oxide, zirconium dioxide was studied. The effect of insitu generated magnesia and alumina from nitrate precursor was also studied. The sintering study was done in the temperature range 1200 - 16000 C. The phase and microstructure was studied with varying milling time and additive percentage using X-ray diffraction technique and field emission scattered electron microscopy respectively. The flexural strength and thermal shock behavior was also studied for each batch. Dense magnesium aluminate spinel was successfully produced. The planetary milling and additive were found to enhance spinellisation process at lower temperature.

40|$|By direct {{hydrodynamic}} simulation, {{using the}} Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) code PROMETHEUS, we study {{the properties of}} a convective oxygen burning shell in a SN 1987 A progenitor star (20 M⊙) prior to collapse. The convection is too heterogeneous and dynamic to be well approximated by one-dimensional diffusion-like algorithms which have previously been used for this epoch. Qualitatively new phenomena are seen. The simulations are two-dimensional, with good resolution in radius and angle, and used a large (90 -degree) slice centered at the equator. The microphysics and the initial model were carefully treated. Many of the qualitative features of previous multi-dimensional simulations of convection are seen, including large kinetic and acoustic energy fluxes, which are not accounted for by mixing length theory. Small but significant amounts of 12 C are mixed non-uniformly into the oxygen <b>burning</b> convection <b>zone,</b> resulting in hot spots of nuclear energy production which are more than {{an order of magnitude}} more energetic than the oxygen flame itself. Density perturbations (up to 8 %) occur at the “edges ” of the convective zone and are the result of gravity waves generated by interaction of penetrating flows into the stable region. Perturbations of temperature and Ye (or neutron excess η) {{at the base of the}} convective zone are of sufficient magnitude to create angular inhomogeneities in explosive nucleosynthesis products, and need to be included in quantitative estimates of yields.

40|$|The cores of {{luminous}} B and A-type (BA) supergiant {{stars are}} {{the seeds of}} later core collapse supernovae. Thus, constraining the near-core conditions in this class of stars can place tighter constraints on the size, mass and chemical composition of supernova remnants. Asteroseismology of these massive stars is one possible approach into such investigations. Recently, Moravveji et al. (2012, hereafter Paper I) extracted 19 significant frequencies from a 6 -year radial velocity monitoring or Rigel (β Ori, B 8 Ia). The periods they determined broadly range from 1. 22 to 74. 74 days. Based on our differentially rotating stellar structure and evolution model, Rigel, at it's current evolutionary state, is undergoing core He burning and shell H burning. Linear fully non-adiabatic non-radial stability analyses result in the excitation of a dense spectrum of non-radial gravity-dominated mixed modes. The fundamental radial mode (ℓ= 0) and its overtones are all stable. When the hydrogen burning shell is located even partially in the radiative zone, a favorable condition for destabilization of g-modes through the so-called ϵ-mechanism becomes viable. Only those g-modes that have high relative amplitudes in the hydrogen <b>burning</b> (radiative) <b>zone</b> can survive the strong radiative damping. From the entire observed range of variability periods of Rigel (found in Paper I), and based on our model, only those modes with periods ranging between 21 to 127 days can be theoretically explained by the ϵ-mechanism. The origin of the short-period variations (found in Paper I) still remain unexplained. Because Rigel is similar to other massive BA supergiants, {{we believe that the}} ϵ-mechanism may be able to explain the long-period variations in α Cygni class of pulsating stars.

40|$|AbstractFlame structure, flow {{topology}} and {{the relative}} alignments of principal strain rates with scalar gradients and the vorticity vector in turbulent spray flames arising from mono-disperse droplets have been analysed using three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) data. An extensive parametric analysis has been performed {{for a range of}} values of droplet equivalence ratio (ϕd), droplet diameter (ad) and turbulence intensity (u′). The results have been analysed to analyse the statistical behaviours of the alignments of the gradients of mixture fraction and reaction progress variable and of the vorticity vector (ω→) with the local principal strain rates. The resulting alignments of reactive scalar gradient and vorticity with local principal strain rates in droplet-laden flames have been compared to those observed for a gaseous stoichiometric premixed flame under the same turbulent flow conditions. The differences in behaviour have been identified in terms of the statistical behaviours of scalar gradient and vorticity alignments with local principal strain rates in terms of the eight local flow topologies, classified as either focal (four topologies) or nodal (four topologies), in four zones across the flame: leading edge, preheat <b>zone,</b> <b>burning</b> reactants and trailing edge. This information has in turn been utilised to offer detailed physical explanations for the observed differences in alignment statistics of reactive scalar gradient and vorticity between turbulent premixed and spray flames.

Combustion investigations in this work have ranged from the understanding of fundamental combustion, with work performed on neighboring edge flame stabilization to more application oriented investigations. Applications involve the understanding of a stabilization technique currently used in gas turbine augmenters, bluff body stabilized flames, and one {{that may be the}} future of gas turbine combustors, the Ultra Compact Combustor (UCC), which utilizes cavity stabilized flames. ^ Through a combination of Rayleigh scattering imaging and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) neighboring edge flames were found to stabilize dominantly based on conditions upstream of each individual flame based on information regarding the concentration gradients upstream of each flame and qualitative heat release of each flame. ^ PLIF was also implemented in combination with particle image velocimetry and high speed imaging, to understand the blow off behavior of bluff body stabilized flames. Strain information and flame locations, of near blow off flames showed that near blow off flame fronts became increasingly strained leading to local extinction points and possibility of a transition to recirculation <b>zone</b> <b>burning,</b> both dynamics which can provide useful for the future development of controls to prevent blow off.
