40|$|Summary. — Accurate optical {{frequency}} standards employ single trapped and laser cooled ions, we review recent experiments. Optical frequencies can be mea-sured with fractional uncertainties {{of only a}} few parts in 1017 demonstrating the most accurate clocks available today. Demonstrated quantum information techniques help to further improve on determining residual systematic errors. Additionally, entan-glement is also demonstrated to increase the signal to noise ratio.

We estimate that bodies of radius 5, 180 and 70 km are responsible for initiating the collisional cascade accounting for the dust production for AU-Mic, Beta-Pic and Fomalhaut's disks, respectively, at break radii from the star where their surface brightness profiles change slope. Larger bodies, of radius 1000 km and with surface density of order 0. 01 g/cm^ 2, are required to explain the thickness of these disks assuming that they are heated by gravitational stirring.

40|$|The known {{irregular}} satellites of {{the giant}} planets are dormant comet-like objects that reside on stable prograde and retrograde orbits in a realm where planetary perturbations are only slightly larger than solar ones. Their size distributions and total numbers are surprisingly comparable to one another, with the observed populations at Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus having remarkably shallow power-law slopes for objects larger than 8 – 10 km in diameter. Recent modeling work indicates {{that they may have}} been dynamically captured during a violent reshuffling event {{of the giant}} planets ∼ 3. 9 billion years ago that led to the clearing of an enormous, 35 M ⊕ disk of comet-like objects (i. e., the Nice model). Multiple close encounters between the giant planets at this time allowed some scattered comets near the encounters to be captured via three-body reactions. This implies the irregular satellites should be closely related to other dormant comet-like populations that presumably were produced at the same time from the same disk of objects (e. g., Trojan asteroids, Kuiper <b>Belt,</b> scattered <b>disk).</b> A critical problem with this idea, however, is that the size distribution of the Trojan asteroids and other related populations do not look at all like the irregular satellites. Here we use numerical codes to investigate whether collisional evolution between the irregular satellites over the last ∼ 3. 9 Gyr is sufficient to explain this difference. Starting with Trojan asteroid-like size distributions and testing a range of physical properties, we found that our model irregular satellite populations literally self-destruc...|$|R

50|$|Planetesimals {{from the}} outer disc are {{embedded}} {{in all parts of}} the asteroid belt, remaining as P- and D-type asteroids. While Jupiter's resonances sweep across the asteroid <b>belt,</b> outer <b>disk</b> planetesimals are captured by its inner resonances, evolve to lower eccentricities via secular resonances with in these resonances, and are released onto stable orbits as Jupiter's resonances move on. Other planetesimals are implanted in the asteroid belt during encounters with the ice giant, either directly leaving them with aphelia higher than that of the ice giant's perihelia, or by removing them from a resonance. Jumps in Jupiter's semi-major axis during its encounters with the ice giant shift the locations of its resonances, releasing some objects and capturing others. Many of those remaining after its final jump, along with others captured by the sweeping resonances as Jupiter migrates to its current location, survive as parts of the resonant populations such as the Hildas, Thule, and those in the 2:1 resonance. Objects originating in the asteroid belt can also be captured in the 2:1 resonance, along with a few among the Hilda population. The excursions the ice giant makes into the asteroid belt allows the icy planetesimals to be implanted farther into the asteroid belt, with a few reaching the inner asteroid belt with semi-major axis less than 2.5 AU. Some objects later drift into unstable resonances due to diffusion or the Yarkovsky effect and enter Earth-crossing orbits, with the Tagish Lake meteorite representing a possible fragment of an object that originated in the outer planetesimal disk. Numerical simulations of this process can roughly reproduce the distribution of P- and D-type asteroids and the size of the largest bodies, with differences such as an excess of objects smaller than 10 km being attributed to losses from collisions or the Yarkovsky effect, and the specific evolution of the planets in the model.|$|R
40|$|Models for {{the steady}} state collisional {{evolution}} of low eccentricity planetesimal <b>belts</b> identify debris <b>disks</b> with hot dust at 1 AU, like Corvi and HD 69830, as anomalous since collisional processing should have removed {{most of the}} planetesimal mass over their> 1 Gyr lifetimes. This paper looks at the effect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e 0 : 3) on their col-lisional lifetime {{and the amount of}} mass that can remain at late times Mlate. Assuming an axisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we find that Mlate / e 5 = 3 (1 + e) 4 = 3 (1 e) 3. For a scattered disk-like population (i. e., with common pericentre but range of eccentricities), in the absence of dynamical evolution, the mass evolu-tion at late times would be as if only planetesimals with the largest eccentricity were present in the disk. Despite the increased remaining mass, higher eccentricities do not increase the amount of hot emission from the collisional cascade until e> 0 : 99, partly because most collisions occur near pericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high eccentricities (e> 0 : 97) the blow-out population extending outwards from pericentre ma...|$|R
40|$|The Kuiper <b>belt</b> is a <b>disk</b> of icy {{bodies that}} orbit the Sun beyond Neptune; the largest known members are Pluto and its {{companion}} Charon. A few per cent of Kuiper-belt bodies {{have recently been}} found to be binaries with wide separations and mass ratios of the order of unity. Collisions were too infrequent to account for the observed number of binaries, implying that these binaries formed through collisionless interactions mediated by gravity. These interactions are likely to have been most effective during the period of runaway accretion, early in the Solar System's history. Here we show that a transient binary forms when two large bodies penetrate one another's Hill sphere (the region where their mutual forces are larger than the tidal force of the Sun). The loss of energy needed to stabilize the binary orbit can then occur either through dynamical friction from surrounding small bodies, or through the gravitational scattering of a third large body. Our estimates slightly favour the former mechanism.

40|$|The Kuiper belt is a {{population}} of small bodies located outside Neptune's orbit. The observed Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) {{can be divided into}} several subclasses based on their dynamical structure. I construct models for these subclasses and use numerical integrations to investigate their long-term evolution. I use these models to quantify the connection between the Kuiper belt and the Centaurs (objects whose orbits cross the orbits of the giant planets) and the short-period comets in the inner solar system. I discuss how these connections could be used to determine the physical properties of KBOs and what future observations could conclusively link the comets and Centaurs to specific Kuiper belt subclasses. The Kuiper belt's structure is determined by a combination of long-term evolution and its formation history. The large eccentricities and inclinations of some KBOs and the prevalence of KBOs in mean motion resonances with Neptune are evidence that much of the Kuiper belt's structure originated during the solar system's epoch of giant planet migration; planet migration can sculpt the Kuiper <b>belt's</b> scattered <b>disk,</b> capture objects into mean motion resonances, and dynamically excite KBOs. Different models for planet migration predict different formation locations for the subclasses of the Kuiper belt, which might result in different size distributions and compositions between the subclasses; the high-inclination portion of the classical Kuiper belt is hypothesized to have formed closer to the Sun than the low-inclination classical Kuiper belt. I use my model of the classical Kuiper belt to show that these two populations remain largely dynamically separate over long timescales, so primordial physical differences could be maintained until the present day. The current Kuiper belt is much less massive than the total mass required to form its largest members. It must have undergone a mass depletion event, which is likely related to planet migration. The Haumea collisional family dates from the end of this process. I apply long-term evolution to family formation models and determine how they can be observationally tested.

40|$|Collisions {{resulting}} in fragmentation {{are important in}} shaping the mass spectrum of minor bodies in the asteroid belt, the Kuiper <b>belt,</b> and debris <b>disks.</b> Models of fragmentation cascades typically find that in steady-state, the solution for the particle mass distribution is a power law in the mass. However, previous studies have typically assumed that {{the mass of the}} largest fragment produced in a collision with just enough energy to shatter the target and disperse half its mass to infinity is directly proportional to the target mass. We show that if this assumption is not satisfied, then the power law solution for the steady-state particle mass distribution is modified by a multiplicative factor, which is a slowly varying function of the mass. We derive analytic solutions for this correction factor and confirm our results numerically. We find that this correction factor proves important when extrapolating over many orders of magnitude in mass, such as when inferring the number of large objects in a system based on infrared observations. In the course of our work, we have also discovered an unrelated type of non-power law behavior: waves can persist in the mass distribution of objects {{even in the absence of}} upper or lower cutoffs to the mass distribution or breaks in the strength law.

40|$|Motivated by the {{holographic}} principle, {{within the}} context of the AdS/CFT Correspondence in the large t'Hooft limit, we investigate how the geometry of certain highly symmetric bulk spacetimes can be recovered given information of physical quantities in the dual boundary CFT. In particular, we use the existence of bulk-cone singularities (relating the location of operator insertion points of singular boundary correlation functions to the endpoints of boundary-to boundary null geodesics in the bulk spacetime) and the holographic entanglement entropy proposal (relating the entanglement entropy of certain subsystems on the boundary to the area of static minimal surfaces) to recover the bulk metric. Using null and zero-energy spacelike boundary-to-boundary geodesic probes, we show that for classes of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes, one can find analytic expressions for extracting the metric functions given boundary data. We find that if the spacetime admits null circular orbits, the bulk geometry can only be recovered from the boundary, down to the radius of null circular orbits. We illustrate this for various analytic and numerical boundary functions of endpoint separation of null and spacelike geodesics. We then extend our analysis to higher dimensional minimal surface probes within a class of static, planar symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We again find analytic and perturbative expressions for the metric function in terms of the entanglement entropy of straight <b>belt</b> and circular <b>disk</b> subsystems of the boundary theory respectively.
