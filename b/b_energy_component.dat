Analysis is performed both in resonance (B[*]=[*] 0. 087 [*]T) and off-resonance conditions (B[*]=[*] 0. 120 [*]T), at two pressures (0. 38 [*]Pa and 0. 62 [*]Pa), respectively, and for different incident microwave powers. The important effect of the magnetic field on the electron kinetic is discussed, and a critical analysis of Langmuir probe measurements is given. The Electron Energy Distribution Function is calculated using the Druyvesteyn theory (EEDF) and is corrected using the theory developed by Arslanbekov {{in the case of}} magnetized plasma. Three different components are observed in the EEDF, whatever the theory used. They are: (a) a low electron <b>energy</b> <b>component</b> at <b>energy</b> lower than 10 [*]eV, which is ascribed to the electron having inelastic collisions with heavy species (H 2, H, ions), (<b>b)</b> a high <b>energy</b> <b>component</b> with a mean energy ranging from 10 to 20 [*]eV, which is generally ascribed to the heating of the plasma by the incident microwave power, and (c) a third component observed between the two other ones, mainly at low pressure and in resonance conditions, has been correlated to the electron rotation in the magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is devoted}} {{to the study of the}} Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) during the decay (afterglow) of a pulsed magnetoplasma working at 2. 45 GHz in H 2. The {{experiments}} are performed under resonance (B= 0. 087 T) and off resonance (B= 0. 120 T) conditions, at low (0. 38 Pa) and high pressure (0. 62 Pa) for incoming power ranging from 300 W to 1500 W. At steady state i. e. before the discharge decay, the EEDF profile exhibits three main components of which amplitude changes under experimental conditions. A low <b>energy</b> <b>component</b> (εe< 10 eV) is observed whatever experimental conditions are. An intermediate <b>energy</b> <b>component</b> is observed at energy ranging from 5 eV to 15 eV under resonance conditions.

Standard fitting methods are used to study the change of the different EEDF components versus time during afterglow.

The different decay characteristic times are discussed and the results are correlated to the electron recombination processes in the discharge, to the reminiscent incoming power observed up to 30 μs, and to the peak observed in the reflected power during decays.
