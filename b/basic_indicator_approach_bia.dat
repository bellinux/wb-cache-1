40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{modeling}} the real operational data of an anonymous Central European Bank. We have utilized two main approaches {{described in the}} literature: the Loss Distribution Approach and Extreme Value Theory, {{in which we have}} used two estimation methods- the standard maximum likelihood estimation method and the probability weighted moments (PWM). Our results proved a heavy-tailed pattern of operational risk data as documented by many researchers. Additionally, our research showed that the PWM is quite consistent when the data is limited as it was able to provide reasonable and consistent capital estimates. Our result show that when using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) rather than the <b>Basic</b> <b>Indicator</b> <b>Approach</b> (<b>BIA)</b> used in Basel II, the researched bank might save approx. 6 - 7 % of its capital requirement on operational risk. From a policy perspective it should be hence noted that banks from emerging markets such as the Central Europe are also able to register operational risk events and the distribution of these risk events can be estimated wit...|$|E
40|$|Following the Basel II Accord, {{with the}} {{increased}} focus on operational risk as an aspect distinct from credit and market risk, quantification of operational risk {{has been a major}} challenge for banks. This paper analyzes implications of the advanced measurement approach to estimate the operational risk. When modeling the severity of losses in a realistic manner, our preliminary tests indicate that classic distributions are unable to fit the entire range of operational risk data samples (collected from public information sources) well. Then, we propose a piecewise-defined severity distribution (PSD) that combines a parameter form for ordinary losses and a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) for large losses, and estimate operational risk by the loss distribution approach (LDA) with Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the operational risk measured with piecewise-defined severity distribution based LDA (PSD-LDA) with those obtained from the <b>basic</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>approach</b> (<b>BIA),</b> and the ratios of operational risk regulatory capital of some major international banks with those of Chinese commercial banks. The empirical results reveal the rationality and promise of application of the PSD-LDA for Chinese national commercial banks.

40|$|Operational risk has {{attracted}} a sizeable amount of attention {{in recent years as}} a result of massive operational losses that headlined financial markets across the world. The operational risk losses have been on the back of litigation cases and regulatory fines, some of which originated from the 2008 global financial crisis. As a result it is compulsory for financial institutions to reserve capital for the operational risk exposures inherent in their business activities. Local financial institutions are free to use any of the following operational risk capital estimation methods: Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), the Standardized (TSA) and/ the <b>Basic</b> <b>Indicator</b> <b>Approach</b> (<b>BIA).</b> The BIA and TSA are predetermined by the Reserve Bank, whilst AMA relies on internally generated methodologies. Estimation approaches employed in this study were initially introduced by the BCBS, largely premised on an increasingly sophisticated technique to incentivise banks to continually advance their management and measurement methods while benefiting from a lower capital charge through gradating from the least to the most sophisticated measurement tool. However, in contrast to BCBS's premise, Sundmacher (2007), whilst using a hypothetical example, finds that depending on a financial institution's distribution of its Gross Income, the incentive to move from BIA to TSA is nonexistent or marginal at best. In this thesis I extend Sundmacher (2007) 's work, and I test one instance of AMA regulatory capital (RegCap) against that of TSA in a bid to crystalise the rand benefit that financial institutions stand to attain (if at all) should they move from TSA to AMA. A Loss Distribution Approach (LDA), coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation, were used in modelling AMA. In modelling the loss severities, the Lognormal, Weibull, Burr, Generalized Pareto, Pareto and Gamma distributions were considered, whilst the Poisson distribution was used for modelling operational loss frequency. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Akaike information criterion tests were respectively used for assessing the level of distribution fit and for model selection. The robustness and stability of the model were gauged using stress testing and bootstrap. The TSA modelling design involved using predetermined beta values for different business lines specified by the BCBS. The findings show that the Lognormal and Burr distributions best describes the empirical data. Additionally, there is a substantial incentive in terms of the rand benefit of migrating from TSA to AMA in estimating operational risk capital. The initial benefit could be directed towards changes in information technology systems in order to effect the change from TSA to AMA. Notwithstanding that the data set used in this thesis is restricted to just one of the "big four banks" (owing to proprietary restrictions), the methodology is representable (or generalisable) to the other big banks within South Africa. The scope of this study can further be extended to cover Extreme Value Theory, Non-Parametric Empirical Sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bayesian Approaches in estimating operational risk capital...|$|E

The <b>basic</b> <b>indicator,</b> standard and internal measurement approaches (IMA) have been used to asses the capital requirement levels needed to cover the operational risk. The IMA is implemented using the loss distribution methodology (LDA). The capital at risk is computed from the loss distribution that aggregates, using Monte-Carlo simulations, the frequency and loss size distributions, fitted to the empirical data, for each business line and event type pair. Even though IMA is more costly and difficult to implement, it has, in some circumstances, considerable rewards in terms of capital requirements. operational risk, <b>basic</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>approach,</b> standardized approach, internal measurement approach, loss distribution methodology, Monte-Carlo simulation...|$|R
