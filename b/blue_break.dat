Out on deck again, I saw Captain West on the poop, hands still in pockets, quite uninterested, gazing at a <b>blue</b> <b>break</b> in the sky to the north-east. More than the mates and the maniac, more than the drunken callousness of the men, did this quiet figure, hands in pockets, impress upon me that I was {{in a different world}} from any I had known.|$|E

50|$|Snow at Argenteuil (Rue sous la neige, Argenteuil) is an oil-on-canvas {{landscape}} painting from the Impressionist artist Claude Monet. It {{is the largest}} of no fewer than eighteen works Monet painted of his home commune of Argenteuil while it was under a blanket of snow {{during the winter of}} 1874-1875. This painting—number 352 in Wildenstein’s catalogue of the works of Monet—is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker <b>blues</b> <b>breaks</b> up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.|$|R
