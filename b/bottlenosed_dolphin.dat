50|$|The {{modeling}} of human language in animals {{is known as}} animal language research. In addition to the ape-language experiments mentioned above, {{there have also been}} more or less successful attempts to teach language or language-like behavior to some non-primate species, including parrots and great spotted woodpeckers. Arguing from his own results with the animal Nim Chimpsky and his analysis of others results, Herbert Terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences. Shortly thereafter Louis Herman published research on artificial language comprehension in the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Herman, Richards, & Wolz, 1984). Though this sort of research has been controversial, especially among cognitive linguists, many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words, and that some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations, but {{there is little evidence that}} any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984 {{during this}} anti-Animal Language backlash, Louis Herman {{published}} {{an account of}} artificial language in the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> in the journal Cognition. A major difference between Herman's work and previous research was his emphasis on a method of studying language comprehension only (rather than language comprehension and production by the animal(s)), which enabled rigorous controls and statistical tests, largely because he was limiting his researchers to evaluating the animals' physical behaviors (in response to sentences) with blinded observers, rather than attempting to interpret possible language utterances or productions. The dolphins' names here were Akeakamai and Phoenix. Irene Pepperberg used the vocal modality for language production and comprehension in an African grey parrot named Alex in the verbal mode, and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh continues to study bonobos such as Kanzi and Panbanisha.

The recorded sound was analysed by the sound spectrograph. The false killer whale is taxonomically close to the killer whale (Orcinusow), but the feeding migration of the false killer whale in winter is mixed with the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops gilli) and also the {{underwater sound}} of the false killer whale bears a remarkable resemblance to that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The underwater sound of the false killer whale is divided into three types of signals, that is, whistle, clicks, and stratiform sound, and the function of these signals is the very same as that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The whistle is in the range from 5 to 10 kc being identical to that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin.</b> However, unlike in the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin,</b> it is rather toneless and its sound spectorographic pattern is parallel to the abscissa. Next, the frequency of the clicks is not so high being within the limit below 13 kc, but the repetition rate of the clicks is full of variety ranging from 2 -per-second to 100 -per-second. Finally, the stratiform sound which is observed at the time of feeding and in the course of courtship is the same as that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin.</b> Generally speaking, these three types of signals are almost the same as those of the <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin,</b> but vary much more than the latter. !?﻿ 1. The underwater sound of the false killer whales had been recorded since 1960 mainly at the Shimonoseki Aquarium and partly at the sea area of Iki-Tsushima. 2. The underwater sound of the false killer whales is roughly classified into three types of signals, i. e., whistle, clicks and stratiform sound. 3.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} Schull, Smith, and Washburn's findings that rats were unable to monitor their own uncertainty states unlike Humans, Rhesus Monkeys, and the <b>Bottlenosed</b> <b>Dolphin.</b> The researchers point to literature that reveal shortcomings in efforts to show metacognition in young children as analogous to faults in the Schull, Smith, and Washburn study. Children had difficulty monitoring their own uncertainty states when presented with problems that were propositionally represented but were successful when problems were represented by concrete stimuli (Byrnes & Overton, 1986). Rats might also benefit from more concretely represented problems. Presenting rats with more concrete and ecologically appropriate stimuli in a test for uncertainty monitoring might reveal the rats ability to monitor their own uncertainty states. In the present study, experimenters hypothesized that, given a discrimination task, the rats would "bailout" when the information provided was too ambiguous to perform above chance on the task.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the responses of a <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops truncatus) to "normal" (semantically and syntactically correct) sequences of gestures and to anomalous sequences given within an artificial gestural language highly familiar to the animal. Anomalous sequences violated the semantic rules or syntactic constraints of the language. The dolphin discriminated anomalous from normal sequences in that rejections (refusals to respond) occurred to some anomalous sequences but never to normal sequences. Rejections rarely occurred, however, if the anomalous sequence contained a subset of gestures that would comprise a normal unit if joined together. Such units were typically perceived by the dolphin and responded to even if they consisted of gestures that were not sequentially adjacent. All semantic elements of a sequence were processed by the dolphin {{in relation to other}} elements before the dolphin organized its final response. The results show the importance of both semantic properties and semantic relations of the referents of the gestures and of syntactic (ordering) constraints in the dolphin's interpretations of the anomalies.
