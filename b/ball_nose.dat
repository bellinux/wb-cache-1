50|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>nose</b> cutters or {{ball end}} mills (lower row in image) {{are similar to}} slot drills, but {{the end of the}} cutters are hemispherical. They are ideal for {{machining}} 3-dimensional contoured shapes in machining centres, for example in moulds and dies.

50|$|Most CNC milling {{machines}} (also called machining centers) are computer controlled vertical mills {{with the ability}} to move the spindle vertically along the Z-axis. This extra degree of freedom permits their use in diesinking, engraving applications, and 2.5D surfaces such as relief sculptures. When combined with the use of conical tools or a <b>ball</b> <b>nose</b> cutter, it also significantly improves milling precision without impacting speed, providing a cost-efficient alternative to most flat-surface hand-engraving work.|$|E
50|$|End mills (middle row in image) {{are those}} tools which have cutting teeth at one end, {{as well as}} on the sides.

They are usually made from high speed steel or cemented carbide, and have one or more flutes. They are the most common tool used in a vertical mill.|$|R

A <b>ball</b> <b>nose</b> end mill has a semi-sphere at the end tool and has very complex machining mechanism in chip generations. <b>Ball</b> <b>nose</b> cutters cut with the radius of the ball, from the tip of the tool to the tangency point at full diameter.

The cutting parameter in this project are spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The machine used in this project is Makino KE 55 CNC milling machine. The impact of end mill tool geometry on the surface roughness was determined by the testing the workpiece using Surface Roughness Tester.

40|$|The {{application}} of titanium alloys are increasingly seen at aerospace, marine, bio-medical and precision engineering {{due to its}} high strength to weight ratio and high temperature properties. However, while machining the titanium alloys using solid carbide tools, even with jet infusion of coolant lower tool life was vividly seen. The high temperatures generated at the tool–work interface causes adhesion of work-material on the cutting edges; hence, shorter tool life was reported. To reduce the high tool–work interface temperature positive rake angle, higher primary relief and higher secondary relief were configured on the <b>ball</b> <b>nose</b> end-mill cutting edges. However, after an initial working period, the growth of flank wear facilitates higher cutting forces followed by work-material adhesion on the cutting edges. Therefore, {{it is important to}} blend the strength, sharpness and surface integrity on the cutting edges so that the <b>ball</b> <b>nose</b> end mill would demonstrate an extended tool-life. Presently, validation of tool geometry is very tedious as it requires extensive machining experiments. This paper illustrates a new feature-based ball-noseend-mill–work interface model with correlations to the material removal mechanisms by which the tool geometry optimization becomes easier. The data are further deployed to develop a multi-sensory feature extraction/correlation model to predict the performance using wavelet analysis and Wagner Ville distribution. Conclusively, this method enables to evaluate the different <b>ball</b> <b>nose</b> end mill geometry and reduces the product development cycle time...|$|E

The machined surface has been analyzed and the kinematic topography, influenced by the process parameters and the geometry of the cutting tool, has been computed. By subtracting the surface measurements from the computed topography, the stochastic topography of the machined surface, e. g. roughness and cracks, can be determined.

40|$|CrAlYN/CrN {{coatings}} {{represent a}} new generation Ti-free PVD coatings tailored to serve high temperature applications such as dry high speed machining and protection of special grades aerospace and automotive alloys against environmental attack. The novel High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS) technique was used for substrate pre-treatment (etching) followed by coating deposition utilising Unbalanced Magnetron Sputtering (UBM). The employment of HIPIMS resulted in smooth (R-a = 0. 036 mu m) and well adherent films with typical scratch adhesion critical load values on M 2 high speed steel of L-C = 65 N. Low-angle XRD analysis showed that the coating has a nanoscale multilayer (superlattice) structure with a typical bi-layer thickness of 4 nm. XTEM observations confirmed this result and further revealed the dense, growth defect free structure of the coating due to the HIPIMS etching. CrAlYN/CrN combines high hardness of HK 0. 025 = 3320 with a low coefficient of friction of 0. 5 and an exceptionally low sliding wear coefficient of 3. 7 x 10 (- 17) m(3) N- 1 m(- 2), which is {{comparable to that of}} TiAlN/VN and Me-Carbon films. In dry high speed milling (V-cutting = 385 m min(- 1)) of hardened A 2 tool steel (HRC = 58), 8 min cemented carbide <b>ball</b> <b>nosed</b> end mills coated with CrAlYN/CrN outperformed TiAlCrYN, {{which is one of the}} market leading coatings dedicated to this application.

One such problem appears in brain tumor imaging, where baseline and follow-up image volumes from a tu- mor patient are often to-be compared.

Contrast enhanced T 1 -weighted MR images are widely used in clinical practice for monitoring brain tumors. Over this modality, con- tours of the active tumor cells and whole tumor borders and margins are visually enhanced. In this study, a new technique to register serial contrast enhanced T 1 weighted MR images is presented. The proposed fully-automated method is based on five anatomical landmarks: eye <b>balls,</b> <b>nose,</b> confluence of sagittal sinus, and apex of superior sagittal sinus. Af- ter extraction of anatomical landmarks from fixed and moving volumes, an affine transformation is estimated by minimizing the sum of squared distances between the landmark coordinates.

The combination of the optimal level for each factor are used to study again in the confirmation experiment and the result show that polishing time was a dominant parameter for the surface roughness and the next was depth of penetration.

40|$|The multiaxis {{machining}} technology using a non-rotating cutting tool {{can produce a}} well-finished surface with little machining damage or roughness, {{and can be used}} to remove the remaining material in a concavity formed by the <b>ball</b> <b>nosed</b> end mill. This technique will extend the machining limits beyond the processing capability of the rotating tool. However, the single-blade non-rotating tool does not have a long life nor a flexibility for cutting various shapes. Therefore, a cylindrical non-rotating tool with long life and multiusability has been developed. This tool machines using a sharp blade having a wide curvature which gets shape by its inclination toward the feed direction. The cylindrical non-rotating tool can precisely machine a wide surface always with a sharp portion of the blade, because it can perform cutting at an arbitrary position on the blade due to spindle axis turn positioning. On the other hand, non-rotating machining with μm-scale cutting depth requires more precise CL data than is necessary with a rotating tool. If such CL data are generated by existing methods, a greatly increased quantity of data results, and more time is required to generate an offset surface. However, the copy simulation CAM method for multiaxis machining has been developed, which makes it possible to calculate highly precise CL data without offset processing. The imaginary stylus of this copy simulation CAM method traces on a surface of the defined shape while it self-determines the distance and course to the defined shape. Therefore, it is easy to determine the necessary tool axis vector for multiaxis machining, and the present method can generate highly precise CL data for non-rotating cutting. Results of machining experiments with this CAM method and the cylindrical non-rotating tool show that (1) it was able to get a good surface with approximate roughness of 2 μmRy by smoothing machining, (2) it was able to completely removed material remaining in the concavity formed by a ball-nosed end mill, (3) the non-rotating tool and copy simulation CAM method for multiaxis machining can significantly extend the machining limits...|$|R
