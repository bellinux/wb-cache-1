40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to understand the vertical electric field stimulation of the bacterial cells, when grown on amorphous carbon substrates in vitro. In particular, the antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli are studied using MTTassay, live/dead assay and inner membrane permeabilization assays. In our experiments, the carbon substrate acts as one electrode and the counter electrode is positioned outside the culture medium, thus suppressing the current, electrokinetic motions and chemical reactions. Guided by similar experiments conducted in our group on neuroblastoma cells, the present experimental results further establish the interdependence of field strength and exposure duration towards <b>bacterial</b> growth <b>inactivation</b> in vitro. Importantly, significant reduction in bacterial viability was recorded at the 2. 5 V/cm electric field stimulation conditions, which does not reduce the neural cell viability to any significant extent on an identical substrate. Following electrical stimulation, the bacterial growth is significantly inhibited for S. aureus bacterial strain in an exposure time dependent manner. In summary, our experiments establish {{the effectiveness of the}} vertical electric field towards <b>bacterial</b> growth <b>inactivation</b> on amorphous carbon substrates, which is a cell type dependent phenomenon (Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative).

50|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that <b>bacterial</b> <b>inactivation</b> by HOCl {{is the result of}} inhibition of DNA replication. When bacteria are exposed to HOCl, there is a precipitous decline in DNA synthesis that precedes inhibition of protein synthesis, and closely parallels loss of viability. During bacterial genome replication, the origin of replication (oriC in E. coli) binds to proteins that are associated with the cell membrane, and it was observed that HOCl treatment decreases the affinity of extracted membranes for oriC, and this decreased affinity also parallels loss of viability. A study by Rosen et al. compared the rate of HOCl inhibition of DNA replication of plasmids with different replication origins and found that certain plasmids exhibited a delay in the inhibition of replication when compared to plasmids containing oriC. Rosen’s group proposed that inactivation of membrane proteins involved in DNA replication are the mechanism of action of HOCl.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, Knox et al. {{proposed}} {{the idea that}} inhibition of glucose oxidation {{is a major factor}} in the bacteriocidal nature of chlorine solutions. He proposed that the active agent or agents diffuse across the cytoplasmic membrane to inactivate key sulfhydryl-containing enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. This group was also the first to note that chlorine solutions (HOCl) inhibit sulfhydryl enzymes. Later studies have shown that, at bacteriocidal levels, the cytosol components do not react with HOCl. In agreement with this, McFeters and Camper found that aldolase, an enzyme that Knox et al. proposes would be inactivated, was unaffected by HOCl in vivo. It has been further shown that loss of sulfhydryls does not correlate with inactivation. That leaves the question concerning what causes inhibition of glucose oxidation. The discovery that HOCl blocks induction of β-galactosidase by added lactose led to a possible answer to this question. The uptake of radiolabeled substrates by both ATP hydrolysis and proton co-transport may be blocked by exposure to HOCl preceding loss of viability. From this observation, it proposed that HOCl blocks uptake of nutrients by inactivating transport proteins. The question of loss of glucose oxidation has been further explored in terms of loss of respiration. Venkobachar et al. found that succinic dehydrogenase was inhibited in vitro by HOCl, which led to the investigation of the possibility that disruption of electron transport could be the cause of <b>bacterial</b> <b>inactivation.</b> Albrich et al. subsequently found that HOCl destroys cytochromes and iron-sulfur clusters and observed that oxygen uptake is abolished by HOCl and adenine nucleotides are lost. It was also observed that irreversible oxidation of cytochromes paralleled the loss of respiratory activity. One way of addressing the loss of oxygen uptake was by studying the effects of HOCl on succinate-dependent electron transport. Rosen et al. found that levels of reductable cytochromes in HOCl-treated cells were normal, and these cells were unable to reduce them. Succinate dehydrogenase was also inhibited by HOCl, stopping the flow of electrons to oxygen. Later studies revealed that Ubiquinol oxidase activity ceases first, and the still-active cytochromes reduce the remaining quinone. The cytochromes then pass the electrons to oxygen, which explains why the cytochromes cannot be reoxidized, as observed by Rosen et al. However, this line of inquiry was ended when Albrich et al. found that cellular inactivation precedes loss of respiration by using a flow mixing system that allowed evaluation of viability on much smaller time scales. This group found that cells capable of respiring could not divide after exposure to HOCl.|$|E

40|$|Induction of type I {{interferon}} (IFN) {{in response}} to microbial pathogens depends on a conserved cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The presence of DNA in the cytoplasm activates cGAS, while STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (cdNs) produced by cGAS or from bacterial origins.

Sterilization is an important step in healthcare industry that is attained by utilizing conventional sterilization approaches. It includes heat treatment, use of chemicals like ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and gamma radiation. These methods have drawbacks such as material properties of medical devices could be altered or damaged. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate cheap alternative approaches to achieve sterilization without generating toxic residues. Nonthermal atmospheric plasma is a fourth state of matter that consists of charged particles, positive and negative ions and number of reactive species.

HVACP system was operated at 70 kVRMS and at a frequency of 50 Hz. The two 15 -cm diameter aluminum disk electrodes were separated by a rigid polypropylene container which served as a sample holder and as a dielectric barrier. The distance between the two electrodes was equal to the height of the container (22 mm). The top electrode served as a high voltage electrode and bottom electrode was grounded. The discharge was monitored using electrical probes and an Agilent InfiniVision 2000 X-Series Oscilloscope. Influence of different process parameters on spore inactivation including treatment time, mode of exposure (direct/indirect), and working gas types were mainly evaluated. Effect of relative humidity on HVACP inactivation efficacy was also assessed. The inactivation efficacy was determined using standard colony count method. To assess gas composition following HVACP exposure, optical absorption spectroscopy was used. Results: A strong effect of process parameters on inactivation was observed. Direct exposure to plasma was very effective for spore inactivation, achieving ≥ 6 log cycle reduction of spores in all gas types tested, in only 60 s of treatment time. However, a strong influence of gas type was noted on spore reductions where indirect mode of plasma exposure was utilized. The relative humidity also noted as a critical factor in <b>bacterial</b> spore <b>inactivation</b> by HVACP, where a major role of plasma generated species other than ozone was noted. Conclusion: Overall, a strong influence of process parameters on spore inactivation was noted. Effective in-package <b>bacterial</b> spore <b>inactivation</b> within 30 ‑ 60 s demonstrates the promising potential application of HVACP for sterilization of medical devices and heat sensitive materials...|$|R
40|$|Pyolysin (PLO), the {{hemolytic}} exotoxin {{expressed by}} Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, {{is a member}} of the thiol-activated cytolysin family of <b>bacterial</b> toxins. Insertional <b>inactivation</b> of the plo gene results in loss of expression of PLO with a concomitant loss in hemolytic activity. The plo mutant, PLO- 1, has an approximately 1. 8 -log 10 reduction in the 50 % infectious dose compared to that for wild-type A. pyogenes in a mouse intraperitoneal infection model. Studies involving cochallenge of wild-type and PLO- 1 bacteria resulted in recovery of similar numbers of both strains, suggesting that PLO production is required for survival in vivo. Recombinant, His-tagged PLO (His-PLO) is cytotoxic for mouse peritoneal macrophages and J 774 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Protection against challenge with A. pyogenes could be afforded by vaccination with formalin-inactivated His-PLO, suggesting that PLO is a host-protective antigen, as well as a virulence determinant...|$|R
40|$|Two-component {{regulatory}} systems {{are involved in}} processes important for <b>bacterial</b> pathogenesis. <b>Inactivation</b> of the misR/misS system in Neisseria meningitidis results {{in the loss of}} phosphorylation of the lipooligosaccharide inner core and causes attenuation in a mouse model of meningococcal infection. One hundred seventeen (78 up-regulated and 39 down-regulated) potential regulatory targets of the MisR/MisS (MisR/S) system were identified by transcriptional profiling of the NMBmisR mutant and the parental wild-type meningococcal strain NMB. The regulatory effect was further confirmed in a subset of target genes by quantitative real-time PCR and β-galactosidase transcriptional fusion reporter assays. The MisR regulon includes genes encoding proteins necessary for protein folding in the bacterial cytoplasm and periplasm, transcriptional regulation, metabolism, iron assimilation, and type I protein transport. Mutation in the MisR/S system caused increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and also resulted in decreased susceptibility to complement-mediated killing by normal human serum. To identify the direct targets of MisR regulation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using purified MisR-His 6 protein. Among 22 genes examined, misR directly interacted with 14 promoter regions. Six promoters were further investigated by DNase I protection assays, and a MisR-binding consensus sequence was proposed. Thus, the direct regulatory targets of MisR and the minimal regulon of the meningococcal MisR/S two-component signal transduction system were characterized. These data indicate that the MisR/S system influences a wide range of biological functions in N. meningitidis either directly or via intermediate regulators...|$|R
