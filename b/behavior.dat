It {{is important to note}} that for a <b>behavior</b> modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{mediation}} role of organizational justice perception of administrators’ political and paternalistic leadership <b>behaviors</b> on conflict resolution <b>behaviors.</b> The study was conducted with 330 high school teachers working in the central district area in Elazığ.

While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory <b>behavior</b> to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory <b>behavior</b> exists in nearly all avian lineages.

5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular <b>behavior</b> is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same <b>behavior</b> to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a <b>behavior</b> is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the <b>behavior</b> to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how the interaction of maternal parenting discipline beliefs and physical punishment <b>behaviors</b> was associated with externalizing <b>behaviors</b> in toddlers. Methods. Data was collected through in-person interviews with 80 Mexican-American mothers with toddlers, reporting about their beliefs about discipline, their use of physical discipline, and their toddlers’ externalizing <b>behaviors.</b> Hierarchal linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between the interaction of beliefs and <b>behaviors</b> and externalizing <b>behaviors,</b> while controlling for maternal depression. Results. The interaction of beliefs and <b>behaviors</b> were significantly correlated with externalizing <b>behaviors.</b> There was a positive correlation between spanking frequency and externalizing <b>behaviors</b> when mothers that reported high levels of discipline beliefs, and a negative correlation between spanking frequency and externalizing <b>behaviors</b> in mothers that reported low levels of discipline beliefs. Conclusion.

40|$|Learning from {{demonstration}} {{plays an}} important role in enabling robot to acquire new <b>behaviors</b> from human teachers. Within learning from demonstration, robots learn new tasks by recognizing a set of preprogrammed <b>behaviors</b> or skills as building blocks for new, potentially more complex tasks. One important aspect in this approach is the recognition of the set of <b>behaviors</b> that comprises the entire task. The ability to recognize a complex task as a sequence of simple <b>behaviors</b> enables the robot to generalize better on more complex tasks. In this article, we propose that primitive <b>behaviors</b> can be taught to a robot via learning from demonstration. In our experiment, we teach the robot new <b>behaviors</b> by demonstrating the <b>behaviors</b> to the robot several times. Following that, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network is trained to recognize the <b>behaviors.</b> In this study, we managed to teach at least six <b>behaviors</b> on a NAO humanoid robot and trained a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to recognize the <b>behaviors</b> using the supervised learning scheme. Our result shows that long short-term memory can recognize all the taught <b>behaviors</b> effectively, and it is able to generalize to recognize similar types of <b>behaviors</b> that have not been demonstrated on the robot before. We also show that the long short-term memory is advantageous compared to other neural network frameworks in recognizing the <b>behaviors</b> in the presence of noise in the <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
25|$|Anti-social <b>behavior</b> {{is often}} seen as public <b>behavior</b> that lacks {{judgement}} and consideration for others and may damage them or their property.

25|$|In {{addition}} to these basic principles, antecedent factors also affect <b>behavior.</b> <b>Behavior</b> is punished or reinforced {{in the context of}} whatever stimuli were present just before the <b>behavior</b> was performed, which means that a particular <b>behavior</b> might not be affected in every context, just because it was punished or reinforced in a particular one.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose. To {{present results}} of a scoping review focused on skin cancer risk <b>behaviors</b> and other related health risk <b>behaviors.</b> Skin cancer is highly preventable, yet {{it is the most}} common form of cancer in the United States with {{melanoma}} rates increasing. Limited research has been conducted examining the relationship between skin cancer prevention <b>behaviors</b> and other health risks, yet multiple behavioral health risk interventions have shown great promise for health promotion and reduced health care costs. Methods. Online databases were searched for research articles on skin cancer risk <b>behaviors</b> and related health risk <b>behaviors.</b> Results. Thirty-seven articles met inclusion criteria examining skin cancer <b>behaviors</b> including risk, sun protection <b>behaviors,</b> sunburn, and indoor tanning. The majority of existing studies focused on the relationship between skin cancer prevention <b>behaviors</b> and physical activity, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol abuse. Adults were the primary population of interest with some studies of adolescents. Conclusions. Poor skin cancer prevention <b>behaviors</b> were associated with alcohol use, marijuana use, and smoking among adolescents and adults. Studies on body mass index and physical activity had mixed relationships with skin cancer prevention <b>behaviors</b> and warrant further investigation. Indoor tanning was associated with other risky <b>behaviors</b> but other skin cancer prevention <b>behaviors</b> were not studied...|$|R

Functional analytic psychotherapy is {{one form of}} this approach. By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused {{on the environment and}} context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a <b>behavior</b> ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing <b>behavior</b> as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analyzing bidirectional interactions).|$|E

Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting <b>behavior</b> with patting or other gentler <b>behavior.</b> Shaping is based on a <b>behavior</b> analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} a one-year follow-up longitudinal study of problem <b>behaviors</b> and their correlates.
