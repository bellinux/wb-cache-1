5000|$|GR Profile: 1294cc G1A, five doors. Intended as {{competition}} for such cars as the Austin Maestro HLE, the GR Profile used {{exactly the same}} G1A engine as the lower models in the range, but combined it with subtle aerodynamic improvements and lower rolling resistance tyres to reduce the drag coefficient of the car, with the brochure claiming a fuel economy improvement of 3 miles per gallon at a constant 75 mi/h km/h. The standard equipment list included an instrument lighting rheostat, a digital clock, an engine compartment undershield, a glovebox lamp, a carpeted boot and a <b>boot</b> <b>light.</b> Options included metallic paint, central locking, electric windows, and central locking. It was discontinued sometime in 1988, at {{about the time of}} the introduction of the GLX.|$|E

50|$|Quantian OS is a {{remastering}} of Knoppix/Debian for computational sciences. The {{environment is}} self-configuring and directly bootable CD/DVD that turns any PC or laptop (provided it can boot from cdrom/DVD) into a Linux workstation. Quantian also incorporates clusterKnoppix and adds support for openMosix, including remote <b>booting</b> of <b>light</b> clients in an openMosix terminal server context permitting rapid setup of a SMP cluster computer.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the hypothesis that alterations in shoe gear can affect tibial strains in the human during dynamic loading. Rosette strain gauges were mounted on the medial border of the mid-diaphysis in two human subjects with a new strain gauge bonding technique using methyl methacrylate. Strain measurements were made at this site, the most frequent location for stress fractures in the Israeli Army during treadmill walking and free running while wearing various sport shoes (Rockport ProWalkers and New Balance NBX 900) and army <b>boots</b> (<b>light</b> Israeli infantry, double layered sole israeli infantry, and Zohar Infantry boots). Data were analyzed for only one of the subjects because strain gauge bonding was found to be inadequate at the time of surgical removal in the other subject. No single shoe lowered both the principal tibial compression and tensile strains, and the shear strains. The Zohar boot had the lowest principal compression strains during treadmill walking and mobile running, despite its relatively higher weight and sole durometry...|$|R

2500|$|As {{part of the}} Fellowship of the Ring, Legolas is {{armed with}} a bow and arrows and one [...] "long white knife" [...] which hangs by his side. When the {{fellowship}} attempts to cross Caradhras, Legolas alone remains light-hearted. He is little affected by the blowing winds and snow. He does not even wear <b>boots,</b> only <b>light</b> shoes, and his feet scarcely make imprints on the snow.|$|R
5000|$|Heated {{front seats}} were found {{across the entire}} range, as was a five speed gearbox; {{adjustable}} seatbelt with pre-tensioners; folding two-thirds split rear seats; lockable glovebox with light; and <b>boot</b> and ashtray <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|They are {{sometimes}} considered <b>light</b> <b>boots,</b> and can essentially {{be considered a}} subset of chukka boots or desert boots although vellies {{tend to have a}} lower topline. Veldskoen soles {{are sometimes}} cut from old car tyres rather than crepe rubber.|$|R
50|$|In {{anticipation}} of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Nike released the Elite Series of football boots. The goal was to create faster versions of their shoes, without compromising their most important qualities. In {{order to reduce the}} weight of the CTR, a carbon fiber outsole was added which made the <b>boot</b> 19% <b>lighter.</b> The original colorway for the Elite series was Metallic Mach Purple/Total Orange. These colors were chosen {{to make it easier for}} players to spot each other on the field.|$|R
60|$|After careful search {{they found}} the heavy {{footprints}} at several spots where the snow lay, and near them also found traces of the <b>lighter</b> <b>boots.</b> The trees then grew thicker, but following the line indicated by the footprints, {{they came to the}} spot where he had left the wood.|$|R
60|$|A {{strange thing}} {{happened}} to me, too, that night. When for {{the second or third}} time the crowd was flocking in to view me, my eyes chanced to fall on a figure standing in the clouded light a little apart. He was dressed in a high-peaked hat and a long and seemingly brown cassock-like garment, with buttoned tunic and silver-buckled leather belt. Spurs were on his <b>boots,</b> a <b>light</b> whip in his hand. Aloof, his head a little bowed down, his face in profile, he stood there, framed in the opening, dusky, level-featured, deep-eyed--a Stranger.|$|R
6000|$|Tolerably, for I {{had gone}} up the {{staircase}} in the dark, many a time. I ascended it now, in <b>lighter</b> <b>boots</b> than of yore, and tapped in my old way {{at the door of}} Miss Havisham's room. [...] "Pip's rap," [...] I heard her say, immediately; [...] "come in, Pip." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{mandatory}} {{parts of}} the Swiss uniform are the shirt, the neckerchief, any kind of good hiking <b>boots,</b> a fire <b>lighter</b> and a Swiss army knife. Optional parts are belt, Scout jeans, hat, dagger, etc. A youth receives his/her neckerchief and vulgo (Scout name) from his unit leader in an initiation ceremony.|$|R
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, <b>boots</b> became <b>lighter</b> and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a man}} {{standing}} near a hat marking the spot where gold was first discovered in Placerita Canyon, [s. d. ]. The man is at center and {{is looking at the}} camera with a tool over his shoulder at left. He is wearing baggy light pants, tall dark <b>boots,</b> a <b>light</b> jacket, a light vest, and a dark cap. The hat is on a knee-high pile of rocks at center. A line of dense bushes forms a backdrop for the image. Gold was discovered in Placerita Canyon in 1842, marking the first time the precious metal had been found in California...|$|R
50|$|Terrain {{is usually}} fairly flat, though {{in some regions}} there are vast, rolling sand dunes. The desert {{environment}} can also contain mountains; as in Afghanistan and in certain areas around Israel. Due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the U.S. military has redesigned the uniforms for the different branches of service. All of the uniforms have a digital camouflage pattern that is very effective in the desert environment, and the boots have been changed from the standard polished black <b>boots</b> to <b>light</b> brown colored suede leather boots. These boots are cooler under the intense heat of the desert sun.|$|R
50|$|The aim was {{to reduce}} the amount of time it took to mount {{crampons}} to boots, and to simplify the process, as well as making the combination of <b>boot</b> and crampon <b>lighter.</b> Another advantage is that the system removes straps and bails from the front of the boot reducing the risk of snagging these in use.|$|R
2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures.

30|$|First, the {{presence}} of boots affected the RPE or physiological factors rather than in thermal sensation and sweating responses. Specifically, blood lactate concentration after exercising in NoBoots was as low as in Control and NoJP, which implies that cooling the feet or reducing the mass of protective boots proved most effective for alleviating fatigue and exertion. This suggests that <b>lighter</b> <b>boots</b> or boots designed for easily donning and doffing would effectively reduce firefighters’ metabolic burden.|$|R
50|$|In ice hockey, like in basketball, a buzzer beater is a {{goal that}} is scored just as the clock expires in a period. Unlike in basketball, however, the puck must {{completely}} cross the goal line with 0.1 seconds or more remaining on the clock {{in order for the}} goal to count; if the period expires before the puck completely crosses the goal line, the goal is disallowed and the green <b>light</b> <b>boots</b> up.|$|R

2500|$|The {{tradition}} of senior boots came about in 1914, when the Corps of Cadets changed uniforms from the West Point style. The seniors wanted {{a way to}} differentiate themselves from the other classes, so they began wearing officer boots, which evolved into the senior boots worn today. By 1925, the boot style was integrated into the official cadet uniform, as a [...] "knee-height officer <b>boot,</b> of a <b>light</b> brown or tan." [...] Lucchese's bootery in San Antonio became the main supplier of boots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Read! What! I would as soon {{think of}} wearing trousers. No, no, my friend, never read. Leave {{politics}} alone. When people molest you, shoot 'em--those are my rules. Edinburgh was my home. Had enough reading when I was a boy; heard enough psalm-singing, saw enough scrubbing and scouring to last me my lifetime. My {{father was a}} bookseller in the High Street, near the Cowgate--you know! Mother, she was piousthey were all pious. Uncle, a minister, lived with us. That was all worse than purgatory to me. I was educated at the High School--intended for the ministry, ha, ha! My only pleasure was to get a book of travels in some savage country, skulk into my room, throw off my <b>boots,</b> <b>light</b> a pipe, and {{lie on the floor}} reading--locked up from everyone.

Couldn't bear it; ran away at fifteen, and have never heard a word from home since. What happened? I came here, worked, saved, bought land, cattle; married a wife, lived as I liked to live--am happy.

No ding-donging, black looks, scouring from Monday to Saturday--you couldn't eat your dinner off my kitchen floor.

50|$|The two-week {{retreat from}} the peak proved very challenging. Both climbers had opted for <b>light</b> <b>boots</b> for the summit dash. This, {{combined}} with Herzog losing his gloves near the summit and a night spent bivouacked in a crevasse on the descent with one sleeping bag for four climbers (Lachenal, Gaston Rebuffat, Lionel Terray, and Herzog) resulted in severe frostbite, with consequent gangrene requiring the expedition doctor to perform emergency amputations in the field. Both summit climbers lost all of their toes and Herzog most of his fingers.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 the 164 {{received}} a facelift including new rear and side lamps, a new grille and front bumper, new flush-mounted lift-type exterior door handles, new wing mirrors, {{and a new}} instrument cluster and dashboard which included air ducts. In 1974 the vent wings were eliminated from the front doors, and the 164 {{became one of the}} earliest cars to offer heated seats. A limited edition of the 164, the 164TE was made only in 1974 and only for 3 markets, Great Britain, Germany and Australia. The 164TE had extra accessories fitted as standard, being air conditioning, 4 speaker 8 track player with radio, headlight wipe/wash system, rear head rests and rear reading lamps and a fully carpeted <b>boot</b> with <b>lighting.</b> This more upmarket version was only available in 3 colours, being metallic light blue (colour 111), metallic copper (colour 105) and metallic teal (colour 115).|$|R
5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski <b>boots</b> are also <b>lighter</b> than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{research}} findings {{in favor of}} <b>boot</b> camps in <b>light</b> {{of any of the}} initial intentions. Recidivism rates in the U.S. among former prison inmates and boot camp participants are roughly the same. Yet, the effects of boot camps are controversially disputed, some surveys claiming lower re-offence rates, others showing no change as compared to persons serving normal time. Surveys also show different results concerning the reduction of costs. Critics add that the emphasis on authority can only result in frustration, resentment, anger, short temper, a low self-esteem and aggression rather than respect.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{a bright}} Sunday afternoon; the scene is a secluded little seat half-way {{down the front of}} the Leas, and Kipps is four years older than when he parted from Ann. There is a quite {{perceptible}} down upon his upper lip, and his costume is just as tremendous a [...] "mash" [...] as lies within his means. His collar is so high that it scars his inaggressive jawbone, and his hat has a curly brim, his tie shows taste, his trousers are modestly brilliant, and his <b>boots</b> have <b>light</b> cloth uppers and button at the side. He jabs at the gravel before him with a cheap cane, and glances sideways at Flo Bates, the young lady from the cash desk. She is wearing a brilliant blouse and a gaily trimmed hat. There is an air of fashion about her that might disappear under the analysis of a woman of the world, but which is quite sufficient to make Kipps very proud to be distinguished as her particular [...] "feller," [...] and to be allowed at temperate intervals to use her Christian name.|$|R
50|$|The scene can {{be divided}} in two halves. On the left, there is the very {{luminous}} Bacchus figure, his dominant but relaxed pose somewhat reminiscent of that of Christ in many Last Judgement scenes, who is often shown seated and naked to the waist. Bacchus and the character behind him are represented in the traditional loose robes used for depictions of classical myth. The idealization of the god's face is highlighted by the clear light which illuminates him in a more classicist style. The right side, however, presents some drunkards, men of the streets that invite us to join their party, with a very Spanish atmosphere similar to José de Ribera in style. There is no idealization present in their large and worn-out faces, though the figure kneeling {{in front of the}} god is younger and better dressed than the others, with a sword and tall <b>boots.</b> The <b>light</b> which illuminates Bacchus is absent on this side; the figures are shown with chiaroscuro and have much darker skin.|$|R
