25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, <b>boysenberry,</b> mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E

2500|$|Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged {{for about}} 25 months {{exclusively}} in American oak barrels. Silver Oak’s Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In {{answer to the}} question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak.

[...] The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak’s specifications.

40|$|Oregon is {{the number}} one {{producer}} of blackberries, <b>Boysenberries</b> and Loganberries in the United States. The dominant type of blackberry grown in Oregon is the trailing type which has long, pliable canes and includes several popular cultivars. Other types of blackberries are the erect and semi-erect, but their acreage is small (about 6 % to 8 % of the total blackberry acreage). <b>Boysenberries</b> and Loganberries are also trailing berries but are hybrids (a cross between a blackberry and a raspberry) and are often grouped with blackberries because they have similar plant morphology, production practices, and pests. ● In 2001, Oregon growers produced 36. 1 million pounds of blackberries on 6, 160 acres, with a farm-gate value of $ 14, 042, 000; 4. 2 million pounds of <b>Boysenberries</b> on 1, 380 acres, with a value of $ 2, 583, 000; and 0. 1 million pounds of Loganberries on 70 acres, with a value of $ 50, 000. ● 90 to 95 % of the blackberry crop is processed (frozen, puree, jam, or canned) with the remainder being sold for fresh market. Fresh market berries are generally sold locally while processed berries are sold and used nationally and internationally. ● Average yield per acre of all blackberries is about 6, 000 to 8, 000 pounds, but differences between cultivars do occur and yields can range from 4, 000 to 10, 000 pounds per acre depending on the cultivar. Trailing blackberries are sensitive to cold winter temperatures and hot summer temperatures, each of which can have an adverse effect on yield. ● Production costs for established blackberries range from $ 3, 000 to $ 3, 700 per acre. Production Regions (11, 12) : Almost all of Oregon's blackberries are grown west of the Cascade Mountains in the Willamette Valley. Fertile soils, mild winters and cool summers allow growers to produce high quality berries with good flavor and color. Marion County has the most blackberry acreage in the state (approximately 50 %) ...|$|R
25|$|The wines of Washington State {{are often}} {{characterized}} by their bright fruit flavors and crisp acidity. In recent years, the state's red wines have leaned towards riper, more fruit forward flavors, noticeable tannins and oak influence with moderately high alcohol levels. Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson have described quality examples of Washington wines to exhibit fresh acidity, deep coloring, with bright, intense fruit flavors that can usually {{age in the}} bottle for at least 8 years before the fruit structure starts to fade. Karen MacNeil notes that the red wines of Washington, especially the Cabernets and Merlots, often exhibited lush texture with very concentrated berry flavors reminiscent of the wild fruit found in the Pacific Northwest such as blackberries, <b>boysenberries,</b> cherries and raspberries. The state {{is often described as}} combining New World fruit with Old World style. Paul Gregutt, wine writer for The Seattle Times and Wine Enthusiast describes Washington wines as maintaining strong purity and typicity of varietal flavors with firm, ripe tannins and bright acidity. Gregutt says Washington wines have the potential to combine the structure and polish of French wines with the ripeness and fruit of California wines.|$|R
40|$|Selected {{varieties}} {{of red and}} yellow raspberries (Rubus idaeus) may be successfully grown in Colorado at elevations up to 8, 500 feet. Colorado’s climate is not especially favorable for bramble fruit production, and only red and yellow raspberries are recommended for general cultivation. Several {{varieties of}} blackberries can be grown in the lower-elevation areas of the state. Purple raspberries, <b>boysenberries,</b> loganberries and dewberries require special winter protection and are not recommended for Colorado. Black raspberries are not currently recommended, but new varieties suited to Colorado conditions should be available by 2012. Types There are two growth-types of raspberries: summer-bearing and fall-bearing. Summer-bearing varieties produce flowers and fruit on canes that are in their second year of existence. In Colorado, they typically produce ripe fruit throughout the month of July. Fall-bearing varieties produce flowers and fruit on canes that are {{in their first year}} of existence. In Colorado, they typically produce ripe fruit from early-mid August until freezing night temperatures occur. The traditional varieties are biennial summer-bearers. This means that a given cane will grow vegetatively in its first year, followed by fruiting on that cane in its second year. Fall-bearing raspberries fruit along the upper portions of canes in their first year of growth. These canes may overwinter and produce a light summer crop on their lower portions, but this is at the expense of a reduced fall crop...|$|R
