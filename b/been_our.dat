500|$|As Europe moved towards war in {{the late}} 1930s, Davies opposed the {{appeasement}} policies of the Chamberlain government. He doubted {{the will of the}} British ruling classes to wage a determined war against fascism, and called for a workers' [...] "Popular Front" [...] of resistance to the dictators. After the outbreak of war in September 1939 Davies demanded from the British government [...] "a more specific and detailed statement" [...] of war aims, to allay [...] "suspicions... as to the real and possibly as yet unstated war aims of this country and of France". He criticised Labour's decision in May 1940 to join Churchill's wartime coalition government, and thereafter opposed many of the coalition's domestic policies, such as indiscriminate internment of aliens, restrictions on industrial action, and the suppression of the communist newspaper the Daily Worker. The bitterness of Davies's personal attack on Herbert Morrison, the Home Secretary who had authorised the paper's closure, shocked even the British Communist Party's general secretary, Harry Pollitt, who cautioned Davies that [...] "personal abuse has <b>been</b> <b>our</b> stock-in-trade for twenty years and has got us nowhere".|$|E

[...] Appointed the division's Brigade Major Royal Artillery on 19March 1941, Wilton served under Brigadier Frank Berryman in the Syrian campaign, and was responsible for coordinating operations during the Battle of Merdjayoun in June. [...] Assigned to the staff of Headquarters ICorps, Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade2 (Artillery) on 1November; this would be the final artillery posting of his career. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 25November. On 30December, Wilton was mentioned in despatches for his service with the 7thDivision. He entered the Middle East Staff School at Haifa in January 1942, and graduated in May.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy visited Meyer's {{house and}} suggested, [...] " [...] the wall comes down in outer space? You know, the Klingons have always <b>been</b> <b>our</b> stand-ins for the Russians..." [...] Meyer {{recalled}} that he replied [...] "'Oh, wait a minute! Okay, {{we start with}} an intergalactic Chernobyl! Big explosion! We got no more Klingon Empire...!' And I just spilled out the whole story!" [...] The story deliberately included references to the contemporary political climate; the character of Gorkon was based on Mikhail Gorbachev, while the assassination storyline was Meyer's idea. He thought it was plausible that the Klingon leader who turned soft towards the enemy would be killed like similar peacemakers throughout history: Anwar El Sadat, Gandhi, and Abraham Lincoln. Nimoy's hiring of Meyer was not only beneficial because Meyer knew the material and could write fast (having produced The Wrath of Khans screenplay in twelve days), but if Meyer was to direct it would offset any acrimony from Shatner, whose ire would have been aroused if Nimoy returned to direct his third Star Trek feature after [...] and The Voyage Home. Meyer {{said that when he}} started work on the screenplay it did not occur to him that he would direct the film. Meyer's wife {{was the first person to}} suggest that he should direct.|$|E

We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt."

[...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support."

500|$|Overall {{the quality}} was low, but {{according}} to sf historian Brian Stableford, [...] "sf writers given carte blanche to write pure fantasy for [...] did often produce readable fiction with a distinctive whimsical and ironic flavour". Critic John Clute's assessment {{was that it was}} inconsistent, [...] "but there were some terrific tales in it. Not enough, but some." [...] Notable stories from the post-war era include Theodore Sturgeon's [...] "Largo" [...] and Raymond F. Jones' [...] "The Children's Room". The artwork was generally of higher quality than the stories; Ashley describes Fantastic Adventures as [...] "one of the best-illustrated magazines around". Regular artists included Virgil Finlay, Henry Sharp, Rod Ruth, and Malcolm Smith. In Palmer's words, [...] "It has <b>been</b> <b>our</b> experience that covers sell magazinessimply because they attract attention." [...] For the first year the cover art, while dramatic, was more likely to show an action scene with a male hero than a damsel in distress, but in August 1940 H.W. McCauley's cover showed a glamorous woman in a sparkling dress. Similar covers followed with increasing frequency, with readers and editors giving the various heroines the name of [...] "MacGirl". Science fiction historian Paul Carter, commenting on the change from action scenes to alluring women on the covers, suggests that [...] "surely the war {{had something to do with}} this". Science fiction art often included spaceships as phallic symbols; author and critic Brian Aldiss remarked on a Fantastic Adventures cover, from March 1949, that included a submarine as a phallic symbol instead. Readers' letters often objected to the attractive women and the implied sexual content, but the stories themselves were quite tame.|$|E
