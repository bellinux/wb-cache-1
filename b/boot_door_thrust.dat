6000|$|... "Sir Terence! Sir Terence! For God's sake, Sir Terence!" [...] {{he heard}} the voice of his old servant. Came the loud crash of the <b>door</b> <b>thrust</b> back until it struck the wall and quick steps along the passage.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} an analysis, a model {{creation}} and simulations {{of a car}} <b>boot</b> <b>door</b> mechanism. The problem was analyzed {{on the basis of}} real measurements made on three different vehicles. Based on the measurements, computational models describing the real system at different levels of complexity were created. Matlab/Simulink was used to create and calculate the models. The output of the thesis is the simulator of a car <b>boot</b> <b>door</b> which also includes simplified model of a control unit. The simulator should provide an approximation of current and kinematic quantities of these mechanisms. The model is implemented on dSPACE platform that allows real-time simulations. The simulator can be modified in terms of changing the parameters of the mechanism and modifying some of its results...|$|R
6000|$|The big Scotchman {{held his}} little {{opponent}} in contempt; so that, {{instead of putting}} himself on the defensive, he leaned {{his back against the}} <b>door,</b> <b>thrust</b> his hands into his pockets, and requested to know [...] "what that was to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold!" [...] cried Mactavish, {{vaulting}} the counter, and intercepting Hugh as {{he rushed}} upon his antagonist; [...] "no fighting here, you blackguards! If {{you want to}} do that, go outside the fort;" [...] and Peter, opening the <b>door,</b> <b>thrust</b> the Orkneyman out.|$|R
6000|$|This revived him. 'I'll {{ring the}} alarm bell,' he said, and, putting a small key to an unnoticed keyhole in a panel, {{he opened a}} tiny <b>door,</b> <b>thrust</b> in his hand, and pressed a knob. Instantly from the Castle tower came the thunderous knell of the alarm. 'I had it put in in case of fire or burglars,' {{explained}} the millionaire, adding automatically, 'every modern improvement.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{lines of}} the car had been improved, the floor-level lowered and the body's extra length and width gave more head, leg and elbow room for driver and passengers. It was now easier {{to get into the}} back seat and all four seats had been {{redesigned}} to give better support. The spare wheel was moved outside the car and enclosed in a metal cover. Two handles were now provided to the <b>boot</b> <b>door,</b> one with a lock.|$|R

TV special. Arriving in London in March 1965, the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder were bussed across Britain on a tough but crucial tour. The TV special, recorded after the tour, kicked open the <b>door</b> <b>thrusting</b> Motownś slick routines and magical music into front rooms everywhere...|$|R
6000|$|Right {{that very}} minute {{she heard a}} noise outside that made her hurry to the <b>door</b> and <b>thrust</b> her head out once more. It was Sammy Jay, shrieking: ...|$|R
60|$|The cloak {{was just}} {{arranged}} round {{her when she}} heard the outer <b>door</b> <b>thrust</b> open, and voices speaking in a strange tongue, and arms grounded in the room behind her. Should she wait to be discovered? or should she show herself of her own accord? It was less trying to such a nature as hers to show herself than to wait. She advanced to enter the kitchen. The canvas curtain, as she stretched out her hand to it, was suddenly drawn back from the other side, and three men confronted her in the open doorway.|$|R

60|$|Despairing {{of drawing}} any useful {{information}} from Wilding, his lordship {{was on the}} point of turning to Blake, when quick steps and the rattle of a scabbard sounded without; the <b>door</b> was <b>thrust</b> open without ceremony, and Captain Wentworth reappeared.|$|R
60|$|He had {{forgotten}} his hurt. He caught up {{his hat and}} a coat, and pushed {{her out of the}} room. He locked the <b>door,</b> and <b>thrust</b> the key into his pocket. As they walked down the corridor he lit a cigarette.|$|R
6000|$|The old man {{opened the}} <b>door,</b> and <b>thrusting</b> in his meagre face, {{thatched}} with thin grey locks, and one {{sleeve of his}} white coat, said in a subdued and mysterious tone of voice, [...] "I was wanting to speak to you, sir." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Exeo is a D-segment model, {{which is}} built on the Volkswagen Group B7 (PL46) platform. It is {{essentially}} a rebadged Audi A4 B7 generation, with styling changes {{to the front and}} rear by way of unique bonnet, front wings, <b>boot</b> lid, <b>doors</b> and exterior door mirrors.|$|R
60|$|Duson knocked softly at the <b>door.</b> Mr. Sabin <b>thrust</b> {{the letter}} and {{envelope}} into his breast coat pocket.|$|R
60|$|Caleb crept back to {{the head}} of the stairs and down several steps, which he began to re-ascend noisily, grumbling at their gloom and steepness. Then, before the women even had time to shut the <b>door,</b> he <b>thrust</b> it wide and walked {{straight}} into the room.|$|R
60|$|Sound {{it might}} have been, but long it was not, for {{he had not been}} asleep {{a quarter of an hour}} when the boy opened the <b>door</b> and <b>thrust</b> in his head, which was like a bundle of badly-picked oakum. Quilp was a light sleeper and started up directly.|$|R
5000|$|Unseen by {{the four}} robbers, bank patron Mrs. B. P. Blassengame and her six-year-old {{daughter}}, Frances, entered the bank in hopes of seeing Santa, not knowing a robbery was in progress. Immediately realizing the danger, Mrs. Blassengame charged her way with her daughter through the bookkeeping office of the bank, announcing [...] "They are robbing the bank," [...] as {{she reached for the}} door to the alley. She quickly unlocked the <b>door,</b> <b>thrusting</b> her daughter out into the alley while yelling at her to run and, despite warnings from the robbers that they would shoot, escaping herself. She screamed for help as she ran the one block to city hall and the police department, alerting Chief of Police G. E. (Bit) Bedford and most of the Cisco citizenry about the robbery.|$|R
50|$|Exterior {{features}} {{included a}} slide-out <b>boot,</b> suicide <b>doors</b> and LED lamps {{front and rear}}. The front and rear lamps were created by Jonathan Coles for Isometrix Lighting. The car was painted green after its unveiling in Tokyo and, unusually for an old prototype, has continued to be shown again at various art exhibits.|$|R
50|$|Irmscher {{delivered}} the rally trim for the exterior. Large and widened wings, light weight hood, front wings, rear <b>boot</b> lid and <b>doors</b> were also installed.|$|R
60|$|But Ramiro's {{attention}} {{had been}} diverted from {{me by the}} noise. Half-turning in his chair, he called {{to one of the}} men-at-arms to ascertain who came. Before the fellow could do his bidding, the <b>door</b> was <b>thrust</b> open and Lucagnolo appeared on the threshold, jaded and worn with hard riding.|$|R
5000|$|As for Aristogeiton, Herodotus {{puts him}} not forth {{at the back}} <b>door,</b> but <b>thrusts</b> him {{directly}} {{out of the gate}} into Phoenicia, saying that he had his origins from the Gephyraei, and that the Gephyraei were not, as some think, Euboeans or Eretrians, but Phoenicians, as himself has learned by report.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{clenched his}} fist and sprang at the man as a bull-terrier might leap on a mastiff. Almost {{in the act of}} {{striking}} he changed his mind, and, instead of delivering one of those scientific blows with which he had {{on more than one occasion}} in his past history terminated a fight at its very commencement, he seized Ladoc by the throat, tripped up his heels, and hurled him to the ground with such force, that he lay quite still for at least half a minute! Leaving him there to the care of O'Donel, who had returned, Jack went up to his bedroom, shut the <b>door,</b> <b>thrust</b> his hands into his pockets, and began to pace the floor rapidly, and to shake his head. Gradually his pace became slower, and the shaking of his head more sedate. Presently he soliloquised in an undertone.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilks {{shook the}} hand off and eyed his adviser ferociously. Then {{he took a}} glass from the counter and smashed it on the floor. The next moment the bar was in a ferment, and the landlord, {{gripping}} Mr. Wilks round the middle, skilfully piloted him to the <b>door</b> and <b>thrust</b> him into the road.|$|R
60|$|Exclamations {{of welcome}} burst from some {{person or persons}} when the <b>door</b> was <b>thrust</b> ajar, {{followed}} by the scrape of chairs on a stone floor, as if pushed back by their occupiers in rising from a table. The door was closed again, and nothing could now be heard from within, save a lively chatter and the rattle of plates.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the Refan JT 8 D side engine target thrust {{reverser}} on the stability and control characteristics of the Boeing 727 - 200 airplane were investigated using the Boeing-Vertol 20 x 20 ft Low-Speed Wind Tunnel. A powered model of the 727 - 200 was tested in groud effect in the landing configuration. The Refan target reverser configuration was evaluated relative to the basic production 727 airplane with its clamshell-deflector <b>door</b> <b>thrust</b> reverser design. The Refan configuration had slightly improved directional control characteristics relative to the basic airplane. Clocking the Refan thrust reversers 20 degrees outboard to direct the reverser flow away from the vertical tail, {{had little effect on}} directional control. However, clocking them 20 degrees inboard resulted in a complete loss of rudder effectiveness for speeds greater than 90 knots. Variations in Refan reverser lip/fence geometry had a minor effect on directional control...|$|R
60|$|The carpenter's {{hammer and}} chisel {{disposed}} {{of the resistance}} of the door in a few minutes. But some article of furniture had been placed against it inside, as a barricade. By pushing at the <b>door,</b> we <b>thrust</b> this obstacle aside, and so got admission to the room. The landlord entered first; the Sergeant second; and I third. The other persons present followed us.|$|R
60|$|Brother Thomas moved stealthily to the <b>door,</b> and <b>thrust</b> in {{the wooden}} bolt. Then he sat him heavily {{down on my}} bed, and put his fiend's face close to mine, his eyes {{stabbing}} into my eyes. But I bit my lip, and stared right back into his yellow wolf's eyes, that shone like flames of the pit with evil and cruel thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Gonzaga {{turned to}} Valentina. She sat very still, her tawny head bowed {{and in her}} eyes a look of sore distress. And in that instant a brisk step sounded without. The <b>door</b> was <b>thrust</b> open, and Francesco himself stood upon the threshold, with Peppe's alarmed face showing behind him. Gonzaga instinctively drew back a pace, and his countenance {{lost some of its}} colour.|$|R
60|$|Conducting {{him to the}} <b>door,</b> the sbirro <b>thrust</b> {{him into}} the street, flung his blue gown after him, and advised him to beware of again rousing the wrath of Sidi Omar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drip-drip-drip!" [...] {{repeated}} Archie firmly. [...] "And I put my <b>boots</b> {{outside the}} <b>door</b> when I went to bed, {{and this morning}} they hadn't been touched. I give you my solemn word! Not touched." ...|$|R
60|$|Parker {{was fairly}} hooking his chin over Curtis's {{shoulder}} to hear every word uttered {{and to see}} all that went on, and Curtis {{was in the midst}} of an explanation of the significance of the drama of the dance, when a short, sturdy, bow-legged Tetong, dressed in a policeman's uniform, pushed his way in at the <b>door</b> and <b>thrust</b> a letter at his agent's hand.|$|R
