5|$|Super Meat Boy is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy, who must save his cube-shaped, heavily bandaged girlfriend <b>Bandage</b> Girl from the evil scientist Dr. Fetus. The game is divided into chapters, which together contain over 300 levels. Players attempt to {{reach the end of}} each level, represented by <b>Bandage</b> Girl, while avoiding crumbling blocks, saw blades, and various other fatal obstacles. The player can jump and run on platforms, and can jump off or slide down walls. The core gameplay requires fine control and split-second timing, and was compared to, regarding both gameplay and level of difficulty, traditional platform games such as Super Mario Bros. and Ghosts 'n Goblins.|$|E

25|$|Compression <b>bandaging,</b> {{also called}} wrapping, is the {{application}} of layers of padding and short-stretch <b>bandages</b> to the involved areas. Short-stretch <b>bandages</b> are preferred over long-stretch <b>bandages</b> (such as those normally used to treat sprains), as the long-stretch <b>bandages</b> cannot produce the proper therapeutic tension necessary to safely reduce lymphedema and may in fact end up producing a tourniquet effect. During activity, whether exercise or daily activities, the short-stretch <b>bandages</b> enhance the pumping action of the lymph vessels by providing increased resistance. This encourages lymphatic flow and helps to soften fluid-swollen areas.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective as {{a result}} of a serious {{complication}} from compression <b>bandaging</b> in a patient with venous ulceration and deep-vein obstruction, a policy of incremental compression in such limbs has been developed. The purpose of this retrospective study is to review the outcome of this policy. Design limbs with deep-venous obstruction (stenosis or occlusion) were treated initially with 3 -layer compression <b>bandaging</b> and reviewed 24 h later. If 3 -layer <b>bandaging</b> was tolerated, it was re-applied for a further 48 h. If there were no problems, then 4 -layer <b>bandaging</b> was applied and the patient reviewed at 24 and 72 h. If 4 -layer <b>bandaging</b> could not be tolerated, the limb was returned to 3 -layer <b>bandaging.</b> Results of 325 limbs seen in a venous-ulcer clinic, 22 (7 %) had deep-vein obstruction. Fifteen (68 %) limbs were able to tolerate 4 -layer <b>bandaging,</b> five (23 %) could tolerate 3 -layer <b>bandaging</b> and two limbs (9 %) could only tolerate class 2 compression hosiery. The overall 1 -year healing rate was 55 %. There were no serious complications from <b>bandaging.</b> Conclusions a protocol of incremental compression <b>bandaging</b> is safe in ulcerated legs with deep-vein obstruction and produces healing in up to 55 % of cases...|$|R

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay <b>bandage</b> with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|Some {{clinical}} {{symptoms and}} signs {{have been named}} after Hippocrates as he {{is believed to be}} the first person to describe those.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci {{attracted}} interest from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League group stage matchday one in a 3–0 win over Young Boys. He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time. In late November, Tasci returned to training with a <b>bandage</b> on his right knee. Once again, he was on the sideline after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit. He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich, which Stuttgart lost 5–3. Despite his injury, Tasci would go on to make 26 league appearances. He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E

After completing his injury rehab in his native Australia, Kisnorbo returned to pre-season training for Leeds United a week later than his team mates. After returning from his long injury lay off, and proving his fitness, Kisnorbo signed a new two-year contract at Leeds on 10 July. Kisnorbo revealed he wouldn't be wearing his iconic head <b>bandage</b> for the 2011–12 season as he wanted it to represent a new start for him. Kisnorbo scored the opening goal in the pre-season friendly victory against Newcastle United.

5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final.

40|$|Background: Four-layer <b>bandaging</b> is the {{standard}} treatment for venous leg ulcers but is bulky and can restrict mobility. Two-layer compression stockings have recently been marketed but their clinical and cost effectiveness were unknown. Aim: To compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of four-layer <b>bandaging</b> with two-layer compression stockings. Method: In a pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial 454 participants were randomly allocated two-layer compression stockings or four-layer <b>bandages</b> and followed for up to 12 months after healing. Results: The median time to ulcer healing was almost identical (stockings group: 99 days, <b>bandaging</b> group: 98 days). More patients allocated stockings changed treatment but ulcer recurrence rates {{were higher in the}} <b>bandaging</b> group. Stockings cost £ 302 less per participant per year and had more than 95 % probability of being the most cost-effective treatment. Conclusion: Two-layer compression stockings are a viable, cost-effective alternative to four-layer <b>bandaging</b> but may not be suitable for all patients...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of using amelogenin plus compression <b>bandaging</b> versus compression <b>bandaging</b> alone in treating non-healing venous leg ulcers (VLUs) of over six months duration, {{from the perspective}} of the national health service in England. METHOD: A 12 -month Markov model was constructed that depicted the management of a chronic, non-healing VLU of over six months duration. The model considers the decision by a clinician to treat a recalcitrant VLU with amelogenin plus compression <b>bandaging</b> or compression <b>bandaging</b> alone, and was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of amelogenin plus compression <b>bandaging</b> at 20062007 prices. RESULTS: According to the model, 60 % of all wounds treated with amelogenin plus compression <b>bandaging</b> are expected to heal within 12 months of the start of treatment compared with 41 % of wounds treated with compression <b>bandaging</b> alone (p< 0. 01). Additionally, 23 % of all amelogenin-treated wounds are expected to improve compared with 18 % of wounds in the compression <b>bandaging</b> alone group. This difference in effectiveness between the two groups is expected to lead to a 7 % improvement in health gain among amelogenin-treated patients when compared with those treated with compression <b>bandaging</b> alone (0. 800 versus 0. 746 QALYs; p< 0. 01) at 12 months after the start of treatment. Use of amelogenin is expected to lead a 10 % reduction in NHS cost over 12 months from pound 4, 261 (95 % CI: pound 3, 409; pound 5, 114) to pound 3, 816 (95 % CI: pound 3, 227; pound 4, 405), due in part to a reduction in the requirement for nurse visits. Hence, amelogenin plus compression <b>bandaging</b> was found to be a dominant treatment. Moreover, use of amelogenin is expected to free-up NHS resources for alternative use within the system. CONCLUSION: Within the models limitations, amelogenin plus compression <b>bandaging</b> is expected to afford the NHS a cost-effective dressing compared with compression <b>bandaging</b> alone in the management of chronic non-healing VLUs of more than six months duration. Declaration of interest: This study was sponsored by Mölnlycke Heath Care. The authors have no other conflicts of interest that are directly relevant to the content of this manuscript...|$|R
