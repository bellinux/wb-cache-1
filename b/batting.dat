5|$|Flick {{was known}} {{predominantly}} for his solid <b>batting</b> and speed. He led the National League in RBIs in 1900, {{and led the}} American League in stolen bases in 1904 and 1906, and in <b>batting</b> average in 1905.|$|E
5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun {{from third}} in the <b>batting</b> order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder. The move was expected to allow Braun to steal more, as <b>batting</b> before Fielder was not conducive to him risking being thrown out on steal attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically allow opponents to intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him. At {{the end of the}} month, however, Yost reverted to his previous <b>batting</b> order.|$|E
5|$|Players on the <b>batting</b> team {{take turns}} hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out {{in any of}} several ways. A player on the <b>batting</b> team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to {{subsequent}} bases during teammates' turns <b>batting,</b> such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between <b>batting</b> and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn <b>batting</b> for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and {{the team with the}} greater number of runs {{at the end of the}} game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.|$|E

5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest.

5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who take turns <b>batting</b> and fielding. The <b>batting</b> team {{attempts}} to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.|$|E
