5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{had started}} {{going out to}} dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast {{that she had been}} given the night before. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} September {{and the end of}} December 1941, the Kozara Partisans {{conducted}} around forty {{military operations}} against the enemy. Stojanović helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of Podgradci, Mrakovica, and Turjak. Stojanović argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of Gradiška, and <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans. On 23October 1941, Partisans under Stojanović's command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting. The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of railroad ties, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanović saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Ustaše and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Ustaše were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given a speech by Stojanović before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the Una River.|$|E

5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming {{that she had been}} raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, {{known as the}} Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|E
5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E

5|$|The 1980 {{introduction}} of a veal-based sandwich raised the ire of animal rights groups. By 1982, several groups were alleging that the veal being sourced to Burger King was most likely kept in battery cages, unable to move, and fed a low iron diet designed to produce the lightly toned meat associated with veal. As {{a result of this}} protest, these groups lead a three-country boycott of Burger King in April 1982. Critics of the boycott claimed that the type of veal that was being used was more-likely to be free range veal due to cost issues, claiming that there is simply no way a $2.00 sandwich would use the higher quality $15.00/lb veal. The rights groups refused to back down despite the cost claims because Burger King would only release the name of the meat processor, not its veal suppliers. The chain eventually announced that it intended to pull the sandwich from the market, stating that it was not because of the boycotts but <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lack of consumer demand. In fact, the chain said the sandwich sold best in the markets where the majority of the protests were occurring.|$|E
5|$|In 1294, Wales {{broke out}} in {{rebellion}} led by Madog ap Llywelyn, prince of Wales. As Caernarfon was the centre of administration in Gwynedd and a symbol of English power, it was targeted by the Welsh. Madog's forces captured the town in September, {{and in the process}} heavily damaged the town walls. The castle was defended by just a ditch and a temporary barricade. It was quickly taken and anything flammable was set alight. Fire raged across Caernarfon, leaving destruction in its wake. In the summer of 1295, the English moved to retake Caernarfon. By November the same year, the English began refortifying the town. Rebuilding the town walls was a high priority, and £1,195 (nearly half the sum initially spent on the walls) was spent on completing the job two months ahead of schedule. Attention then shifted to the castle and on finishing the work that had halted in 1292. Once the rebellion was put down, Edward began building Beaumaris Castle on the Isle of Anglesey. The work was overseen by James of Saint George; as a result, Walter of Hereford took over as master mason for the new phase of construction. By the end of 1301, a further £4,500 had been spent on the work with the focus of work on the northern wall and towers. The accounts between November 1301 and September 1304 are missing, possibly <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hiatus in work while labour moved north to help out with England's war against Scotland. Records show that Walter of Hereford had left Caernarfon and was in Carlisle in October 1300; he remained occupied with the Scottish wars until the autumn of 1304 when building at Caernarfon resumed. Walter died in 1309 and his immediate subordinate, Henry of Ellerton, took over the position of master mason. Construction continued at a steady rate until 1330.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E
