40|$|The membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) {{is a novel}} {{treatment}} technology that employs gas-supplying membranes to deliver oxygen directly to a biofilm growing on the membrane surface. When operated with closed-end membranes, the MABR provides 100 -percent oxygen transfer efficiencies (OTE), resulting in significant energy savings. However, closed-end MABRs are more sensitive to <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> inert <b>gases,</b> such as nitrogen. Back-diffusion reduces the average oxygen transfer rates (OTR), consequently decreasing the average contaminant removal fluxes (J). We hypothesized that venting the membrane lumen periodically would increase the OTR and J. Using an experimental flow cell and mathematical modeling, we showed that back-diffusion gas profiles developed over relatively long timescales. Thus, very short ventings could re-establish uniform gas profiles for relatively long time periods. Using modeling, we systematically explored {{the effect of the}} venting interval (time between ventings). At moderate venting intervals, opening the membrane for 20 s every 30 min, the venting significantly increased the average OTR and J without substantially impacting the OTEs. When the interval was short enough, in this case shorter than 20 min, the OTR was actually higher than for continuous open-end operation. Our results show that periodic venting is a promising strategy to combine the advantages of open-end and closed end operation, maximizing both the OTR and OTE.

In this study, the water vapor and current distributions on the anode side of a PEMFC was firstly measured by using the effective visualization tool proposed in our previous work, and the net water transport coefficient was quantitatively estimated under low-humidity conditions. Furthermore, the electro-osmotic drag (EOD) coefficient of Nafion membrane was also measured based on hydrogen pumping method. Therefore, the electro-osmosis and <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> water through the electrolyte membrane in the operating PEMFC can be separately analyzed.

The TDLAS results showed that the MPL imparts mass transport resistance at the cathode side under low-humidity conditions with co-flow and counter-flow modes and enhanced <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> the generated water to the anode side.

40|$|Administration of 25 mg/kg {{uranyl nitrate}} (UN) to rats {{leads to a}} brief period of {{polyuria}} followed by progressive oliguria with death at 5 days. Factors that determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were examined in control Munich-Wistar rats (n equals 16) and 2 h after either 15 mg/kg (n equals 8) or 25 mg/kg (n equals 7) of UN (i. v.) utilizing direct measurements of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures and plasma flow. Total kidney GFR was reduced to 47 % of control in the low dose group and to 21 % in the high dose group. The simultaneous nephron filtration rate (sngfr) was 28. 6 plus or minus 0. 8 nl/min/g kidney wt in control, 29. 1 plus or minus 1. 0 in the low dose group, and 18. 1 plus or minus 1. 2 (P less than 0. 001) in the higher dose group. This disparity in UN effect upon GFR and sngfr was due to tubular <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> solute through damaged epithelia beyond the early proximal tubule as demonstrated by microinjection of inulin and mannitol in the proximal tubule. Inulin "leak" persisted at 6 h after UN when tubular pressure had returned to normal. Comparison of sngfr measured in early vs. late proximal tubule revealed no difference after high dose UN, suggesting no significant leak of inulin from the early proximal tubule, and that the decreased sngfr was due to primary reductions in ultrafiltration. Nephron plasma flow was equal to control at both doses of UN. Also directly measured hydrostatic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary was not changed. The effective filtration pressure achieved equilibrium in control of animals but became significantly positive at the efferent end of the capillary at both doses of UN and increased. Total glomerular permeability (LpA) was progressively reduced from control (0. 089 plus or minus 0. 005 nl/s/g kidney wt/mm Hg) at low dose UN (0. 047 plus or minus 0. 013) and high dose 0. 024 plus or minus 0. 003 nl/s/g kidney wt/mm Hg).

40|$|Industrial alloys are {{generally}} multi-component systems with volatile and highly reactive components. Consequently, their processing in {{the liquid state}} requires special precautions. Therefore, an existing electromagnetic-levitation device with a high-vacuum chamber, designed for surface tension measurements was modified and improved.

40|$|Determining the {{presence}} of conducting filaments in {{resistive random access memory}} with nanoscale thin films is vital to unraveling resistive switching mechanisms. Bistable resistive switching within graphene-oxide (GO) -based resistive memory devices, recently developed by many research groups, has been generally explained by the formation and rupture of conducting filaments induced by the diffusion of metal or oxygen ions. Using a low-voltage spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we directly observe metallic nanofilaments formed at the amorphous top interface layer with the application of external voltages in an Al/GO/Al memory system. Atomic-resolution TEM images acquired at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV clearly show that the conducting nanofilaments are composed of nanosized aluminum crystalline within the amorphous top interface layer after applying a negative bias (ON state). Simultaneously, we observe the change in the crystallinity of GO films by the <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> oxygen ions. The oxygen-deficient regions are clearly confirmed by energy-filtered TEM oxygen elemental mapping. This work could provide strong evidence to confirm the resistive switching mechanism previously suggested by our group. close...|$|R
40|$|The {{steady-state}} electrical {{behavior of}} cation-selective ionophore membranes with {{different kinds of}} ionic additives was studied on a theoretical basis. Membranes with both mobile and fixed anionic sites exhibit nonlinear current–voltage curves, which is {{in contrast with the}} ohmic behavior of pure fixed-site membranes. This can be explained from the specific concentration profiles in the membrane, illustrating pronounced polarization effects for the mobile sites. Surprisingly, the influence of the fixed sites on the current response is still observable even when the mobile sites predominate. At high voltages, current saturation occurs by limitations <b>of</b> the <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> free ionophores. This can be overcome when other, uncomplexed, cations contribute to the current flow. Membranes with both cationic and anionic sites cannot be strongly polarized, in analogy to other systems where an inert electrolyte is confined to a given phase. These membranes respond with current saturation at relatively low voltages. Currents above this limit can be achieved by an additional permeation of anions from the aqueous solution through the membrane, as shown by model calculations...|$|R

40|$|The direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cell}} (DMFC) is ideal if high energy-density liquid fuels are required. Liquid fuels have advantages over compressed hydrogen including higher energy density {{and ease of}} handling. Although state-of-the-art DMFCs exhibit manageable degradation rates, excessive fuel crossover diminishes system energy and power density. Although use of dilute methanol mitigates crossover, the concomitant lowering of the gross fuel energy density (GFED) demands a complex balance-of-plant (BOP) that includes higher flow rates, external exhaust recirculation, etc. An alternative approach is redesign of the fuel delivery system to accommodate concentrated methanol. NuVant Systems Inc. (NuVant) will maximize the GFED by design and assembly of a DMFC that uses near neat methanol. The approach is to tune the diffusion of highly concentrated methanol (to the anode catalytic layer) to the <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> water formed at the cathode (i. e. in situ generation of dilute methanol at the anode layer). Crossover will be minimized without compromising the GFED by innovative integration of the anode flow-field and the diffusion layer.

40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) display powerful anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic activities. Serious {{side effects}} of NSAIDs, such as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and peptic ulcer disease, cause hospitalization and even death of many patients who take these drugs. This is thought to result from the ability of NSAIDs to induce a <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> luminal acids into GI tissues. NSAID-induced <b>back-diffusion</b> <b>of</b> luminal acids has both biochemical and biophysical aspects. The biochemical aspect of NSAID activity, i. e. the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase, has been examined extensively. However, the biophysical aspect of NSAID cyto-toxicity, i. e. the ability of NSAIDs to directly induce proton permeation across a phospholipid layer covering the GI tract, is not well understood. In order to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the cyto-toxicity of NSAIDs, the biophysical effect of NSAIDs on lipid membranes must be examined. The proton permeability of a phospholipid membrane depends on several factors: the packing of lipids, the membrane rigidity and deformability, the tendency for a membrane to form pores and the electrostatic properties of the membrane. We utilized a variety of experimental techniques, including micropipette aspiration of giant unilamellar vesicles, fluorescent spectroscopy and electrophoretic motility, to quantitatively characterize the effect of the sodium salt of salicylic acid, a classic anti-inflammatory agent, on mechanical and electrostatic properties of phospholipid membranes. We found that at near neutral pH, salicylate/salicylic acid decreases the bending stiffness of membranes composed of 1 -stearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (SOPC) and induces pore formation. As the solution pH was lowered to simulate the condition in the GI tract, the packing stability of SOPC vesicles exposed to sodium salicylate was seriously disrupted and the membrane dipole potential was decreased significantly. Salicylate anions also alter the membrane interfacial charge distribution by partitioning into the membrane. Thus, both salicylic acid and salicylate anion partition into membranes and affect membrane mesoscopic properties that determine membrane ion permeability. The ability of salicylate/salicylic acid to induce membrane pores suggests that this anti-inflammatory agent increases the probability of protons permeating across a phospholipid layer in the GI tract. The larger membrane damage caused by salicylate/salicylic acid at acidic pHs correlates well with clinical findings of higher toxicity of these drugs at low stomach pHs. It further confirms that the NSAID-lipid interaction is crucial the integrity of the mucosa. Moreover, since membranes are intimately involved in many important cell functions, effects of salicylate/salicylic acid on membranes observed in this thesis have relevance beyond the GI tract...|$|R
