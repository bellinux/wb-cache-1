50|$|The Roland SP-555 is a music sampler {{manufactured}} by Roland Corporation. It has 37 <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> {{that can be}} assigned to 16 pressure-sensitive pads.|$|R
50|$|EditDV {{was built}} on top of QuickTime and {{supported}} QuickTime filters {{as well as its}} own <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> and transitions. Effects could be animated using keyframes.|$|R
5000|$|Renoise {{includes}} many {{features such as}} an arranging tool called the [...] "pattern matrix", full cross-track modulation routing, <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> including a signal-follower metadevice that allows sidechain functionality, automatic softsynth-to-sample instrument rendering, and improved MIDI mapping.|$|R
5000|$|Guitar {{amplifier}} <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> {{were the}} first effects that musicians used regularly outside the studio. From the late 1940s onward, the Gibson Guitar Corp. began including vibrato circuits in combo amplifiers. The 1950 Ray Butts EchoSonic amp {{was the first to}} feature the [...] "slapback" [...] echo sound, which quickly became popular with guitarists such as Chet Atkins, Carl Perkins, Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, and Roy Orbison. By the 1950s, tremolo, vibrato and reverb were available as <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> on many guitar amplifiers. Both Premier and Gibson built tube-powered amps with spring reverb. Fender began manufacturing the tremolo amps Tremolux in 1955 and Vibrolux in 1956.|$|R
50|$|Viewers of {{the film}} wear {{polarized}} 3D glasses in order to experience the film's 3D effects. The 4-D effects are of two general types: in-theater special effects, such as water cannons, and specialized seating, with <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> and audio.|$|R
50|$|Since the 2000s, guitar {{amplifiers}} began having built-in multi-effects units or digital modeling effects. Bass amplifiers {{are less}} likely to have <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> although some may have a compressor/limiter or fuzz bass effect. Bass amps from the 1980s sometimes included built-in bass chorus.|$|R
50|$|Other Explorer-esque guitars {{include the}} ESP EX Dean Guitars' Z, Greco guitars' Explorer, Aria Pro II, Kramer's Condor, Peavey's Rotor series, Rondo Music's Douglas Halo and Agile Ghost, Gordon-Smith's Explorer, Chapman Guitars' Ghost Fret, and the Cort Effector, {{which is an}} Explorer version with <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> but no pickup toggle switch.|$|R
5000|$|JetAudio {{features}} {{a wide array}} of <b>built-in</b> sound <b>effects,</b> including: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, German company Steinberg {{released}} Cubase Audio on Atari Falcon 030. This version brought DSP <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> with 8-track {{audio recording}} & playback using only native hardware. The first Windows based software-only product, introduced in 1993, was Samplitude Studio (which already existed in 1992 as an audio {{editor for the}} Commodore Amiga).|$|R
50|$|Most {{models have}} {{controls}} {{based on the}} JC-120's standard setup. There are two channels, one clean, the other with <b>effects.</b> The <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> include stereo chorus, vibrato, reverb, and distortion. The amplifier features high and low inputs, a bright switch {{as well as a}} three band equalizer and volume for each channel.|$|R

5000|$|After the Pad-80, Roland {{continued}} to release SPD-8 with on-board sounds, as a standalone instrument in 1990, SPD-11 in 1993, {{which not only}} had more sounds but also <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> processing, and SPD-20 in 1998, which had more on-board sounds. These SPD Series products had not been named [...] "Octapad" [...] on the product panel.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Over the years, various Peavey bass {{amplifiers}} {{have had}} <b>built-in</b> distortion <b>effects.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2001 Kerzner {{teamed up}} with IK Multimedia to offer the sounds he created for {{keyboard}} workstations via computer software. Producing {{a majority of the}} sound range for the first comprehensive software rompler virtual instrument called [...] "SampleTank", Kerzner developed a plug-in for popular recording software that offers every type of sampled music instrument with <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> to be played via MIDI.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of DMCs is {{the abundance of}} control features that it provides for each input channel. The <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> of typical DMCs are robust and include gates, compressor limiters, equalizers, feedback controllers, and other signal processing hardware. One {{advantage of}} {{the large number of}} internal effects is that a DMC system is less vulnerable to failure and outside interference than a set-up using outboard hardware.|$|R
50|$|Samplitude Pro X2 Suite also {{includes}} a variety of high-quality <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> including the AM-munition Compressor/Limiter, the AM-Suite (Analogue Modeling Suite), and Vandal (Guitar and Bass Amp simulator). Samplitude {{also includes}} the essentialFX Suite, which are 10 plug-ins using high quality algorithms that have low resource demands. Samplitude Pro X2 Suite also includes the Independence Sampler Workstation that includes 70GB of content (Samplitude Pro X2 only 12GB).|$|R
5000|$|The Effect class, in [...]NET 3.5 SP1 and 4.0, {{ships with}} two <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> BlurEffect and DropShadowEffect. There are no direct {{replacements}} for OuterGlowBitmapEffect, EmbossBitmapEffect and BevelBitmapEffect, previously {{provided by the}} deprecated BitmapEffect class. However, {{there are other ways}} of achieving the same results with the Effect class. For example, developers can get an outer glow effect by using the DropShadowEffect with its ShadowDepth set to 0.|$|R
5000|$|Higher-cost bass {{amplifiers}} sometimes include <b>built-in</b> bass <b>effects,</b> {{which are}} electronic effects units designed for electric bass or more rarely, for upright bass. Common <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> include audio compressor or limiter features, which {{help to keep}} the amplifier from doing unwanted distorting at high volume levels and potentially damaging the speakers; equalizers; and in some amps from the 1980s and more commonly in the 2000s, bass overdrive. Bass amps may provide an XLR DI output for plugging the bass amp signal directly into a mixing board or PA system. Larger, more powerful bass amplifiers (300 or more watts) are often provided with internal or external metal heat sinks and/or fans {{to help keep the}} amplifier cool.|$|R

50|$|In 2005, Native Instruments added vinyl {{emulation}} {{capability to}} version 2.6 of Traktor DJ Studio. Version 2.6 included live input, streaming internet broadcasting, support for more file formats, and greatly expanded MIDI capability. Soon afterward, Traktor DJ Studio 3 added two more playback decks (for {{a total of}} four), <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> Beatport online store integration, a four-channel mixer, a Universal Binary version, deck caching, and minor improvements to existing features.|$|R
50|$|RPG Maker Series: Although {{technically}} far inferior, the OHR {{does offer}} many features that some versions of RPG Maker do not include. These include generally much less restrictive tiling and mapping, a side-view battle system, portraits, a built-in graphics editor, and a simpler, albeit less capable, scripting language. On the other hand, RPG Maker generally offers better story progression tools, higher color depth and resolution, {{and more complex}} <b>built-in</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
50|$|The unit {{also has}} a <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> unit with 31 {{different}} effects such as various types of reverb and delay. Most of the effects have configurable parameters. The unit is capable of only one effect at a time, shared both by the rhythm machine and the FM synthesis unit. The ratio of the processed and unprocessed sound in the output can be configured. The processing can also be toggled off for individual channels.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} a joint {{operation}} between the American and the Japanese branches of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Guitars were manufactured in Japan. Heartfield produced four models of guitars, each with various sub-model categories. The core models {{consisted of the}} RR, Elan, EX, and Talon. The RR series {{was one of the}} first to offer retro styling while the Talon was a more mass-produced line targeting metal and hard rock guitarists. Some of the models had active electronics, including <b>built-in</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

Producing {{a majority of the}} sound range for the first comprehensive software rompler virtual instrument called [...] "SampleTank", Kerzner developed a plug-in for popular recording software that offers every type of sampled music instrument with <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> to be played via MIDI. With IK Multimedia, Sonic Reality co-created virtual instruments such as Sonik Synth, Miroslav Philharmonik, SampleTron and SampleMoog.|$|R
50|$|In hip hop, a {{multi-track}} recorder {{is standard}} for recording. The Portastudio cassette recorder was {{the law in}} the in-house recording studios in the 1980s. Digital ADAT tape recorders became standard during the 1990s, but have been largely replaced by Digital Audio Workstations or DAWs such as Apple's Logic, Avid's Pro Tools and Steinberg's Nuendo and Cubase. DAW's allow for more intricate editing and unlimited track counts, as well as <b>built-in</b> <b>effects.</b> This allows producers to create music without the expense of a large commercial studio.|$|R
5000|$|More recently, Roland {{introduced}} the Groove Sampler concept. These devices are renowned for their ease of use, {{but a few}} lack the pitch transposition and keyzone mapping capabilities that most samplers have. Some have limits to rendering loops or sound effects samples that are played back at the same pitch they were recorded. Although these machines are equipped {{with a wide range}} of <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> a few lack pitch transposition and keyzone mapping that diminishes their utility significantly. The Roland Groove Sampler line includes the following: ...|$|R
50|$|Each channel {{displays}} a decibel meter and slots for optional third-party plugins. These plugins range from <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> to EQ, compression, and gates. These plugins {{can be implemented}} a number of ways. Each channel allows for plugins to be added via dropdown menus {{from a number of}} slots. Through this method, plugins are applied to individual channels. Alternatively, plugins can be applied to a number of channels by busing the desired channels to another track. In this case, the effectiveness of the effect can be controlled through the fader of the bused channel.|$|R
50|$|With the {{addition}} of sophisticated sequencers on board, now added to <b>built-in</b> <b>effects</b> and other features, the 'workstation' synthesizer had been born. These always include a multi-track sequencer, and can often record and playback samples, and in later years full audio tracks, {{to be used to}} record an entire song. These are usually also ROMplers, playing back samples, to give a wide variety of realistic instrument and other sounds such as drums, string instruments and wind instruments to sequence and compose songs, along with popular keyboard instrument sounds such as electric pianos and organs.|$|R
5000|$|Users can compose in PROGRESSION both in {{standard}} notation and tablature ("TAB") {{at the same}} time and hear their musical ideas played back with digital samples from Victor Wooten (bass), Roy [...] "Futureman" [...] Wooten (drums), Neil Zaza (guitar), and others. Playback features include <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> amp simulators, customizable bends and slides, and continuous real-time control of playback tempos. With its MIDI Out features, a user can incorporate sounds from other sound libraries outside of PROGRESSION. Target users include beginning guitarists, emerging composers, music students, and home hobbyists.|$|R
5000|$|Bass {{effects are}} {{electronic}} effects units {{that are designed}} for use with an electric bass and a bass amplifier, or for an upright bass and a bass amp or PA system. Bass effects are commonly available in stompbox-style pedals, which are metal or plastic boxes with a foot-operated pedal switch or button which turns the effect on and off. Most pedals also have knobs to control the tone, volume and effect level. Some bass effects are available in 19" [...] rackmount units, which can be mounted in a road case. As well, some bass amplifiers have <b>built-in</b> <b>effects,</b> such as overdrive or chorus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Built-in</b> special <b>effects</b> include full lens flares, water ripples, {{particle}} systems, real-time shadows, 3D {{video projection}} (in MPEG or AVI format), 3D positioned sound, and post-production effects (such as 'sepia', 'bloom' and 'corona').|$|R
