There was {{no effect on the}} number of colonies of rosy leaf curling aphid (Dysaphis devecta), nor on the fruit damage caused by common earwig (Forficula auricularia) and apple sawfly on cv. G.

The level of infestation of rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea), leaf miner moths (Phyllonorycter blancardella, Lyonetia clerkella), and agromyzid flies (Phytomyza heringiana) increased in the kaolin-treated plots. Kaolin treatments promoted woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) infestation, which became severe, while it reduced the abundance of polyphagous predators like F. auricularia, predaceous Heteroptera and Coleoptera, the red velvet mite (Allothrombium fuliginosum), spiders (Araneae) and the abundance of common black ant (Lasius niger). The treatments also reduced parasitism of the apple sawfly by the ichneumonid Lathrolestes ensator. Many weeks after ending the kaolin treatments, the number of predaceous Coleoptera and especially the number of spiders remained low in the kaolin-treated plots...|$|E
25|$|Adult weevils create brown, rice-sized feeding pits. They chew {{through the}} leaf epidermis, and if {{prolonged}} feeding continues can create small {{holes in the}} leaves.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult clover <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils,</b> Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult clover <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils</b> potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, author {{collective}} {{present results}} and methodology of the insecticides testing against maize <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil,</b> in laboratory conditions. Year by year at NARDI Fundulea, in field conditions, it has tested insecticides used both like seed and vegetation treatment for controlling of the maize <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil.</b> Because climatic conditions {{from the spring}} are not favorable for this pest every year, laboratory testing {{is one of the}} best methods for evaluate of the insecticides used like seed treatment. At eight days after insects are added in the pots with maize plants, highest adults mortality and lowest attack intensity has registered in case of plants emerged from the seeds treated with products on base of thiametoxan (Cruiser 350 FS), clothianidin (Poncho 600 FS) or thiametoxan+teflutrin (Force Zea). In case of seeds treated with product on base of imidacloprid (Nuprid 600 FS 8, 0 l/t), even if the insects mortality was lower, the attack intensity has low values. All plants from the untreated variant were destroyed. At treated variants, saved plants percent were at least 90 %.

40|$|The clover <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hypera punctata F.) is a {{sporadic}} {{but potentially}} serious pest of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Feeding of newly emerged adult fourth instar clover <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> was simulated {{in a field}} study at the University of Nebraska Haskell Agricultural Research Lab near Concord, Nebraska, in May 2001 and 2002. Twelve 1 - by 1 -m plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three treatments and four replications. Treatments consisted of two levels of simulated clover <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> defoliation of alfalfa and an undefoliated check. Leaflets were removed over 10 d. Dry matter yield and other plant responses were measured {{during the first two}} growth cycles. Yield differences among all three treatments were significant for the first growth cycle. The relationship be-tween percentage defoliation and percentage yield reduction was linear both years. Defoliation did not significantly affect percentages of acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and protein. Alfalfa development also was not significantly affected in the second growth cycle. Dry matter yield reduction as a result of leaf removal at the early bud stage was the most important effect of first growth cycle defoliation...|$|R
40|$|The pea <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> {{is one of}} the few {{insect pests}} of field peas in {{southern}} Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan. Adults cause distinctive notching on seedlings which generally does not affect yield. Larval feeding on nitrogen-fixing root nodules may reduce yield if soil is nitrogen deficient. Only field peas and faba beans are at risk of damage. Other crops in the bean family may be fed on by adults but do not suffer significant damage from larvae. The economic threshold during the second to fifth node stages in field peas is 30 % of seedlings with damage to the terminal (clam) leaf. Seed treated with thiamethoxam has produced more consistent yield responses than application of foliar insecticides but additional farm-level trials are required. Trap cropping the pea <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> can be done by planting a border in the fall with winter peas or adjacent, earlier planting of a spring cultivar. Close monitoring of the trap crop is needed to control the weevils in the trap crop area before they move to the rest of the field. Fields under no tillage regimes suffer less damage than those under conventional tillage. Biological control is a research area that should be pursued for sustainable management of this pest. Background The pea <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitona lineatus L. (Fig. 1), belongs to the most speciose insect order, the Coleoptera, and the most speciose beetle family, the Curculionidae.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the effect of aqueous extracts from fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) seeds at 2 %, 5 %, 10 % and 20 % concentrations on the feeding of peal <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitona lineatus L.) on broad bean (Vicia faba L.). The experiment was conducted in the laboratory, in six replicates. Feeding intensity assessment was conducted by dipping leaves of broad bean in respective solutions of the extracts and determining the area of broad bean leaves, eaten by pea <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> beetle in the 12 hour intervals. In addition, absolute deterrence index and palatability index were calculated. As a result of the observation no significant limiting effect of fennel seed aqueous extracts on the feeding of the pea <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> females was shown. All of the used fennel extracts had inhibitory effect on the feeding of male S. linetaus and the strongest effect of extracts was observed in the first 36 hours of the experiment. The high values of the palatability index (particularly for the females) with relatively low absolute deterrence index, indicate limited possibilities of the use of aqueous extracts from fennel seeds for the protection against the feeding of the beetles from the genus Sitona...|$|R
