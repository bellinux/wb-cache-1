40|$|Juvenile {{delinquency}} is a noteworthy problem. This thesis {{addressed the}} association <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> juvenile delinquency {{by analyzing the}} concepts of parenting adopted in family research in relation to criminological concepts and measures of delinquent behavior. Four studies were conducted. The first study addressed a meta-analysis on <b>parenting</b> characteristics <b>and</b> styles in relation to delinquency. In this meta-analysis, previous manuscripts were systematically analyzed, computing mean effect sizes for each <b>parenting</b> dimension <b>and</b> investigating the influence of moderators. Concurrent and longitudinal studies analyzing the link <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> delinquency were examined. Furthermore, the meta-analysis examined whether {{the sex of the}} child moderates the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> delinquency. The second study investigated the long-term associations <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> delinquency. This study focused on <b>parenting</b> characteristics <b>and</b> styles in early adolescence in relation to delinquency in young adulthood, covering a period of about 10 years. In this chapter, we used datasets from the two longitudinal studies, the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) and the Child-Rearing and Family in the Netherlands Study (CFNS). The third study focused on links <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> different trajectories of delinquents. Several delinquency trajectories were identified based on self-reported and official delinquency data collected in the PYS during adolescence on the youngest cohort. Furthermore, the links <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> these different types of delinquents were investigated. In the fourth study, using a subsample from the CFNS of 330 intact families, the relationship <b>between</b> fathers' <b>and</b> mothers' <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> delinquency in adolescence and young adulthood was addressed. Both concurrent links as well as longitudinal links <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> styles <b>and</b> delinquency were investigated. Separate analyses on fathers' <b>and</b> mothers' <b>parenting</b> as well as combinations of parenting styles of fathers and mothers were studied in relation to delinquency. In addition, sex-differences in the parenting-delinquency link were studied by analyzing interaction-effects <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> sex on delinquency...|$|R

25|$|Presence of {{long-lasting}} bonds <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> young seen in {{the family}} of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring. An unusual interaction observed <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> young were the embrace by adult males and the bridge formation. Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in bridge formation. The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing {{is a way for}} the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E

40|$|Adolescent {{aggressive}} behavior {{is a major}} social problem in the United States and is linked to violence and violence-related injury. Understanding the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> early adolescent aggression provides important insights for developing prevention interventions. This study explored the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> early adolescent aggression in an urban low-income, predominately African American sample.

40|$|Child maltreatment is a {{critical}} public health problem with risk factors that directly hinder the quality of interactions <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child.

This study examined the quality of 12 parenting behaviors during interactive play <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child and their association to the potential of child maltreatment with the interactive effect of demographic variables. It was hypothesized that poor interactive <b>parenting</b> behaviors <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child would be associated with higher maltreatment potential. Participants were 99 high-risk families drawn from the first cohort of an ongoing cluster randomized research trial. The 12 <b>parenting</b> behaviors <b>and</b> their interaction with family demographic characteristics were not predictive of the potential for child maltreatment among participant families. Although, the proposed hypothesis was not supported, the findings suggest the need for further investigation of other familial factors influencing maltreatment potential among participant families...|$|R
25|$|Liability for {{omissions}} {{has long}} existed where a pre-existing duty {{can be established}} between two parties.

A special duty also exists <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> their children, and an omission of a parent to save their young child from drowning would result in criminal liability, as it is deemed a parent voluntarily undertakes to ensure the wellbeing of their child. Other duties may be inferred from contractual obligations, and so an individual employed to ensure individuals do not cross a railway line while there are trains running would be found criminally negligent where he abandoned his post.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts between animals {{occur in}} many contexts, such as between {{potential}} mating partners, <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> offspring, between siblings and between competitors for resources. Group-living animals may {{dispute over the}} direction of travel or the allocation of time to joint activities. Various factors limit the escalation of aggression, including communicative displays, conventions, and routines. In addition, following aggressive incidents, various forms of conflict resolution have been observed in mammalian species, particularly in gregarious primates. These can mitigate or repair possible adverse consequences, especially for the recipient of aggression who may become vulnerable to attacks by other members of a group. Conciliatory acts vary by species and may involve specific gestures or simply more proximity and interaction between the individuals involved. However, conflicts over food are rarely followed by post conflict reunions, {{even though they are}} the most frequent type in foraging primates.|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{parents can}} reply that their love, however intense, is pure, and has {{absolutely}} no sensual element. Maybe--and maybe not. But admit that it is so. It does not help. The intense excitement of the upper centers of sympathy willy-nilly arouses the lower centers. It arouses them to activity, even if it denies them any expression or any polarized connection. Our psyche is so framed that activity aroused on one plane provokes activity on the corresponding plane, automatically. So the intense pure love-relation <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child inevitably arouses the lower centers in the child, the centers of sex. Now the deeper sensual centers, once aroused, should find response from the sensual body of some other, some friend or lover. The response is impossible <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child. Myself, I believe that biologically there is radical sex-aversion <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child, at the deeper sensual centers. The sensual circuit cannot adjust itself spontaneously between the two.|$|R
25|$|During {{the period}} of the stolen generations, Aboriginal {{children}} were removed from their families and placed in institutions where they were punished for speaking their indigenous language. Different, mutually unintelligible language groups were often were mixed together, with Australian Aboriginal English or Australian Kriol language as the only lingua franca. The result was a disruption to the inter-generational transmission of these languages that severely impacted their future use. Today, that same transmission of language <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> grandparents to their children is a key mechanism for reversing language shift. For children, proficiency in the language of their cultural heritage has a positive influence on their ethnic identity formation, and it is thought to be of particular benefit to the emotional well-being of Indigenous children. There is some evidence to suggest that the reversal of the Indigenous language shift may lead to decreased self-harm and suicide rates among Indigenous youth.|$|E
25|$|Although cheek kissing is not {{as widely}} practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as {{in other parts of}} Europe, it is still commonplace.

Cheek kissing is acceptable <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part.

25|$|All human {{societies}} organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> children (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities {{and expectations of}} solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship {{is the ability to}} form descent groups, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as clans. Another function {{is the way in which}} kinship unites families through marriage, forming kinship alliances between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited—such rules vary widely between cultures. Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either cross or parallel cousins. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of kinship terminology in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity (nurture kinship).|$|E
