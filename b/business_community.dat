5|$|During the 1800s, Nadars, then an {{aspiring}} <b>business</b> <b>community,</b> established their commercial {{base in the}} town. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, the Nadars’ rapid rise as a <b>business</b> <b>community</b> and pursuit for higher social status caused resentment in higher castes. The mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1899, leading to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and the Big Chariot {{in the center of the}} city (used by the temple during festivals) were burnt during the riots. Eventually the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899.|$|E

Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the <b>business</b> <b>community.</b> Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general <b>business</b> <b>community</b> regarding management issues.|$|E
