40|$|In the United States, total small <b>business</b> <b>outstanding</b> loans {{declined}} by 2. 5 % in 2013, {{compared to a}} 10. 4 % increase in 2012. Scholars and business practitioners have indicated that small business entrepreneurs experience constraints in accessing capital to grow their businesses. Many small firm owners lack the financial strategies for gaining access to capital to sustain their businesses. Building on system functionality theory, {{the purpose of this}} exploratory multiple case study was to explore the financial strategies among 3 purposefully-selected small business owners in Washington DC metro area who successfully overcame the financial constraints. Six themes emerged from the thematic analysis of interview data: credit cards, family and friends, own financing, bank financing, crowdfunding, and government grants and loans. These small firm owners preferred to use their own financing or to borrow from family and friends rather than lending from the banks because of borrowing constraints. Some of the lending limitations included high-interest rates, lack of collateral, provision of a robust business plan, and availability of good financial records. The findings from this study may contribute to social change by providing business owners with more knowledge on financial strategies to use in accessing capital to sustain their businesses. With the improvement in business profitability, business owners will contribute to the economic growth of the local community through the provision of employment opportunities and social amenities...|$|E
