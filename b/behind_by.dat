5|$|Extreme Rising (formerly Extreme Reunion) was an American {{independent}} professional wrestling promotion {{founded in}} 2012. Meant {{to fill the}} void of hardcore wrestling left <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Extreme Rising assembled a roster of ECW alumni, but later expanded to include younger talent. The promotion closed after cancelling all future shows on April 22, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The radiometric age of Lake Tauca {{ranges from}} 72,600 to 7200 BP. The {{duration}} of the lake highstands may be overestimated due to radiation scatter. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on crusts containing calcite, gastropod shells, stromatolites and structures left <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> algae. The Lake Tauca shorelines formed over more than century-long periods.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt met Virginia for {{the first}} time since 1898. It also won {{for the first}} time, 13–0. Ammie Sikes scored first, after runs of 35 and 28 yards by Lew Hardage paved the way. A 30-yard forward pass from Hardage to Enoch Brown got the second touchdown. In the last period, Sikes broke loose, down to the 5-yard line when he was caught from <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> Buck Mayer.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} from earlier games in the franchise - both members of the Third Street Saints and former adversaries - make a return in Saints Row IV, many of whom take up the protagonist's Presidential administration. Kinzie Kensington, the socially awkward FBI hacker from Saints Row: The Third becomes the White House's press secretary, often tasked with clearing up the mess left <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> the President's verbal missteps. Benjamin King, former leader of the Vice Kings gang from the original Saints Row, becomes the President's Chief of Staff, while Pierce Washington has been appointed the Communications Director and Shaundi as the Director of the Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E

Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E
5|$|By February17, 80percent of {{the grid}} was restored; however, only 10percent homes were {{actually}} connected. The presence of dead vegetation left <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> the storm created fire hazards across the island, prompting the government to issue a ban on burning. The Seventh Day Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February15 despite losing a building. All other schools suspended activities until February22; however, the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day. On February23, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands. Habitat for Humanity later sought {{to assist in the}} rebuilding process in April, with a funding goal of NZ$300,000 (US$210,000).|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was struggling in conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E

5|$|During the November 11, 2006, {{game against}} Kansas State, McCoy {{suffered}} a stinger shoulder injury while rushing {{for a touchdown}} on the opening drive against Kansas State. Snead came in and played {{the remainder of the}} game. The Longhorns fell <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> as much as 21 points before Snead brought them back to within 3, finally falling in an upset by the Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared to play the game against the Aggies.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught <b>behind</b> <b>by</b> Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E
