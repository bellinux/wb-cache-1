[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
2500|$|In 1725, {{the painter}} Alessandro Marchesini, {{who was also}} the buyer for the Lucchese art {{collector}} Stefano Conti, had inquired about buying two more 'views of Venice', when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of [...] "Antonio Canale... it is like Carlevaris, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the sun shining in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Louth player J. P. Rooney said: [...] "Aaron Hoey was {{pleading}} with [...] {{to consult with}} his umpires but when he went in, he told them {{to put up the}} green flag. [...] I know it's wrong, people running at the ref, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> why Louth people did it. He brought it on himself and I wouldn't feel sorry for him".|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} service {{uniform of the}} Royal Moroccan Army is olive drab, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also <b>see</b> Moroccan troops {{with other types of}} uniforms such as the Desert lizard, Red Lizard and Camouflage Centre Europe uniforms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Without doubt, yes. I {{never saw}} him, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>see</b> the {{resemblance}} to his father," [...] said Sellers, {{holding up the}} chromo and glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and back again with an approving eye.|$|R
2500|$|Lowell stated, [...] "The poets {{who most}} {{directly}} influenced me ... were Allen Tate, Elizabeth Bishop, and William Carlos Williams. An unlikely combination! ... <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that Bishop {{is a sort}} of bridge between Tate's formalism and Williams's informal art." [...] Lowell was capable of writing both formal, metered verse as well as free verse; his verse in some poems from Life Studies and Notebook fell somewhere in between metered and free verse.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} series of The F Word, Ramsay showed a {{softened}} stance on vegetarianism after learning about intensive pig farming practices including castration and tail docking. On the programme, Ramsay commented, [...] "It's {{enough to make}} anyone turn fucking vegetarian, for God's sake. And I've always sort of knocked vegetarians and vegans for missing out on the most amazing flavour you can get from meat. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{why so many people}} change instantly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{viewed the}} {{betrayal}} as a relief and release for {{herself as an}} actor, and as a [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "open" [...] moment for Lexa. [...] "It's the first real time you get to see—apart from —this is a scene where she makes a really strong choice, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that it's {{hard for her to}} do, and she does care," [...] Debnam-Carey stated. She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt [...] " [...] always knew [...] was going to [...] Now those cards are back on the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else." ...|$|E
50|$|It's {{cleaned up}} and {{repaired}} now, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> the evidence of that day. Houses still bear the mark of Irene and that {{of people trying to}} fix the problems. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> where the river eroded the edges of the road and banks, underneath the patches that were put there.|$|R
50|$|Mote Hill is {{also known}} as Heiding Hill or Murdoch's Knowe and is the {{location}} of the Beheading Stone, the traditional execution block of medieval Stirling. The stone itself is now on a concrete mount and under an iron cage, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> the axe marks from the executions.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, lady. If it {{had been}} a simple {{fracture}} his leg might be bandaged up so that it would heal in time, <b>but,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> for yourself, the bone is all splintered and broken, and unless something is done mortification will set in, and in a few days he will cease to live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say," [...] {{interrupted}} her husband, [...] "that he thinks he's entirely sincere in asking my advice. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how {{he wishes to}} be advised." ...|$|E
60|$|Harper {{shook his}} head. “It’s {{not easy to}} make a boat out until you’re close up with her, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> a steamer quite a long way off,” he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Devil take it! And in this place, too, in {{the public}} street, so to speak. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{yourself}} how it is. One of his fantastic sallies. Absolutely of no consequence." ...|$|E
50|$|The usual rule is {{that you}} are allowed to look through all the tiles in the discard stacks to your right (the tiles you discarded) and to your left (the tiles you had an {{opportunity}} to take), <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only <b>see</b> the exposed top tiles of the two discard stacks {{on the other side of}} the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Both you {{and your}} {{daughter}} could only have interpreted any such action on my part as instigated by self-interest, for you both knew that I wanted to make her my wife," [...] replied the other. [...] "My hands were tied. I am sorry now that I did not act, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> readily <b>see</b> the position in which I was placed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} so; {{it is out}} of the question, indeed. <b>But</b> of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the doings full well, such as they are to be, {{like the rest of the}} spectators." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs Bhaer is {{not visible}} today--out just now, I believe; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{the house and}} grounds if you like,' he murmured, falling back as the four pressed in gazing rapturously about them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought the}} job was mine, sir. I was the company's servant, and the captain was injured. If I'd told my story {{at the office and}} the Commandancia---- <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the obstacles!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> for yourself. I can't {{stay here}} alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my sight would go--I know it would." ...|$|E
50|$|Today the {{platform}} remains {{along with two}} structures (see the picture of this article). The main building is very overgrown <b>but</b> <b>you</b> walk along the tree covered platform and enter via the middle door. Inside are some faded signs {{on the door and}} some men's urinals at the far end. The whole area is very over grown <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> the station very clearly.|$|R

6000|$|Louisa {{asked if}} she might invite her Cousin Mary to go too. [...] "Yes," [...] said her mother; [...] "I think she is not at home; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go and <b>see,</b> if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me finish, sir," [...] Gerald begged hoarsely. [...] "The note must be met. If I {{take it up}} on presentation, {{the matter}} ends there; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the {{consequences}} if it's dishonored." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll row you round there. Can't land, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{the place}} and shout to the others, if that will be any comfort to you," [...] {{proposed}} Frank, as they pulled away round the pier.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{came for}} you yesterday, Arnold," [...] he said. [...] "I haven't opened it, of course, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> from the {{name at the}} back of the {{envelope}} that it is from a firm of solicitors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! it is splendid!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, {{laughing}} in a subdued voice. [...] "It's so awfully absurd looking, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> for I don't see {{a bit of}} your face." ...|$|R
60|$|No. There's <b>but</b> {{one thing}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> here, which <b>you</b> didn't in Ghirlandajo's fresco, {{unless you were}} very clever and looked hard for it--the Baby! And you are never likely to see a more true piece of Giotto's work in this world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her {{hair and}} eyes are dark, but her neck and arms are white as snow. No mortal <b>can</b> ever <b>see</b> how fair she is. She is fleeter than a deer, and that mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> hear her calling at night; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear her {{laughing}} under the stars. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never <b>see</b> her.

6000|$|... "Well, not exactly. It's {{up a bit}} on a side road. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the buildings--very nice, too--although not so big {{as those}} up to Brill. I'll point 'em out to you when we get there." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{broke out}} laughing. [...] "Well, perhaps you've {{suffered}} enough. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> now, can't you, {{that it would}} have been awful if I had met him, and let out that I didn't know he was here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we did,--if {{you want}} me to say it. And I'm not accusing you of anything. I know you acted for the best. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> yourself, can't you, that it was rather sudden to have it end so quickly--" ...|$|E
6000|$|You see, reader, how polite they were, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> neither <b>see</b> nor {{conceive}} {{how great}} was the effort made by each {{to conceal the}} tumult that agitated the breast and flushed the countenance, while the tongue was thus ably controlled. It did not last long, however. Oliver, being thrown off his guard, asked a number of confused questions, and Rose, in her somewhat irrelevant replies, happened to make some reference to [...] "that villain Clearemout." ...|$|R
50|$|The dam/weir {{was built}} to guide water to a channel,that fed a water wheel in the Corn Mill,(there is a sluice gate where the dam meets the channel, this turns the wheel on and off) this gave power to grind the various {{products}} (Wheat, Barley etc.). The power to the Mill was all belt driven through a pulley system.

All I need now is to kill that reporter. He has smashed my world, sure thing, and I may find my poor little mother crushed under it, too."
