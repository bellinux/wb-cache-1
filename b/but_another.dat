In one surviving charter of 788 Hygeberht is listed with the title of bishop, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> from late 788 gives him the title of archbishop. More charters from 789 and 792 also give him the title of archbishop, and he continued to be named as such on charters until 799.|$|E

5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E

5|$|According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was {{approached}} by West and almost signed a deal with him, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.|$|E
5|$|Around 1849 Wilkes went to California, {{either with}} or {{shortly after his}} friend David Colbreth Broderick. Wilkes was a {{political}} advisor of Broderick's, but they quarreled over water issues in 1853 and Wilkes left California. Wilkes then traveled to Europe, turning the experience into another book, this one entitled Europe in a Hurry. Returning to California after Europe, he reunited with Broderick in late 1853 <b>but</b> <b>another</b> quarrel in 1854 over Wilkes' appointment to a judicial post led to Wilkes' leaving California permanently. The two men reconciled in 1859 during a visit by Broderick to New York shortly before Broderick's death. Wilkes was the recipient of Broderick's estate, and Wilkes wrote a long eulogy to his friend {{that appeared in the}} Spirit in October 1859.|$|E

5|$|Australia's two {{new leaders}} {{featured}} in a dramatic game during the season—the first tied match in Sheffield Shield history, played at the Junction Oval in Melbourne. New South Wales, chasing 161 to win, slumped to 7/70 when Craig (suffering tonsillitis) defied medical orders, left his hospital bed, and came out to bat. A partnership of 75 with Richie Benaud took them to within 16 runs of victory, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> collapse left the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all <b>but</b> <b>another</b> type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E

The draw meant that the series was at 1–1 heading into the final Test at The Oval, which would be timeless.|$|E
5|$|In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also {{ended the}} dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up any claim to {{control of the}} abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, {{as part of their}} attempt to annexe Glastonbury to their bishopric, had been known as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury. They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part of the settlement, a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury. The papacy had never {{acknowledged}} Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot. The historian J. A. Robinson felt that as part of the settlement, Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> historian, David Knowles, disagreed.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, when Ernest was six, Henry Shackleton gave up {{his life}} as a {{landowner}} to study medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, moving his family into the city. Four years later, the family moved again, from Ireland to Sydenham in suburban London. Partly this was in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> factor may have been unease about their Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the assassination by Irish nationalists of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the British Secretary for Ireland, in 1882.|$|E

5|$|Matters were {{complicated}} by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, {{reduced the number}} of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play The Miser, which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. The Miser was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> of his plays, Deborah: or, a Wife for You All, lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's The Opera of Operas, Fielding's Tom Thumb set to music.|$|E

Robert became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Nicholas a baron of the Exchequer. Ralph Neville was also related to Hugh de Neville, King John of England's chief forester.|$|E

Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 {{kilograms}} of Ecstasy in 2002. According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the scene when Atias was shot, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> man had pulled the trigger.

5|$|Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189, {{within days}} of taking the throne; the formal {{election}} took place on 10 August. What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, {{as well as the}} exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, <b>but</b> <b>another</b> chronicler, Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place until much later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, as archbishop.|$|E
