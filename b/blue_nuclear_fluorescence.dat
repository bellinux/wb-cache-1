Treatment of the cells with DNase destroyed the ability of the nucleus to react with antiuridine fluorescent antibodies. 4. Fluoresceinated anti-BSA did not produce <b>nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence</b> occurred only in cells harvested during the period of maximum DNA synthesis as measured by the uptake of thymidine.

In African green monkey kidney cell cultures (AGMK) infected with SV 40 virus, viral antigen appeared in the nucleus at 18 hours and reached a peak at 38 hours, after which nuclear antigen decreased and a cytoplasmic stage occurred (1). <b>Nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence</b> was also observed 10 days after infection of cells of grivet monkey kidney, rhesus monkey kidney, human embryo kidney, and Syrian hamster kidney (2). The same techniques were applied to cells transformed by SV 40 virus in a search for evidence of viral antigen.

In cultures of transformed human embryo kidney cells, which were producing virus, less than 0. 1 per cent of cells showed <b>nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence</b> (3) and it seems probable that these were the cells responsible for virus replication. It has recently been demonstrated that SV 40 tumors and transformed cells contain a specific complement-fixing (CF) antigen, distinct from that of the virus particle, which reacts with sera of hamsters bearing SV 40 tumors (4). Based on this information, an indirect immunofluorescent test for SV 40 -transformed cells was developed using the serum of hamsters beating SV 40 tumors. It was hoped that such a technique would prove effective in detection of transformed cells and that information would be gained on the location of the antigen and the percentage of cells elaborating antigen...|$|R

40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) UL 35 open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 12 -kDa capsid protein {{designated}} VP 26. VP 26 {{is located on the}} outer surface of the capsid specifically on the tips of the hexons that constitute the capsid shell. The bioluminescent jellyfish (Aequorea victoria) green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused in frame with the UL 35 ORF to generate a VP 26 -GFP fusion protein. This fusion protein was fluorescent and localized to distinct regions within the nuclei of transfected cells following infection with wild-type virus. The VP 26 -GFP marker was introduced into the HSV- 1 (KOS) genome resulting in recombinant plaques that were fluorescent. A virus, designated K 26 GFP, was isolated and purified and was shown to grow as well as the wild-type virus in cell culture. An analysis of the intranuclear capsids formed in K 26 GFP-infected cells revealed that the fusion protein was incorporated into A, B, and C capsids. Furthermore, the fusion protein incorporated into the virion particle was fluorescent as judged by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of infected cells in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. Cells infected with K 26 GFP exhibited a punctate <b>nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence</b> at early times in the replication cycle.

40|$|A {{series of}} mutants of simian virus 40 has been {{constructed}} with deletions in the coding sequence for large T antigen. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that 4 mutants have in-phase and 11 have out-of-phase deletions.

40|$|Fluorescence imaging {{of cells}} is a {{powerful}} tool for exploring the dynamics of organelles, proteins, and viruses. Fluorescent adenoviruses are a model system for cargo transport from the cell surface to the nucleus. Here, we describe a procedure to quantitate adenovirus-associated fluorescence in different subcellular regions. CCD camera-captured fluorescence sections across entire cells were deblurred by a fast Fourier transformation, the background was subtracted images merged, and virus fluorescence quantitated. The validity of the deblurring routine was verified by confocal laser scanning microscopy, demonstrating that objects were neither generated nor deleted. Instead, the homogeneity of both the average intensity and the size of fluorescent particles was increased, facilitating automated quantification. We found that <b>nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence</b> of wt adenovirus, but not of a virus mutant ts 1, which fails to escape from endosomes, was maximal at 90 min postinfection (p. i.).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} measurement of <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> gamma-rays as a technique to non-destructively determine isotopic compositions of target materials that are of interest for nuclear security applications. The physical processes that can result in non-resonant background to <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> measurements are described and investigated using a radiation transport computer code that relies on the Monte Carlo technique, MCNPX. The phenomenon of <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> is discussed with consideration of the angular distributions of resonance emissions, the effects of nuclear recoil, {{and the influence of}} thermal motion. Models describing two ways of measuring <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> rates in materials are considered. First {{the measurement of}} back-scattered photons is considered. In this type of measurement, the portion of the interrogating photon beam that is scattered into large relative angles is measured. When the radioactivity of the target can be overcome by shielding or by use of intense photon sources, direct measurement of gamma-rays, emitted during <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> can provide quantitative signatures that appear to be useful for applications such as forensic age-dating of large radiological sources. However, if the target radioactivity is too intense, as in the case for most spent nuclear fuel, a second measurement type, where indirect measurement of transmitted resonant-energy photons can also provide quantitative information. This method allows radiation detectors to be better-shielded from target radioactivity, but suffers from a slower accrual rate of statistical confidence. The models described herein indicate that very intense photon sources and large high-resolution detector arrays would be needed to measure 239 Pu content in spent fuel to precisions desired by nuclear safeguards organizations. However, the rates at which statistics accrue are strongly proportional to the strengths of the resonances, and measurement of a plutonium isotope with stronger resonances may provide more practical measurement rates. The model for predicting relative detection rates of <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> gamma-rays in the transmission measurement was experimentally tested using the 238 U in a mixture of depleted uranium and lead as a surrogate for 239 Pu in spent fuel. The experiment indicated that the model was approximately correct, but that the process of notch refilling, which was excluded from the initial model, appears to be visible. Data files of the computer code, MCNPX, were modified to allow for <b>nuclear</b> resonance <b>fluorescence</b> to be simulated and a bug in the code was repaired to allow the code to more accurately simulate non-resonant elastic photon scattering. Simulations using this modified version of MCNPX have indicated that the magnitude of the notch refill process is comparable to that of the difference between the analytical model and the experimental data...|$|R

Here we have identified two novel nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs in murine Nrf 2, one located near the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 42 – 53) and the other (residues 587 – 593) located near the C-terminal region. Imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged Nrf 2 revealed that mutation(s) {{in any of these}} sequences resulted in decreased <b>nuclear</b> <b>fluorescence</b> intensity compared with the wild-type Nrf 2 when Nrf 2 activation was induced with the electrophile tert-butylhydroquinone. The mutations also impaired Nrf 2 -induced transactivation of antioxidant response element-driven reporter gene expression to the same extent as the Nrf 2 construct bearing mutation in a previously identified bipartite NLS that maps at residues 494 – 511. When linked to GFP or to GFP-PEPCK-C each of the novel NLS motifs was sufficient to drive nuclear translocation of the fusion proteins.
