40|$|Abstract- This paper reviews {{numerical}} {{methods and}} analysis procedures {{used in the}} study of automotive disc <b>brake.</b> It <b>covers</b> Finite element Method approaches in the automotive industry, the complex Contact analysis. The advantages and limitations of each approach will examine. This review can help analysts to choose right methods and make decisions on new areas of method development. The complex eigen value method is choose for contact analysis of car disc brake. The essence of such a method lies in the asymmetric stiffness matrix derived from the contact stiffness and the friction coefficient at the disc interfaces. This paper presents the analysis of the contact pressure distributions at the disc interfaces using a detailed 3 -dimensional finite element model of a real car disc brake. It is also investigates different levels in modelling a disc brake system and simulating contact pressure distributions at varying load. It points out some outstanding issues in modeling and analysis of disc brake squeal and proposes new research topics. Wear can take place when two or more bodies in frictional contact slide against each other. It is found that the complex Contact analysis is still the approach favored by the automotive industry...|$|R

The running gear of the gondola car consists of 2 two-axle bogies of model 18-7020, which are equipped with elastic-rolling runner skids of a new system. In order to improve traffic safety the gondola is equipped with a new system of separate braking carts.

40|$|Brake squeal is a {{major problem}} for the vehicle {{industry}} due to recla-mations and quality perception of vehicles, as well as the unpredictability of its occurrence. This report investigates the physical reasons behind a multi-tonal brake squeal generated in a motorcycle disc <b>brake.</b> It also <b>covers</b> why previous remedies to eliminate the noise has had an e↵ect, as well as trying to ﬁnd a stable cost-e↵ective solution to the problem. The brake components are studied using numerical simulations as well as experimental analysis, the accuracy of which is investigated by analyzing a simple beam and compar-ing the results to analytical calculations. By performing a FEM-simulation of the di↵erent subsystems, the multi-tonal sound was tracked down to the ABS tone wheel, e. a. the sensory ring that is used for wheel speed mea-surements. By simulating the modes with altered tone wheel thickness, the modal pattern remains the same albeit reduced in frequency. A character-istic dimension between the tone wheels mounting points where found, as the frequency where these bending modes between the mounting points oc-curred closely correlated with the frequency content of the measured noise. A thinner tone wheel was then manufactured and ﬁeld tested, these test results shows a reduction in frequency for the multi-tonal sound, thus the indications from the simulation is conﬁrmed. Furthermore, an investigation in to brake disc properties is carried out in order to explain the reason why discs with altered geometry lacks the squealing problems of the original disc. This is done by a simulation of the sound propagation eﬃciency of the discs out-of-plane surfaces as well as an experimental study of the insertion loss from the friction surface between the brake disc and the brake pads to the tone wheel. The report ends with suggestions of design changes that can help combat the current issues, as well as problems of the same nature that might arise in future brake design...|$|R
5000|$|In the USA, an {{emergency}} stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running {{within the body}} of a railway car would have been what was known as the [...] "communicating cord." [...] This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the [...] "engineer"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a [...] "normal stop" [...] or an [...] "emergency application," [...] at his discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make {{an emergency}} stop. Emergency brake valves were (and still are) always located on the bulkheads (end walls), inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The emergency <b>brake</b> valve is <b>covered</b> by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled [...] "Emergency Only." [...] Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled [...] "signal." [...] Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an emergency brake valve is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately from those of the cars, is evacuated ("dumped" [...] in US jargon), immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a [...] "separation"). No action is required (or even possible) {{on the part of the}} engineer. The train will stop, no matter what he/she does. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the emergency valve has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The emergency brake valve continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations.|$|R
