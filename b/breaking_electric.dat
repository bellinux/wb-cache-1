The final superexchange Hamiltonian in two dimensions is expressed in terms of Gell-Mann matrices that break down as three spin operators and five nematic (quadrupole) order operators. Mean-field phase diagram exhibits a rich structure including anti-ferro-orbital, ferro-orbital, and both single and multiple spiral-orbital phases. Superexchange calculation for spinful, two-orbital model also strongly suggests a robust chiral-orbital order in the ground state. Comment: 6 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{noise is}} an area of {{fundamental}} importance that reveals information about the system that transport or optical measurements cannot. The present work focuses on recent advances made in the area of noise in nanodevices. This area is attracting increasing attention because noise in nanostructures is qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in bulk systems. Chapter 1 discusses different kinds of noise in nanostructures with a focus on 1 /f noise. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to find velocity as a function of time to calculate velocity autocorrelation function and noise spectral density. The spectrum has 1 /f^ 2 dependence which is universal irrespective of electric field and temperature which implies that it is a fundamental effect. In analogy with electronic noise spin noise is studied in Chapter 2. Fluctuation in spin polarization of carriers in semiconductor structures gives rise to spin noise. Spin transport is simulated using Monte-Carlo simulator in presence of D’yakonov-Perel’ spin relaxation mechanism. The symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>electric</b> field which induces Rashba field is changed in magnitude and direction. Random spatial variation of the Rashba field causes little difference in temporal spin relaxation characteristics in the regime of high-field transport. Spin does not relax monotonically with position but a non-monotonic chaotic trend is observed when Rashba field is varied randomly in magnitude or direction. Chapter 3 discusses electrochemical self-assembly technique employed to fabricate highly ordered nanowires. This nanofabrication technique can be used to grow highly ordered and size controlled nanowires and quantum dots of different materials. Cadmium sulfide nanowires are grown using this method and their infrared photodetectivity is studied. We observe twice as much increase in current under illumination at any given bias...|$|E

40|$|Gauge {{theories}} in 2 + 1 dimensions whose gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to a finite group enjoy a quantum group symmetry {{which includes the}} residual gauge symmetry.

40|$|Due {{to limited}} {{internal}} volume, often a high density of equipment installations is present on board an aircraft. For this reason, {{in case of}} a device failure, every component installed in close proximity could be damaged, causing a catastrophic domino effect. This paper presents a guided procedure for the Zonal Safety Analysis (ZSA) performed during the airplane conceptual design. This methodology allows aerospace engineers to carry out a devices installation on the aircraft taking into account the possible interactions among them in case of failure. In the Zonal Safety Analysis methodology, each equipment is characterized by a risk score, evaluating various types of accidents, for example mechanical <b>breaks,</b> <b>electric</b> damages, explosions. Considering every installed device and the possible spread of damages, a global risk score is obtained, which should be minimized in order to obtain a safer project as possible. In order to allow the engineer to conduct a Zonal Safety Analysis, a computer-aided software based on the ZSA methodology has been realized and presented in this paper. Thanks to a Graphical User Interface (GUI), many trade-off studies can be rapidly carried out and the safest solution can be designed. First, the tool requires the user to define the bays in which the aircraft is partitioned. Then, for each zone, the engineer selects all the equipment (e. g. avionic devices, electric generators, actuators, pumps) to be installed. These components and relative risk scores are included in a database compiled within the tool. Once every equipment has been selected, the risk level of every zone is evaluated, taking into account the possible interactions among all the close systems. Finally, the tool estimates the global risk score. All the results are shown to the user by means of tables and graphs. The engineer should comply the necessary changes (e. g. varying components location) in order to obtain a better design from a safety point of view. In the final part of the paper, a test case of the Zonal Safety Analysis methodology applied to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is presented. The obtained results are reported and discussed. This example demonstrates that the realized software can be useful to conduct a preliminary design a safer airplan...|$|R
