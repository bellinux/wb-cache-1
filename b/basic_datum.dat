40|$|It {{is common}} among {{philosophers}} who {{take an interest}} in the phenomenon of vagueness in natural language not merely to acknowledge higher-order vagueness but to take its existence as a <b>basic</b> <b>datum</b> — so that views that lack the resources to account for it, or that put obstacles in the way, are regarded as deficient just on that score. My main purpose in what follows is to loosen the hold of this deeply misconceived idea. Higher-order vagueness is no <b>basic</b> <b>datum</b> but an illusion, fostered by misunderstandings of the nature of ordinary (if you will, ‘first-order’) vagueness itself.

40|$|Proposed {{measures}} of {{autonomic nervous system}} functioning within an individual were reviewed. An {{important factor in the}} choice of such measures is the recogni-tion that the magnitude response to stimulation is influenced, to a large extent, by the state of the individual prior to stimulation. From {{the point of view of}} informa-tional content, there is little difference between the use of the magnitude change score and response level as the <b>basic</b> response <b>datum</b> when used in conjunction with the initial level. Consideration of the concept of the autonomic lability score as well as the mean response score reveals that neither measure adequately cor-rects nor compensates for the effect of prestimulus level. Several magnitude meas-ures suggested for the comparison of individuals include the slope of the regres-sion of change score on initial level, variability around this line, a measure of discriminability, and a measure of maximal reactivity. The temporal aspects of the autonomic response are discussed and, because of their lack of dependence on prestimulus level, two measures are extracted for each aspect—the mean and variability. 1 / UNDAMENTAL to many investigations in the field of psychophysiology is the ability to identify differences between individuals. This requires not only the appropriate instrumentation for the measurement of various autonomic re...|$|R
50|$|Many {{assume that}} {{liberalism}} intrinsically lacks any adequate theory of exploitation because its phenomenon commits itself {{only to the}} primacy of personal rights and liberties and to individual choice as the <b>basic</b> explanatory <b>datum.</b> Hillel Steiner provided an argument to refute the claim that liberalism cannot supply an adequate theory of exploitation. He discusses interpersonal transfers and how there are three types: donation, exchange, and theft. Exchange is the only of the three that consists of a voluntary bilateral transfer, where the beneficiary receives something at a value greater than zero on the shared scale of value, although at times there can be ambiguity between more complex types of transfer. He describes the three dimensions of transfers as either unilateral/bilateral, voluntary/involuntary, and equal/unequal. Despite these types of transfers being able to distinguish {{the differences in the}} four types of transfers, {{it is not enough to}} provide a differentiating characterization of exploitation. Unlike theft, an exploitative transfer is bilateral and the items are transferred voluntarily at both unequal and greater-than-zero value. The difference between a benefit and exploitation despite their various shared features is a difference between their counterfactual presuppositions, meaning that in an exploitation there's a voluntary bilateral transfer of unequally valued items because the possessors of both items would voluntarily make the transfer if the items to be transferred were of equal value, but in a benefit the possessor of the higher-value item would not voluntarily make the transfer if the items were at equal value. Put simply, the exploitation can be converted to an exchange: both exploiters and exploiter would voluntarily become exchangers when benefactors would not.|$|R

40|$|The ideas {{presented}} in this paper have arisen during the work on a database system designed for the description and comparison of human languages in a theoretically well-founded and systematic way. The Cross-linguistic Reference Grammar (CRG) is a database application for unified descriptions of natural languages of any kind, including sign languages, that has been developed over the last decade at LMU Munich. The core of the application is an XML-based client-server-DBMS called Systematics (Nickles 2001) that implements a class system of linguistic phenomena as a kind of Be-Have-tree (Peterson 2002). Examples are uniformly coded in one of the interlinear representation formats provided by CRG for three ontological categories and modalities of linguistic signs: spoken, signed, and written (Zaefferer 2003). The present paper is about one of the criteria of adequacy that has informed CRG system design from the beginning. I call it pro-competitivess and by a pro-competive database I understand a database that is designed to include dissenting entries or competing descriptions, i. e., entries that share a common <b>basic</b> <b>datum</b> to be described, but disgree on the way it is described or categorized. This is to be contrasted with apodictic databases, where no <b>basic</b> <b>datum</b> can possibly be assigned more than one category or description...|$|E
30|$|Elevation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} parameters in flood analysis (Fig.  5 a), and occurrence of PFF in highly elevated areas is nearly impossible [34]. Water flows from highly elevated areas toward lower regions. Consequently, probability of any type of flood event is naturally high in low altitude or flat terrains. Rather than digital terrain model (DTM), digital surface model (DSM) must be considered in calculating altitude parameter because of the urban pattern of this study area, wherein high-rise buildings and other facilities act as flood obstacles. However, other topographical factors related to flood occurrence were derived from DTM. Thus, a highly precise DTM presents a significant <b>basic</b> <b>datum</b> [35].|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{strength}} and accumulated plastic strain are two important parameters {{for evaluating the}} dynamic response of soil. As a special clay, the remolded red clay is often used as the high speed railway subgrade filling, but studies on its dynamic characteristics are few. For a thorough analysis of the suitability of the remolded red clay as the subgrade filling, a series of long-term cyclic load triaxial test under different load histories are carried out. Considering the influence of compactness, confining pressure, consolidation ratio, vibration frequency and dynamic load to the remolded red clay dynamic property, the tests obtain the development curves of the dynamic {{strength and}} accumulated plastic strain under different test conditions. Then, through curve fitting method, two different hyperbolic models respectively for the dynamic strength and accumulated plastic strain are built, which can match the test datum well. By applying the dynamic strength model, the critical dynamic strength of the remolded red clay are gained. Meanwhile, for providing <b>basic</b> <b>datum</b> and reference for relevant projects, all key parameters for the dynamic strength and accumulated plastic strain of the remolded red clay are given in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The Rasch simple {{logistic}} model {{is used to}} examine the relative item parameter values of a personality inventory with respect to populations cross classified by sex and country. If the model holds across populations these values should be statistically equivalent. However, while the items conform to the model within each of the populations, half the items show significant discrepancies among the populations. These discrepancies are interpreted both statistically and substantively in terms of main effects and interactions. ONE very direct method for improving accuracy of measurement in the physical sciences is to repeat the measuring experiment and then to summarize, usually by averaging, the separate measurements. The same principle for improving the accuracy of measurement is also used in educational and psychological testing. However, if the usual test item is used to provide the <b>basic</b> <b>datum,</b> then there are good rea-sons for not using the same item many times. Instead, different items must be used. In this case, if a single trait is still envisaged as being measured, then it is necessary to demonstrate that all items measure essentially the same trait, that is, that they are homogeneous or inter-nally consistent. For such a demonstration the most popular tradi-tional methods involve formulae such as the Kuder-Richardson For-mula 20 (KR 20) ...|$|E
