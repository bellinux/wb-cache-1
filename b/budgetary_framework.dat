40|$|Abstract. Research on {{the size}} of the public sector has {{demonstrated}} a robust empirical relationship: Government spending tends to increase with the number of parties in power. Theoretical explanations for this finding argue that spending constitutes a “common pool resource ” problem, which is more difficult to solve for multiparty governments than for single-party administrations because doing so requires the cooperation of actors who are electorally accountable to separate constituencies. Drawing on recent findings that demon-strate that the institutions of the policy-making process are central to the ability of coalition governments to deal more generally with the principal-agent problems of joint governance, we re-examine the relationship between the number of governing parties and spending. We argue that <b>budgetary</b> <b>frameworks</b> that reduce the influence of individual parties in bud-get formulation, and increase incentives for parties to oppose spending demands by their partners, significantly mitigate the CPR logic, and reduce the expansionary effects of larger coalitions.

40|$|Summary: The ‘Six Pack’ forms {{part of the}} {{economic}} governance reforms which are being implemented {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of the current sovereign debt crisis in the Euro Area. This legislative package involves strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact, with stronger financial sanctions and more focus on debt; a new directive on national <b>budgetary</b> <b>frameworks</b> and a new framework to monitor and correct macroeconomic imbalances. Furthermore, the implementation of the ‘Six Pack’ also involves procedural reforms, in particular reverse majority voting, as well as more oversight by the European Parliament. Inter-institutional negotiations on the ‘Six Pack’ took over a year. In the meantime, the sovereign debt crisis had deepened and broadened, implying that the ‘Six Pack’ may have come ‘too late’. The ‘Six Pack’ has also proved to be ‘too little’ to address the crisis and by the time it entered into force, further measures and proposals to strengthen economic governance had to be made. Nevertheless, the ‘Six Pack’ comprises some positive developments. In particular, recognising that fiscal policy is a matter of national sovereignty, it sets a new approach which relies on institutional reforms at national level. As such, it constitutes a first, small step to improve economic governance in the Euro Area...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} {{the validity of}} the thesis according to which Polish <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> in place in 2011 required only minor adjustments in order to be consistent with the principles set forth in the EU Council Directive on requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States adopted in November 2011. Basic elements of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> laid down in the Directive had already been provided for in Polish law. Methodology: A comparative analysis of the provisions of the Directive with relevant acts of Polish legislation, including the Public Finance Act, was carried out. The author outlines the Polish <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> before 2011 and the most important adjustments introduced by the end of 2013 {{on the basis of the}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> structure set forth in the Directive. Findings: The assessment of the convergence of provisions encompassed definitions, accounting, statistics, forecasts, numerical fiscal rules, medium-term budgetary frameworks, transparency and consistency. Its results demonstrate that Polish regulations complied with the provisions of the Directive. In order to confirm their correctness, an assessment of the practical application of recent adjustments, which entered into force in 2014, must be carried out. Constraints to research: The analysis addresses the main concepts and their most important characteristics, and therefore a synthetic approach to the subject required omitting a number of specific issues. Originality: The paper analyses the convergence of the Polish <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> in 2011 and its subsequent adjustments to the provisions of the Directive of the EU Council requiring Member States to amend their legislation by the end of 2013. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} more complete reckoning of the costs of the Iraq War, using standard economic and accounting/ <b>budgetary</b> <b>frameworks.</b> As of December 30, 2005, total spending for combat and support operations in Iraq is $ 251 bn, and the CBO's estimates put the projected total direct costs at around $ 500 bn. These figures, however, greatly underestimate the War's true costs. We estimate a range of present and future costs, by including expenditures not in the $ 500 bn CBO projection, such as lifetime healthcare and disability payments to returning veterans, replenishment of military hardware, and increased recruitment costs. We then make adjustments to reflect the social costs of the resources deployed, (e. g. reserve pay is less than the opportunity wage and disability pay is less than forgone earnings). Finally, we estimate the effects of the war on the overall performance of the economy. Even taking a conservative approach and assuming all US troops return by 2010, we believe the true costs exceed a trillion dollars. Using the CBO's projection of maintaining troops in Iraq through 2015, the true costs may exceed $ 2 trillion. In either case, the cost is much larger than the administration's original estimate of $ 50 -$ 60 bn. The costs estimated do not include those borne by other countries, either directly (military expenditures) or indirectly (the increased price of oil). Most importantly, we have not included the costs to Iraq, either in terms of destruction of infrastructure or the loss of lives. These would all clearly raise the costs significantly. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyAgainst a {{background}} of increased expenditure and improved equity, this reform of public health management in Chile, set {{in the context of}} a dual health system, aims to consolidate a cost advantage over the private sector. Emphasis has been placed on the distinction between the regulatory, financial and supply functions in the public sector, and a relative opposition of interests between them has been encouraged, with a view to generating quasi-markets. The "management commitments" entered into between the Ministry of Health and the Health Services mark a departure from the strategy of resource allocation guided by historical budgets and make results the decisive factor of funding. These commitments establish each year the types of service that are to be provided, the allocation and transfer of resources, and the performance indicators, in an overall perspective that includes the areas of programme content, financing, human resources and investment, and they govern the many dealings between the Ministry and the Health Services. The other focus of the reform is the improvement of labour productivity, to which end attempts are being made to change the existing conditions of recruitment and pay. The duality of the health model significantly limits the financial control of aspects that are endogenous to it, such as absenteeism and medical hours not worked. The changes also clash with current <b>budgetary</b> <b>frameworks,</b> which inhibit decentralized resource management.

Sound economic fundamentals and timely and forceful policy {{responses to the}} crisis, including fiscal stimulus, contributed to rapid economic recovery in the ASEAN- 5. As growth rebounds, these economies are beginning to identify, communicate and implement their strategies for unwinding the fiscal stimulus while addressing long-term growth challenges. In this context, the paper highlights the need for fiscal policies to address infrastructure gaps, stimulate private consumption and expand social safety nets. Creating fiscal space to address these challenges will require raising revenues and reorienting public spending rather than increasing borrowing. Supporting structural reforms, aiming to stimulate private infrastructure investment, could help address long-term growth challenges, while easing the burden on fiscal policy.
