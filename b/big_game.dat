The season was almost {{identical}} to the previous year: the team won its first seven games by shutout, and then lost <b>Big</b> <b>Game</b> to undefeated California. Stanford led in that game 6–0, but did not score again as California won 25–6. This <b>Big</b> <b>Game</b> is recognized as the first intercollegiate game to feature card stunts.|$|E

A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} <b>Big</b> <b>Game</b> for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E

5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most <b>big</b> <b>game</b> and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller game and fish. They relied on plants for food more than their ancestors. They were able to adapt to the shifting climate and the resulting change of animal and plant populations.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's <b>big</b> <b>game</b> had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E

5|$|In March 1909, Boyce {{embarked}} on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond {{were part of the}} expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> animals.|$|E

Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by <b>big</b> <b>game</b> hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked {{to a greater or}} lesser extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E

Stanford finished with an 8–3 record, including its first <b>Big</b> <b>Game</b> win in five years, led by Danny Carroll, who had {{won a gold medal}} in the 1908 Summer Olympics {{as a member of the}} Australia national rugby union team and who was now earning a degree in geology from Stanford. Stanford played its final rugby game against USC, who returned to American football the next year, and suffered two blowout losses to the famed New Zealand All Blacks, who were on a North American tour.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} season of rugby, Stanford {{retained}} {{head football coach}} James F. Lanagan as its first rugby coach. Lanagan had coached the football team for three years, including an undefeated 1905 season. With no experience playing or coaching rugby, Lanagan initially offered his resignation, but Stanford insisted he stay on, so he traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to study the sport. Stanford won its first five games, including two wins over a visiting club team from Vancouver. As winners of the first <b>Big</b> <b>Game</b> against California played as rugby, Stanford competed against Vancouver-area club teams for the Cooper Keith Trophy, losing two games and tying one.|$|E
