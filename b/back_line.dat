5|$|Each half of {{the pitch}} is then divided again by a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each <b>back</b> <b>line.</b> Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> and marked by flags {{at the side of the}} pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> (this replaced long corners).|$|E
5|$|A half-way line, {{parallel}} to the <b>back</b> <b>line,</b> divides the pitch in two. The start of each period of play and resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. The line was also used for the obselete offside rule.|$|E

The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at the sidelines and 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post of height 1.201.50m.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal played league challengers Manchester United on 11 April 1999. Neither {{team was}} able to score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. David Beckham opened the scoring for United from a long range shot, but Bergkamp equalised with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. United captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences, with his team playing the last thirty minutes of normal time a man down. In injury time, Phil Neville fouled Parlour in the penalty area, conceding a penalty. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time. Giggs scored partway through {{the second half of}} extra time. Picking up possession on the halfway line after a loose pass from Patrick Vieira, he dribbled past the entire Arsenal <b>back</b> <b>line</b> before shooting just under Seaman's bar. Giggs ran celebrating towards the United fans, and the team held on win 2–1. The goal was the last ever scored in a FA Cup semi-final replay; it was to be abolished from the following season.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{shoulder}} injury that had limited Zakuani's ability to play the full 90 minutes per game forced him to undergo surgery during the off-season. In his second professional year, Zakuani scored ten goals, equalling the score of striker Fredy Montero for the team lead. He also made six assists. Zakuani was named MLS Player of the Week twice; the first was after recording both goals in a 2–1 win over Colorado, and the second was awarded for both a goal and an assist in a 2–1 victory over Chivas USA. Fans around the league voted the strike against Chivas as the Goal of the Week. Zakuani also won the award for his perfectly timed break past the defensive <b>back</b> <b>line</b> for a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper while scoring a goal against Toronto FC. He also recorded the fastest-scored goal in club history with a fourth-minute tally against Columbus Crew, beating the previous record he had set the season before. Zakuani was again in the starting line-up for the 2010 U.S. Open Cup final, which Seattle won {{to become the first}} team since 1983 to repeat as Open Cup champions. On 7 November 2010, he scored the Sounders' first ever playoff goal in a 2–1 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy. He received his green card after the season; this helped the team because MLS limits the number of international players available to each team and receiving permanent resident status exempted him from the cap.|$|E
30|$|The front-only lining {{patterns}} that were manufactured for suit pants were for 100 % {{of the companies}} participating (13 out of 13), while the casual pants response for front-only lining patterns was 38.5 % (5 brands out of 13). The reason that the front-only lining was used for menswear pants, was that if the <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> existed, it would disturb {{the movement of the}} wearer. The fit of the pant would not be as comfortable as possible and could cause the lining to become twisted. Thus, it is the general case that all suit pants do not have a <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> piece. There are some exceptions to this guideline, however. If the outer shell fabric of the pant is too rough or too sheer, then a <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> piece is used to for comfort and modesty.|$|R

To ensure that the outer shell is comfortable when worn, the lining pattern had ease on the circumference and length, even though the <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> panel hangs freely within the pant shell. Due to the horizontal and vertical ease, a specific shifting amount was necessary to {{increase the size of}} the lining pattern. The length of the <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> panel could be adjusted to reach just below the crotch level or below the knee level.|$|R
