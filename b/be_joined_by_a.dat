25|$|The {{combined}} fleet {{carried a}} large number of soldiers, intended by Napoleon to be used to attack British possessions in the Caribbean. Villeneuve felt however that his orders were not clear, and remained at Fort-de-France, hoping to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fleet under Honoré Ganteaume, which unbeknownst to him had been unable to break the blockade of Brest. For two weeks Villeneuve lingered in the bay, until finally being persuaded by Villaret de Joyeuse to use his forces to capture Diamond Rock, a thorn in his side for the past seventeen months. Villeneuve gave Captain Julien Cosmao of the 74-gun Pluton command of the expedition. He was to take his ship, the 74-gun , the 36-gun Sirène, a corvette, schooner, eleven gunboats, and between three and four hundred soldiers (in addition to the ships' crews), and retake the rock.|$|E

500|$|Although the French Atlantic Fleet, principally {{based at}} the major seaport of Brest, had played no {{significant}} part in the campaign, {{it was decided that}} in order to relieve some of the pressure on the fleet in Cadiz, minor squadrons would be sent to prey on British trade in the Atlantic, hopefully drawing off some of Nelson's ships in pursuit. One such squadron was a force under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, consisting of five ships of the line, two frigates and two corvettes, which sailed from Brest for operations in the North Atlantic on 12 July. [...] A second squadron was placed under Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite, with the ship of the line Régulus, frigates Président and Cybèle and corvette Surveillant. L'Hermite was ordered to sail to West Africa, raiding merchant vessels and slave ships that operated among the numerous British trading posts along the coastline. At an undetermined point in the cruise, L'Hermite would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> larger squadron under Captain Jérôme Bonaparte, [...] Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's brother. [...] The reinforced squadron would include over 1,000 French soldiers who would be used in an attack on one of the British West African trading posts. If the post could be successfully captured, it could be turned into a naval base for use by French commerce raiders and would force the British to deploy a full squadron from the Channel Fleet in response, at a time when every ship of the line was needed for the Trafalgar campaign.|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish {{preparations}} {{to intervene}} in the succession dispute alarmed the Dutch statholder Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, who supported John Sigismund of Brandenburg, and knew that the Spanish intervention would destabilize the course of succession. In the middle of June, William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg warned Prince Maurice that the Spaniards already had 9,800 men ready for field service, and that they would soon <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> further force of 13,200 men. With the imminent Spanish threat, Maurice strongly reinforced the garrison of Jülich with seven infantry companies, and an additional force of 2,000 men, for a possible siege. The situation was tense for the two sides. Maurice, with additional troops from towns that were not under serious threat, expected to be able to raise an army of 20,000 men, composed of 136 infantry companies and 40 cavalry companies.

2500|$|Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Lieberich, who had {{the full}} {{confidence}} of the emperor, became largely responsible for developing Austria's war plan. Mack's strategy called for 120,000 troops in Italy commanded by Charles, 25,000 in the County of Tyrol under Archduke John of Austria, 70,000 in Bavaria under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este, and 20,000 in reserve. Mack would accompany Ferdinand's force, which would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Russian army and attack across the Rhine River into France. Charles would sweep across Italy and invade southern France. It was hoped that the Kingdom of Prussia could be induced to join the coalition. Mack convinced Emperor Francis I that he should invade Bavaria first, while Charles marked time in Italy. The general believed {{that by the time}} Napoleon intervened in Bavaria, the Russian army would have arrived to help the Austrians. This erroneous assumption caused Mack and the war hawks to fall into [...] "a comedy of errors". Foreseeing trouble with Mack's plan, Charles talked the emperor into transferring 30,000 soldiers from Italy to Germany, but these troops would arrive too late to remedy the situation.|$|E

2500|$|The Third Age is an RPG in {{the style}} of the games in the Final Fantasy series. The game's turn-based combat system is similar to Final Fantasy Xs [...] "Conditional Turn-Based" [...] system (CTB), which {{replaced}} the [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] system (ATB) used from Final Fantasy IV to Final Fantasy IX. The primary difference between the ATB and the CTB is that in the CTB system, time pauses as the player selects commands, whereas in the ATB system, time continues to pass. As such, in the ATB system, even when the player is selecting actions, the enemy can continue to attack. In the CTB system, however, the enemy will not attack the player until the player has had their turn. During battle, a [...] "battle queue" [...] is displayed on-screen. This shows the order in which the player's party and the enemy will take their turns. However, the order of battle can be changed by using abilities to slow down or stun the enemy, or speed up the player characters. Likewise, the enemies can increase their own speed and decrease the party's, again changing the order. The queue changes each time a turn is completed. The player can only have three active party members in any given battle, but in most battles, they are free to switch party members in and out of combat. Occasionally, the player will <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fourth member, who is usually a character from the films, and is controllable for one or two battles only.|$|E

I might quote {{many other}} forms of experiment, some old and some new, in which {{induction}} in curved or contorted lines takes place, but think it unnecessary after the preceding results; I shall therefore mention but two. If a conductor A, (fig. 111.) be electrified, and an uninsulated metallic ball B, or even a plate, provided the edges be not too thin, be held before it, a small electrometer at c or at d, uninsulated, will give signs of electricity, opposite in its nature to that of A, and therefore caused by induction, although the influencing and influenced bodies cannot <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> right line passing through the air. Or if, the electrometers being removed, a point be fixed {{at the back of}} the ball in its uninsulated state as at C, this point will become luminous and discharge the conductor A. The latter experiment is described by Nicholson[A], who, however, reasons erroneously upon it. As to its introduction here, though it is a case of discharge, the discharge is preceded by induction, and that induction must be in curved lines.|$|E

These troops, with such militia as could be collected, Washington hoped would be sufficient to save the fort. Before they could form a junction, however, and reach their destination, Cornwallis appeared before it. A defence against such superior force was hopeless. The works were abandoned; they were taken possession of by the enemy who proceeded to destroy them. After the destruction had been accomplished, the reinforcements from the North, so long and so anxiously expected, and so shamefully delayed, made their appearance.
