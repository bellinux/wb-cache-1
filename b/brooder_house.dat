These relationships have been well established for comparisons of embryonic development across species; however, very {{little is known about}} these relationships within a species. The hypothesis was tested that survival of embryos in turkey eggs could be changed by manipulating incubation periods. Fertile eggs were obtained three times from the same breeder flocks (two strains). Two incubator temperature treatments were used to create two different incubation periods for the eggs. Eggs produced at 33 weeks of age hatched better at shorter incubation periods, eggs produced at 43 weeks of age hatched equally well at both incubation temperatures, and eggs produced at 54 weeks of age hatched better at longer incubation periods. Livability for 5 days in <b>brooder</b> <b>houses</b> was highly variable but indicated survival differences between strains. Additionally, longer incubation periods produced poults that lived better than did controls.

40|$|International audienceBecause {{thermophilic}} Campylobacter spp. {{are known}} to be common in chicken flocks reared extensively, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were carried out on organic and free-range farms to determine the onset of colonisation (lag phase) and likely sources of flock infection. For 14 organic and 14 free range flocks, there was a statistically significant (P < 0. 01) difference in lag phases, with the former being colonised at a mean of 14. 1 days in comparison with 31. 6 days for the latter. Whereas most free-range flocks became colonised when released onto pasture, those reared organically were usually colonised at the <b>housed</b> <b>brooding</b> stage. Further study of organic flocks on three farms over seven successive crop cycles confirmed that colonisation was strongly influenced by the prevailing husbandry conditions and was not a consequence of the length of the rearing period. Molecular epidemiological investigations on a farm showing the shortest lag phase, using PFGE typing with two different restriction enzymes (SmaI and KpnI) and flaA SVR sequence typing, revealed that potential sources of colonisation for organic chickens were already present on the farm at the time of chick placement. Such sources included the ante area of the <b>brooding</b> <b>house,</b> surrounding pasture and other livestock being kept on the farm. Overall, the study demonstrated that, under UK conditions, the prevalence of colonisation was greater in extensive flocks (95 - 100 %) than it was for conventional broilers (55 %), similar to the situation in other countries, but all three management systems showed comparable levels of caecal carriage in positive birds (log 10 /g 6. 2 - 6. 7) ...|$|R

An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 15. 5 % is predicted for the six-week system which remains viable under a 'worst case' scenario (IRR of 12. 6 %).
