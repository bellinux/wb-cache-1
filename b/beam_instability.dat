5000|$|As {{an example}} calculation, let the phase shift &delta;=0, {{which would be}} close to the case for the TM01 mode by design and {{unfortunately}} likely to occur for a few HOM's. Having &delta;=0 (or an integer multiple of an RF mode's period, &delta;=n2&pi;) gives the worse-case wakefield build-up, where successive bunches are maximally decelerated by previous bunches' wakefields and give up even more energy than with only their [...] "self wake". Then, taking &omega; = 2&pi; 500 MHz, Tb=1 µs, and QL=106, the buildup of wakefields would be Vss wake=637×Vwake. A pitfall for any accelerator cavity would be the presence of what is termed a [...] "trapped mode". This is an HOM that does not leak out of the cavity and consequently has a QL that can be orders of magnitude larger than used in this example. In this case, the buildup of wakefields of the trapped mode would likely cause a <b>beam</b> <b>instability.</b> The <b>beam</b> <b>instability</b> implications due to the Vss wake wakefields is thus addressed differently for the fundamental accelerating mode TM01 and all other RF modes, as described next.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of the 1. 5 -GeV storage ring light source TLS in SRRC has been limited by a longitudinal coupled-bunch <b>beam</b> <b>instability.</b> To improve the {{performance of}} the TLS, the <b>beam</b> <b>instability</b> has to be suppressed. One possible way considered for the TLS to suppress its coupled-bunch instability uses uneven filling patterns according to the theory of Prabhakar[1]. By knowing the harmful high-order-modes (HOMs), a special filling pattern can be designed to utilize either mode coupling or Landau damping to cure <b>beam</b> <b>instability.</b> In TLS the HOMs are contributed from the Doris RF cavity installed in the storage ring. The HOMs of a 3 -D Doris cavity was numerically analyzed. Filling patterns with equal bunch current according to theory had been calculated to cure the most harmful HOM. A longitudinal particle tracking program was used to simulate the coupled-bunch <b>beam</b> <b>instability</b> with both the uniform filling and the special designed filling. Filling pattern with unequal bunch current was also studied. The results of the simulation were discussed and compared to the theory. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} a series of 2 D {{simulations}} to study the <b>beam</b> <b>instability</b> and cyclotron maser instability (CMI) with the initial condition that a population of tenuous energetic electrons with a ring-beam distribution is present in a magnetized background plasma. In this paper, weakly relativistic cases are discussed with the ring-beam kinetic energy ranging from 25 to 100 keV. The beam component leads to the two-stream or <b>beam</b> <b>instability</b> at an earlier stage, and the beam mode is coupled with Langmuir or whistler mode, leading to excitation of beam-Langmuir or beam-whistler waves. When the beam velocity is large with a strong <b>beam</b> <b>instability,</b> the initial ring-beam distribution is diffused in the parallel direction rapidly. The diffused distribution may still support CMI to amplify the X 1 mode (the fundamental X mode). On the contrary, when the beam velocity is small and the <b>beam</b> <b>instability</b> is weak, CMI can amplify the Z 1 (the fundamental Z mode) effectively while the O 1 (the fundamental O mode) and X 2 (the second harmonic X mode) modes are very weak and the X 1 mode is not excited. In this report, different cases with various parameters are presented and discussed for a comprehensive understanding of ring-beam instabilities...|$|E

In this paper we present the first results of the commissioning of the passive third harmonic cavities in the MAX IV 3 GeV ring.

40|$|Plasma {{magnetohydrodynamics}} and macro-instability {{theories are}} briefly reviewed. Although {{the configuration of}} any EBIS is inherently susceptible {{to a number of}} classical <b>beam</b> <b>instabilities,</b> the small radial dimension of an EBIS plasma prevents modes from occurring in EBIS traps with low beam compression due to physical limitations. In EBIS devices with high electron beam compression, where the potential for <b>beam</b> <b>instabilities</b> is great, the radial dimension is smaller than the Debye length, which renders any plasma theory invalid. However, a RHIC EBIS is expected to have a diameter which is much larger than the Debye length. Hence, it may be the first EBIS, in which the various plasma theories could be valid. For this and future devices like it, a framework is established to analyze and offer remedies plasma instabilities in EBIS...|$|R

I wish to concentrate, here, on the interaction of a relativistic particle beam with itself which is a result of the coupling of the beam with its surroundings. Before approaching this topic, a few remarks on the existing review papers are in order. A comprehensive treatment of <b>beam</b> <b>instabilities</b> may be found in Ref. 1, where, also, the reader will find some 48 references to the original literature.
