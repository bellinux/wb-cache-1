Current telemetering systems are too heavy and offer too few channels for successful application to the investigation of supersonic test vehicles. A study of the available systems indicates three factors which are uniformly insufficient. These factors are (1) the duplication of circuitry incident to the use of a separate amplifier for each channel; (2) inefficient methods of electronic commutation; (3) water of power by the continuous excitation of measuring bridges. A system is proposed which obviates these three points of inefficiency. A single amplifier for the whole system and a commutation scheme using a <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit</b> and a resistance matrix reduce the tube requirements for these two functions from 480 tubes to 45. Power is conserved by exciting the measuring bridges only during the time that information is desired from them. This process reduces the power requirements for bridge excitation from the power required for continuous excitation by a factor equal to the reciprocal of the number of channels. Following these principles, circuits were constructed which indicate that the proposed system seems entirely practical. Such a system should be lighter than any of the present ones and also capable of providing at least four times as many channels. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of p-Pb collisions {{allows us to}} study cold nuclear effects {{in order to establish}} a baseline for the interpretation of heavy ion results. ALICE has measured nuclear modification factors in minimum bias p-Pb collisions with respect to the pp reference for a large variety of probes ranging from inclusive hadrons to heavy flavor and jets. The next step would be to measure the centrality dependence of these observables. To this end, the <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> factors (Ncoll) between pp and p-Pb have to be determined for each centrality class. Centrality measurements rely on integrated multiplicty or energy measurments in the forward direction. However, these centrality observables are themselves sensitive to particle production from multiple semi-hard scatterings leading, in general, to a violation of simple <b>binary</b> <b>scaling.</b> We will discuss centrality measurements in ALICE and the biases on <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> on the example of inclusive charged hadron production and model calculations...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} focused on {{simulating}} a trajectory point {{towards the end of}} the first experimental heatshield of the FIRE II vehicle, at a total flight time of 1639. 53 s. Scale replicas were sized according to <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> and instrumented with thermocouples for testing in the X 1 expansion tube, located at The University of Queensland. Correlation of flight to experimental data was achieved through the separation, and independent treatment of the heat modes. Preliminary investigation indicates that the absolute value of radiant surface flux is conserved between two <b>binary</b> <b>scaled</b> models, whereas convective heat transfer increases with the length scale. This difference in the scaling techniques result in the overall contribution of radiative heat transfer diminishing to less than 1 % in expansion tubes from a flight value of approximately 9 - 17 %. From empirical correlation's it has been shown that the St âˆšRe number decreases, under special circumstances, in expansion tubes by the percentage radiation present on the flight vehicle. Results obtained in this study give a strong indication that the relative radiative heat transfer contribution in the expansion tube tests is less than that in flight, supporting the analysis that the absolute value remains constant with <b>binary</b> <b>scaling...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} approach, using a Variac or a power <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{reduces the}} B+ supply voltage {{available to the}} power tubes thus producing power tube distortion at a reduced level such that all available output power {{is sent to the}} guitar speaker. The Variac method is not without risk, as the reduced heater voltage applied to the tubes can damage the filament and/or cathode if not operated within the manufacturer's specifications. In a power <b>scaling</b> <b>circuit,</b> by decreasing just the B+ plate voltage, the cathode bias and screen grid voltage decrease proportionately, while the filament voltage stays constant. However the term power attenuator may be a misnomer for this type of power control because lowering B+ voltage tends to increase distortion, whereas according to convention, an attenuator should not introduce distortion.|$|R

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} techniques {{are used to}} model the flow and pressure distribution around the forebody of the HYFLEX hypersonic flight vehicle. We compare numerical simulation results with modified Newtonian theory and flight data to determine {{the accuracy of the}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique used. The numerical simulations closely match the trends in flight data, and show that real gas effects have a small but significant influence on the nose pressure distribution. We also present pressure results from a scale-model tested in a shock tunnel, and compare them with simulation results. For the shock tunnel experiment, the model was placed such that part of the upper surface was in a region of the test flow where nonuniformities were significant, and it was shown that the numerical simulation could adequately capture these experimental flow features. The <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> parameter (describing the similarity in species dissociation between flight and model) was used to design the scale-model tests in the shock tunnel, and its effectiveness is discussed. We find that matching the flight Mach number in the shock tunnel experiment is not critical for reproducing flight pressure data, so long as flight velocity is matched, and <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> is maintained...|$|R
40|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>scaling</b> is a similitude law used {{to study}} the {{aerothermodynamics}} of hypersonic vehicles in ground-based high-enthalpy facilities. It enables the duplication of shock layer flows {{in the vicinity of}} the stagnation point, including binary chemistry and nonequilibrium processes, over length scales that are practical for experimental testing. It is built on the assumption of a flow devoid of radiation coupling, which drastically narrows down the envelope of flows for which <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> can be used. Indeed, if it is strong enough, radiative heat transfer will cause a substantial amount of energy to leak out of the shock layer to the free-stream and other flow regions. As demonstrated in this paper, the strength of that coupling will increase as the length-scale of the flow increases, impacting other flow properties such as its chemical composition or temperature. The resulting impact on macroscopic features of the flow are for example a reduction of the wall heat flux (both convective and radiative) or of the shock standoff distance. These side impacts are identified with experimental measurements on the shock standoff distance in an expansion tube with COâ€“N mixture flows representative of the venusian atmosphere over cylinders...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the nonequilibrium flow of dissociating gases over spheres was {{investigated}} experimentally, numerically and theoretically. A series of experiments with three different gases, nitrogen, air and carbon dioxide, was performed in the shock tunnel T 5 at GALCIT. Five spheres of different radii equipped with thermocouples for surface heat flux measurements were used. The state-of-the-art numerical method by Candler (1988) was used to conduct a parallel study which strongly complemented the experimental and theoretical efforts. Experimental heat flux measurements are presented. Good agreement was observed among the measured stagnation point heat transfer rates, computational results and Fay and Riddellâ€™s theoretical predictions. For nitrogen and air, the measured heat flux distributions were also in good agreement with numerical computation results and Leesâ€™ theory. For carbon dioxide, large deviations were observed. Early transition tripped by surface roughness is a possible cause for the deviation of heat flux distribution from the theory. The experimental differential interferograms were compared with the images constructed from computational flowfields. Good agreement of fringe pattern and shock shape was observed. An analytical solution is obtained for inviscid hypervelocity dissociating flow over spheres. The solution explains {{the correlation between the}} dimensionless stand-off distance and the dimensionless reaction rate parameter previously observed by Hornung (1972) for nitrogen. The physics of the correlation can be shown as the <b>binary</b> <b>scaling.</b> Based on the solution, a new dimensionless reaction rate parameter is defined to generalize Hornungâ€™s correlation for more complex gases than nitrogen. Experimental and numerical results confirm the new correlation. The effect of nonequilibrium recombination downstream of a curved two-dimensional shock was also addressed. An analytical solution for an ideal dissociating gas was obtained, giving an expression for dissociation fraction as a function of temperature on a streamline. The solution agrees well with the numerical result and provides a rule of thumb to check the validity of <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> for the experimental conditions. The effects upon the <b>binary</b> <b>scaling</b> of the large difference in freestream temperature between flight and free-piston shock tunnel conditions are discussed...|$|R
