40|$|Consumption {{of bread}} made from flours with high {{extraction}} rates is fairly common {{in western countries}} and has recently become widespread in Iran. Such breads contain relatively high levels of phytic acid. Phytic acid {{is present in the}} aleurone layer of wheat in the form of potassium-magnesium salts. It is carried over to wheat flour and to bread. Phytic acid is known to have chelating properties and to form complexes with <b>bivalent</b> cations (<b>iron,</b> calcium, zinc and so on), thus reducing their bioavailability in humans. In addition, phytate salts can form complexes with proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in the diet, making them unavailable too. In the present study, phytic acid contents of flours (3 individual extraction rates and 2 combinations), the dough and two types of popular breads of Khorasan (Lavash & Sangak) made from these flours were determined. The results showed that the flours had, on the average, 570. 37 mg phytic acid per 100 g and that the phytic acid contents of breads were, on the average, 347. 31 mg/ 100 g.

Due to fact that electron transfer is such a broad, common, as well as essential reaction within nature, Marcus's theory has become vital within the field of chemistry.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of dissolution of pure iron oxides {{by means of}} organic acids comprises two different chemical pathways: (a) non-reductive dissolution and (b) reductive dissolution. In this paper, the thermodynamic analysis of these pathways for the iron oxides-oxalic acid system is presented. In low acid solutions (pH higher than 3) the only thermodynamically stable complex ions of <b>bivalent</b> and trivalent <b>iron</b> are [Fe 2 +(C 2 O 4) (2) ](2 -) and [Fe 3 +(C 2 O 4) (3) ](3 -). Uncomplexed Fe 2 + ion can be identified only in high acid solutions, while uncomplexed Fe 3 + ion {{is not likely to}} build-up in oxalic acid solutions. In the pH range 1 - 2 the [Fe 3 +(C 2 O 4) (2) ](-) and [Fe 3 +C 2 O 4](+) ions are stable, while at pH less than 1, the [Fe 3 +HC 2 O 4](2 +) is the only ion existing.

The synthetic protocol includes consecutive addition to distilled water of glutathione, which decreases the pH of the test solution to 4. 0, a <b>bivalent</b> <b>iron</b> salt (e. g., ferrous sulphate) and sodium nitrite at the molar ratio of 2 : 1 : 1, with a subsequent increase in pH to neutral values. Under these conditions, the amount of B-DNIC formed is limited by initial nitrite concentration. In the novel procedure, 20 mM glutathione, 10 mM ferrous sulfate and 10 mM sodium nitrite give 2. 5 mM B-DNIC with glutathione, while 5 mM glutathione remains in the solution. <b>Bivalent</b> <b>iron</b> (5 mM) is precipitated in the form of hydroxide complexes, which can be removed from the solution by passage through a paper filter. After the increase in рН to 11 and addition of thiols at concentrations exceeding that of DNIC tenfold, B-DNIC are converted into a mononuclear EPR-active form of DNIC (M-DNIC) with glutathione.

40|$|The {{removal of}} iron from silica sand with oxalic acid {{has been studied}} under various {{experimental}} conditions in order to optimise the process parameters and reach {{a high degree of}} iron removal at minimum operating cost. The parameters studied were: temperature, pH of the solution, oxalate concentration, Ar purging, and ferrous ions addition to the solution. For the specific silica sand sample used, at temperatures varying between 90 - 100 degrees C the maximum iron extraction that can be achieved is approximately 40 %. At temperatures lower than 80 degrees C this extraction is decreased to 30 %. At these temperatures purging of the oxalate solution with Ar and ferrous ions addition has no effect on the iron extraction, while at temperatures lower than 25 degrees C iron dissolution is accelerated with the addition of ferrous ions. Iron dissolution is significantly affected by the pH, while it is practically independent of the oxalate concentration and the pulp density. Without the addition of <b>bivalent</b> <b>iron,</b> iron extraction is optimised in high acid solutions; when ferrous ions are added in the oxalate solution, best results are achieved at pH 3.

40|$|Background: Dyes {{are visible}} {{materials}} and are {{considered as one}} of the hazardous components that make up the industrial waste. Dye compounds in natural water, even in very low concentrations, will lead to environmental problems. Azo dyes are compounds with one or more –N=N– groups and are used in textile industry. Because of its low price, solubility, and stability, azo dyes are widely used in the textile industry. Direct Red 81 (DR 81) is one of the azo dyes, which is removed from bodies of water, using various methods. This study aimed to assess DR 81 dye removal by Fenton oxidation and the effects of various parameters on this process. Methods: Decolorization tests by Fenton oxidation were performed at dye concentrations of 50, 500, 100 and 1000 mg/L; hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 60 and 120 mg/L; iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate concentrations of 0, 3, 5, 20 and 50 mg/L; and pH levels of 3, 5, 7 and 10 for durations of 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 180 minutes.

Hence, {{it is necessary to}} use a suitable method for its removal. The aim of this study was synthesize and efficiency evaluation of magnetic nanocomposite of activated carbon powder-zero valent iron/silver (PAC-Feo/Ag) in the removal of phenol from aqueous solution. Material & Methods: Reduction method was used for converting <b>bivalent</b> <b>iron</b> to zero valent iron and co-precipitation method for depositing of iron on activated carbon. For coating silver on nano zero valent iron, rapid mixing at high temperature was used. The adsorbent was characterized using SEM, TEM, and XRD techniques. Then, the impact of pH, contact time, agitation speed, temperature, adsorbent, and initial phenol concentration were evaluated and optimized by one factor at the time method. Reaction kinetics and isotherms were also determined. Results: It was found that PAC-Feo/Ag has cubic and intertwined structure and has a diameter in the range from 40 to 100 nm. The optimum conditions for phenol removal by PAC-Feo/Ag were as pH= 3, 90 min contact time, 200 rpm agitating speed and adsorbent concentration equal to 1 g/l. Isotherm and kinetic equations showed that the experimental data of phenol adsorption onto PAC-Feo/Ag are correlated to the Langmuir (R 2 > 0. 969) and pseudo-second order (R 2 < 0. 965) models, respectively. Conclusion: Under optimum conditions, modified adsorbent by zero valent iron and silver with maximum efficiency of 97 % has quickly and effectively ability in removal of phenol and it can be easily separated from the solution sample by magnet because of its magnetic properties...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Floodplains are {{characterized}} by periodic flooding and their soils can contain high concentrations of trace elements. The flooding events lead to varying oxygen contents in the soil. This is accompanied with varying redox conditions that are expressed by strongly fluc-tuating redox potentials. This study investigated the influence of flooding events on the mo-bilization of the trace elements arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, and zinc, {{as well as the}} volatilization of mercury in laboratory exper-iments. Material and methods. Multi-contaminated floodplain soils from the Elbe River in Lower Saxony, Germany, and the Wupper River in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, were used for the experiments. The first type of experiment was a microcosm experiment. Soil suspensions were held at fixed redox conditions in these experiments. In the first experiment we investigated the influ-ence of oxidizing (oxygen predominant), weakly reducing (tri- and tetravalent manganese reduction), and moderately reducing (trivalent iron reduction) conditions at three tempera-tures (7, 15, and 25 °C) on the solubility of ten trace elements. Soil suspensions were sam-pled at different intervals and analyzed for trace elements and accompanying parameters (iron, <b>bivalent</b> <b>iron,</b> manganese, chloride, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon). In the se-cond experiment we investigated the distribution of mercury among the solid, dissolved, and gaseous phases under moderately reducing (trivalent iron reduction) and strongly reducing (hexavalent sulfur reduction) conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) lies {{in close}} proximity to the free radical-producing electron transport chain, thus, it is highly prone to oxidative damage. Oxyphilic type of follicular thyroid carcinoma consists of cells filled – almost exclusively – with aberrant mitochondria. In turn, <b>bivalent</b> <b>iron</b> (Fe 2 +) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) are indispensable for thyroid hormone synthesis, therefore being available in physiological conditions presumably at high concentrations. They participate in Fenton reaction (Fe 2 + +H 2 O 2 →Fe 3 + + · OH[*]+[*]OH -), resulting {{in the formation of the}} most harmful free radical – hydroxyl radical (· OH). The same substrates may be used to experimentally induce oxidative damage to macromolecules. The aim of the study was to evaluate the background level of oxidative damage to mtDNA and the damaging effects of Fenton reaction substrates. Methods Thyroid mtDNA was incubated in the presence of either H 2 O 2 [100, 10, 1. 0, 0. 5, 0. 1, 0. 001, 0. 00001 mM] or FeSO 4 (Fe 2 +) [300, 150, 30, 15, 3. 0, 1. 5 μM], or in the presence of those two factors used together, namely, in the presence of Fe 2 + [30 μM] plus H 2 O 2 [100, 10, 1. 0, 0. 5, 0. 1, 0. 001, 0. 00001 mM], or in the presence of H 2 O 2 [0. 5 mM] plus Fe 2 + [300, 150, 30, 15, 3. 0, 1. 5 μM]. 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG) concentration, as the index of DNA damage, was measured by HPLC. Results Both Fenton reaction substrates, used separately, increased 8 -oxodG level for the highest H 2 O 2 concentration of 100 mM and in Fe 2 + concentration-dependent manner [300, 150, and 30 μM]. When Fe 2 + and H 2 O 2 were applied together, Fe 2 + enhanced H 2 O 2 damaging effect to a higher degree than did H 2 O 2 on Fe 2 + effect. Conclusions The level of oxidized nucleosides in thyroid mtDNA is relatively high, when compared to nuclear DNA. Both substrates of Fenton reaction, i. e. ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide, increase oxidative damage to mtDNA, with stronger damaging effect exerted by iron. High level of oxidative damage to mtDNA suggests its possible contribution to malignant transformation of thyroid oncocytic cells, which are known to be especially abundant in mitochondria, the latter characterized by molecular and enzymatic abnormalities. </p...|$|E
40|$|Transition metals {{containing}} amphiphilic compounds integrate various geometric, electronic, magnetic, and electrochemical properties {{together with}} the film forming properties. These compounds thereby find potential towards the fabrication of responsive films. This dissertation confers the synthesis and analysis of film forming properties of various redox-active metalloamphiphiles. Two new azido and thiocyanto bridged copper-based amphiphiles were synthesized and characterized by IR, UV-visible, and EPR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, and elemental analysis. The redox studies show that both these complexes exhibit redox reversibility with only the azido bridged complex showing good redox cycling of about 50 times with minimal decomposition of less than 30 mV. The UV-visible studies using coordinating solvent suggest that monomer/dimer equilibria might happen at the air/water interface. The LB {{studies show that the}} monolayer stability is maintained up to a pressure of ca. 49 mN/m when collapse occurs. The IRRAS spectra suggest high order of the deposited film. The synthesis and characterization a series of single-tailed copper(II) -containing surfactants of the type [CuII(LPY 18) X 2] with varying coligands (X) was also studied. The complexes [CuII(LPY 18) (OAc) 2], [CuII(LPY 18) (OBz) 2], [CuII(LPY 18) (acac) Br], [CuII(LPY 18) (dbm) Br], [CuII(LPY 18) (Ox) ], and [CuII(LPY 18) (1, 10 -phen) Cl]PF 6 were synthesized, isolated, and characterized. The redox characteristics change depending {{on the nature of the}} coligands without compromising the amphiphilic behavior of the complexes. The monodentate coligands (acetate and benzoate) containing complexes exhibit a quasi-reversible CuII¨CuI couple with a potential of about - 900 mV whereas the bidentate coligands such as acetylacetonate, dibenzoyl methanate, and oxalate offered irreversible multiple processes. The phenanthroline containing complex exhibited the best reversibility together with excellent cyclability. The Langmuir monolayer isotherm indicates that the films of these complexes are stable up to a pressure of about 45 mN/m. BAM studies showed intricate variations in film topology. The IRRAS studies on selected complexes indicate the presence of well-packed condensed monolayer on the surface of the substrate. Three octahedral amphiphilic metal complexes of <b>bivalent</b> <b>iron,</b> cobalt, and ruthenium were also synthesized and characterized. The iron containing complex do not show good redox behavior however, the cobalt complex shows a quasi-reversible ligand based process at E 1 / 2 = - 1379 mV and the ruthenium complex shows two ligand related processes at E 1 / 2 = - 1609 and - 2050 mV and RuII/RuIII couple at 600 mV. All the complexes reveal excellent film formation properties. The IRRAS studies display the presence the CH stretching bands at around 2850 - 2925 cm- 1. We also report on the synthesis and characterization of various copper and nickel containing complexes containing phenolate based ligands with varying substitutents. The redox studies on the nickel complexes reveal quasi-reversible ligand based process and the copper complexes show good reversibility of the copper(II) -based process. However, these amphiphilic complexes showed a compromising behavior at the air/water interface with a maximum collapse pressure of 28 mN/m. We have also presented the Langmuir-Blodgett film formation studies on various bimetallic and tetrametallic copper complexes and the effect of changes in the subphase on the film formation. A new family of pyridyl- and phenolato-containing amphiphiles such as [(LPY 18 I) RuII(bpy) 2](PF 6) 2, [(LPY 18 A) RuII(bpy) 2](PF 6) 2, [(LPhBuI) RuII(bpy) 2](PF 6), and [(LPhClI) RuII(bpy) 2](PF 6) were also described. The capability of these species as precursors for photo-responsive Langmuir-Blodgett films was evaluated. These complexes are surface active and are strong candidates for the formation of monolayer films, as characterized by compression isotherms and Brewster angle microscopy. Relative solubility in water for the ruthenium pyridyl complexes requires the presence of an aqueous NaCl subphase for proper film formation. We have also reported on the tetrametallic complex [FeII(FeIIIL 2) 3](PF 6) 2 of discoid topology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first species in which the presence of tert-butyl groups concurrently imposes redox activity and surfactancy. This result points that a modular approach can be used to develop redox-active homo and heterometallic film precursors of discoid topology...|$|E
