50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the disc seat and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a <b>bubble</b> <b>tight</b> shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|E
40|$|Diffusing-wave {{spectroscopy}} measurements {{show that}} ordinarily solid aqueous foams flow {{by a series}} of stick-slip avalanche-like rearrangements of neighboring <b>bubbles</b> from one <b>tight</b> packing configuration to another. Contrary to a recent prediction, the distribution of avalanche sizes do not obey a power-law distribution characteristic of self-organized criticality. This can be understood from a simple model of foam mechanics based on bubble-bubble interactions...|$|R
5000|$|On {{occasion}} VOKRA has {{assisted with}} wildlife rescues. A notable rescue involved a skunk named Bubbles. In August 2011, Bubbles was noticed in Vancouver's West End with her neck {{stuck in a}} plastic dome-shaped lid used for bubble tea. The skunk's situation became more dire as she grew and the lid became <b>tighter.</b> <b>Bubbles</b> eluded captors until November 2011, when VOKRA volunteer Shirley trapped her. The Wildlife Rescue Association of B.C. performed surgery to remove debris which had caused scabbing, and after 45 days of rehabilitation, Bubbles was reported ready for release on Dec. 28, 2011. The wildlife rescue later reported that Bubbles had been [...] "spotted {{in the company of}} other neighbourhood skunks and appears to be healthy and staying out of trouble." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a {{rational}} price bubble in a productive asset and its e¤ect {{on the real}} economy in an overlapping generations model of a small open economy with an analysis on a collateralized credit constraint. As a consequence, the small open economy is vunerable to the bubble emergence. Crucially for the policy-making, the credit constraint plays a double-bladed role in the bubble emergence. That is, with the natural credit limit which is evaluated at the fundamental value of the collateral, a bubble cannot exist; while, if the …nancial intermediary sets the credit limit at the expected value of the collateral, the credit constraint instead helps support the <b>bubble.</b> Hence, the <b>tight</b> …nancial regulation and supervision over the credit constraint are recommended for policymakers to prevent or terminate the bubble. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{systematic}} experimental study on bubble-mediated gas transfer. Trace gas concentrations were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer with two silicone membrane inlets in the gas and water phase of the gas <b>tight</b> <b>bubble</b> tank. Fourteen trace gases {{with a wide range}} of solubilities and diffusivities – SF 6, Neon, N 2, HD, D 2, O 2, Krypton, Pentafluoroethane, Xenon, N 2 O, C 2 H 2, CH 3 Cl, Benzene and DMS – were used to investigate the dependency on these two physico-chemical parameters. Bubbles were generated by a water jet with adjustable kinetic energy, which entrained a controllable gas volume flux into the water tank. Bubble size distributions in a radius range from 10 μm to 5000 μm and velocity distributions in a range from 70 μm to 3000 μm were measured at 60 positions by a telecentric optical setup. Invasion and evasion experiments with a variety of conditions were conducted including salt water (1. 75...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} procedure {{has been}} developed that permits measurement of the partitioning of Ar and He between crystal interiors and the intergranular medium (ITM) that surrounds them in synthetic melt-free polycrystalline diopside aggregates. ^(37) Ar and ^(4) He are introduced into the samples via neutron irradiation. As samples are crystallized under sub-solidus conditions from a pure diopside glass in a piston cylinder apparatus, noble gases diffusively equilibrate between the evolving crystal and intergranular reservoirs. After equilibration, ITM Ar and He is distinguished from that incorporated within the crystals by means of step heating analysis. An apparent equilibrium state (i. e., constant partitioning) is reached after about 20 h in the 1450 °C experiments. Data for longer durations show a systematic trend of decreasing ITM Ar (and He) with decreasing grain boundary (GB) interfacial area as would be predicted for partitioning controlled by the network of planar grain boundaries (as opposed to ITM gases distributed in discrete micro-bubbles or melt). These data yield values of GB-area-normalized partitioning, K¯^(Ar) _(ITM), with units of (Ar/m^ 3 of solid) /(Ar/m^ 2 of GB) of 6. 8 x 10 ^ 3 – 2. 4 x 104 m^(- 1). Combined petrographic microscope, SEM, and limited TEM observation showed no evidence that a residual glass phase or grain boundary micro-bubbles dominated the ITM, though they may represent minor components. If a nominal GB thickness (δ) is assumed, and if the density of crystals and the grain boundaries are assumed equal, then a true grain boundary partition coefficient (K^(Ar) _(GB) = X^(Ar) _(crystals) /X^(Ar) _(GB) may be determined. For reasonable values of δ, K^(Ar) _(GB) is at least {{an order of magnitude}} lower than the Ar partition coefficient between diopside and melt. Helium partitioning data provide a less robust constraint with K¯^(He) _(ITM) between 4 x 10 ^ 3 and 4 x 10 ^ 4 cm^(- 1), similar to the Ar partitioning data. These data suggest that an ITM consisting of nominally melt free, <b>bubble</b> free, <b>tight</b> grain boundaries can constitute a significant but not infinite reservoir, and therefore bulk transport pathway, for noble gases in fine grained portions of the crust and mantle where aqueous or melt fluids are non-wetting and of very low abundance (i. e., < 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{an economy}} (without growth) {{populated}} by overlapping generations of {{rich and poor}} agents, with the difference between them being that the rich are endowed with larger amounts of wealth in both period. Both types of agents want to transfer wealth over time and smooth out their consumptions. Agents could borrow from or lend {{to each other in}} credit market, when borrowing they are subject to a collateral constraint. Agents could also buy house(s), which are indivisible and pay no dividend whatsoever. Because of the lack of investment instruments and dynamic inefficiency in bubble-free steady states, a rational housing bubble could arise. Due to its high prices and indivisibility, houses are not affordable to the poor. So in the bubble steady states only the rich get to buy houses and enjoy the high rate of return caused by the housing bubble, while the poor are left out, implying potential distributional effect. With a relaxed collateral constraint, the market interest rate is relatively high and the rich could borrow a lot from the poor through the credit market, thus providing them (the poor) with a mean to transfer wealth across periods and benefit from the housing <b>bubble</b> indirectly. A <b>tight</b> borrowing constraint, on the other hand, limits the rich’s borrowing capacity and hurt the poor’s lifetime utility indirectly through lower market interest rate (and the resulting inefficient wealth transfer). This model could be applied to China, where we have witnessed drastic increase in housing prices during the last 15 years. Several researches and empirical evidences point towards the existence of a rational housing bubble in China. Upon a closer look at survey data from selected years we can see a rise in household consumption inequality from 1999 to 2002, and then to 2008. Other research has also found that increasing housing prices have caused much of the increase in wealth inequality in China...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study for the}} investigation of bubble-mediated gas exchange in a dedicated bubble tank is presented. Bubbles were generated by a water jet with adjustable kinetic energy, which entrained a controllable gas volume flux into the water tank. Bubble size distributions in a radius range from 10 μm to 5000 μm and velocity distributions in a range from 70 μm to 3000 μm were measured at 60 positions in the tank by a telecentric optical setup. Trace gas concentrations were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a silicone membrane inlet in the water phase of a gas <b>tight</b> <b>bubble</b> tank. Fourteen trace gases {{with a wide range}} of solubilities and diffusivities - SF 6, Ne, N 2,HD, D 2, O 2, Kr, Pentafluoroethane, Xe, N 2 O, C 2 H 2, CH 3 Cl, Benzene and DMS - were used to investigate the dependency on these two physico-chemical parameters. Evasion experiments with a variety of conditions were conducted, including salt water (1. 75 % NaCl), the addition of the soluble surfactant Triton X- 100, n-butanol and glycerol. All used additives tend to increase the fraction of small bubbles generated and therefore increase the transfer velocity at constant gas volume flux and energy input. The addition of salt had the strongest effect, leading to an enhancement of the transfer velocity up to a factor of ~ 4. The increase of the transfer velocity adding Triton X- 100 was found to be lower than 5 %. The transition between diffusivity controlled and solubility controlled transfer occurs at solubilities ranging from 0. 05 - 0. 44. The transition is shifted to lower solubilities by a factor of ~ 3 by the addition of salt. Existing models for bubble mediated gas transfer are tested. Simple power law dependencies turn out to be incapable to describe the transfer for the whole range of solubilities and diffusivities. An extension of the parameterization proposed by Woolf et al. (2007) requiring 4 parameters fits the data best. A simple model using only 2 parameters is proposed. Its performance is almost as good as the extended Woolf model...|$|R
