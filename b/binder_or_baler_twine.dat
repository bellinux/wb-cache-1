40|$|The {{large amount}} of used {{polypropylene}} <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> generated from the agricultural community may provide a low-cost, environmentally friendly source of fibre reinforcement {{that can be used}} to improve the properties of concrete. However, the performance of such fibres for the application has not yet been explored. The effectiveness of using small amounts of chopped <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> to control the restrained plastic shrinkage cracking of portland cement mortar was investigated in this study. To determine the influence of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> fibre type, length and volume fraction on their performance, two types of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> (one composed of strands with circular cross section, the other composed of flat band shape strands) in two lengths (19 mm and 38 mm) and three volume fractions (0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 3 %) were evaluated. To compare the performance of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> fibre with that of other commercially available synthetic fibres, fibrillated polypropylene fibres at equal lengths and volume fractions was investigated. The restrained plastic shrinkage tests were carried out by subjecting the fibre-reinforced mortar specimens, cast on rough substrate bases, to a wind speed of 2. 6 m/s, and relative humidity less than 3 % at 35 Â°C for 22 hours. To evaluate the effectiveness of the fibres, the crack numbers were recorded, and the maximum crack width and total crack area on the surface of each specimen were measured using an image analysis technique. Unrestrained plastic shrinkage tests were also conducted in which fibre-reinforced mortar specimens without the substrate bases were tested under the same environmental conditions. Test results indicate that both types of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> are capable of controlling restrained plastic shrinkage cracking to some extent, but are not as effective as fibrillated polypropylene. The <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> composed of band shape strands performed better than the one composed of strands with circular cross section. Compared with plain specimens, the total crack area was reduced by 95. 3, 77. 5 and 38. 7 % when 0. 3 % volume fraction of 38 mm fibrillated polypropylene, band shape <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> and circular <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> fibres, respectively, were added. Similar reductions in maximum crack width were observed. Fibre length did not significantly influence cracking behaviour. Free plastic shrinkage was significantly reduced only when long fibre lengths (38 mm) and high volume fractions (0. 3 %) were used...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, sisal {{has been}} the leading {{material}} for agricultural twine (binder <b>twine</b> and <b>baler</b> <b>twine)</b> because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater. The importance of this traditional use is diminishing with competition from polypropylene {{and the development of}} other haymaking techniques, while new higher-valued sisal products have been developed.|$|R
50|$|Founded on March 10, 1914, MFA (which {{once stood}} for Missouri Farmers Association) traces its {{beginnings}} to a one-room schoolhouse near Brunswick, Mo. In Newcomer School on March 10, 1914, seven farmers met to discuss {{an article by}} William Hirth. Hirth owned a magazine called the Missouri Farmer and Breeder. In his magazine, Hirth called for formation of farm clubs. Seven Brunswick-area farmers (Aaron Bachtel, Tom Penick, Will Heisel, George Heisel, Earl Smutz, John Kohl and Will Armstrong) met to discuss Hirth's article and soon placed the first cooperative order for 1,150 pounds of <b>baler</b> <b>twine.</b>|$|R

50|$|The chief {{advantage}} of loose-leaf paper is its flexibility and economy in use.

This ability to rearrange and update the contents of binders is convenient for students and other workers, who can carry only the papers they are likely to need on a given day, while leaving the remainder elsewhere.
