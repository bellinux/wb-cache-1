The rocks through which they have to cut are so hard and unyielding that men who had not been trained from childhood to subdue them would lose heart altogether at the weight of toil and the small return for it. Sometimes, indeed, miners are fortunate, and here, as elsewhere, lucky hits are made, {{but for the most part}} their gains are barely sufficient for their wants; and whether they are lucky or unlucky in that respect, the toil is always hard--so hard that few of them retain health or strength sufficient to go underground beyond the age of forty-five, while hundreds of them find an early grave, owing to disease resulting from their peculiar work, or to accidents.

Assessment of health risk associated with the <b>blast-hole</b> drill operators based on ISO 2631 - 1 criteria is limited. In the current study, operators’ WBV exposure was measured in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 using a tri-axial seat pad accelerometer at the operator/seat interface. WBV exposure was evaluated along all three orthogonal axes by frequency-weighted RMS acceleration and vibration dose value. Result of the study shows that mean frequency weighted RMS acceleration along Z-axis is dominant as compared to X and Y axis. In the case of VDV exposure, the mean VDV along Z-axis is also higher as compared to X and Y axis however magnitude of mean vector sum of VDV is lower compared to the Z-axis. The predicted health risk of operators based on daily RMS exposure shows that only 3. 6 % of drill machine operators were found between the recommended upper and lower limit of health caution zone of ISO standard 2631 - 1. However, based on VDV evaluation method, all the drill machine operators were found above the recommended upper limit of health caution zone of ISO standard 2631 - 1.

Both measurements are formally compared, leading to a model where a <b>blast-hole</b> {{can be considered a}} regularization of the drill information up to a nugget effect characteristic of the blast-holes. This formal link makes it possible to build a cokriging system that takes into account the different supports and leads to a block model based on blast and drill-holes.

A preliminary conclusion is that the best estimates are obtained when only blasts or alternatively, blast and drill-holes are used; there is {{no significant difference between the}} two, which is due to the great amount of blast information. This result justifies the usual practice of basing short-term planning on blasts only. But another conclusion may be drawn when kriging is compared to a moving average (another common practice), both based on blasts: depending on the number of data used in the neighborhood, the moving average produces a strong conditional bias.

Due to the high stresses imposed on the rock mass in these deep level mines, a high potential for rockbursts exists. Rockbursts cause injuries and deaths to the workers and lost production time. One of the techniques for reducing the severity of damage of face-bursts (a class of rockbursts where the mining face is ejected into the excavation) is preconditioning. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is used to quantify the change in fracture pattern with preconditioning.

40|$|Purpose. In {{this article}} it is {{necessary}} to analyze the possibility of developing technology and increasing its efficiency during the Beskidskiy tunnel construction in difficult engineering and geological conditions. Methodology. The authors have performed analysis of the technological level of mining and construction works, new technique, equipment and production. One of the important issues of blasting operation is to ensure the seismic safety, acting at a distance of 30 m in the axes of single-track tunnel, as the distance to it will be 20 m from the nearest charge in the laying tunnel. This problem was solved by applying the combined blasting of <b>blast-hole</b> charges with delay-action and long-delay ways. Herewith the total mass of charges in the stope was divided into three groups, in which the first group is exploded by short-delay firing with, and the second one is exploded by short-delay firing too with intervals of 200 … 400 ms, the third is exploded by long-delay blasting at intervals of 500 … 10000 ms. The combined blasting of short-delay charges and delay action ones let significantly reduce seismic action at a mass explosion of charges when driving of double-track railway tunnel of a large cross-section. Findings. The paper presents the developed technology model, describing dependence of the machines from engineering and geological conditions. The methodology of drilling and blasting works at the construction of the tunnel callote and stross as well as a technique of arrangement determination and intervals of shot-delay and delay blasting of blasthole explosive charges was developed. Maximum permissible concentration of gases and vapours at blasting was presented. The calculations showed that the maximum level of gas contamination of the working area in Beskidskiy tunnel is achieved at blast operations.

It is proved that when using the selective method of mining of non-metallic building materials, the quality management should be carried out taking into account the fractal nature of quality coefficients, which are determined by the developed methods. The relationship between the number of fractures and strike azimuth for ornamental stone deposits is first established, {{that can be used to}} predict the direction of mining development and management of ornamental stone extraction processes. As a result of the performed research into regularities of formation of fracturing of deposits of labradorite, we identified the main types of the samples describing the elements of occurrence, and formed the reference samples, the analysis of which allowed us to substantiate the optimal methods of cluster analysis for selecting the systems of fracturing. To predict the direction of development of mining and management of the processes of extraction of decorative stone, we obtained analytical expression of dependency of the quantity of cracks on the strike azimuth in the form of polynomial of the second degree. The relationship between the orientation of individual systems of fractures allocated according to the results of cluster analysis and optimal cleavage direction for gabbro rocks deposits is first established, that allow to develop the optimal method of the mining operations planning, taking into account the anisotropy of ornamental stone deposits properties. It is proved that for quality management and assessment of the prospects of deposits or block stone individual sections development, it is advisable to carry out the evaluation according to the number of fractures in the system that are selected by the results of fractures massif clustering and their dimensional orientation. For the estimation of prospects of development of deposits, or separate sections, we proposed the new cluster-geometric technique of determining the blockiness. In addition, the proposed technique makes it possible to estimate the probability of each of the obtained results, which significantly increases efficiency of risk assessment when designing mining works. It also allows increase in the degree of taking account of the genesis of fracturing and mutual angular correlations between the systems of fracturing, which provides for the possibility to increase the accuracy of assessment of quality of both entire deposit and its separate sections. The technique of fractal analysis of regularities in the fracturing formation for various deposits or their sections, which is based on the comparison of values of fractal dimensionality of the roses of fracturing, was developed. The groups of labradorite deposits were distinguished by index of fractal dimensionality, which allows developing standard technological solutions for each group in order to enhance the effectiveness of quality and productivity control over technological complexes. A map of spatial variability in fractal dimensionality of fracturing in the labradorite deposits of Ukraine was produced, the use of which will make it possible to increase efficiency of discovering new labradorite deposits, which will meet certain quality requirements. The construction of this map will allow enhancing efficiency of the interpretation of conditions for the formation of particular deposits. The patterns of change in fractal dimensionality at the different structural levels were established and the methods for their prediction were developed, which will make it possible, by the results of exploring fractal dimensionality at one of the structural level, to predict their values for others to optimize the process of control over geological exploration and extraction operations. As a result of the performed experimental studies, the influence of fractal dimensionality of fracturing in the <b>blast-hole</b> drilling zone on the productivity of the process was proved. We created objective function of optimal process to control technological processes, based on geostructural and technological indices that were evaluated by generalizing index of fractal dimensionality. The objective function of optimal process of drilling the fractured array, which includes indices of fractal dimensionality of the drilling zone, was proposed. For the first time the regularities of change of primary kaolin samples whiteness depending on the results of determination of colour coordinates, the fractal dimension of the sample surface, the size of scanned samples grains and fractal dimension of grains in the massif are established. For the first time the relationship between the geochemical and geostru?tural parameters of nonmetallic building materials deposits is established and the influence of their spatial variability on the effectiveness of selective extraction of nonmetallic building materials is assessed. Based on the first developed technological coefficient of the contact form, the influence of fractal dimension of conditioned areas contours on the productivity of excavation is established when using selective extraction of nonmetallic building materials. Cluster and fractal technique of determining the volumes, operational noncontact evaluation of spatial variability of quality indicators technique and the method of cluster and crigging averaging of raw materials quality are developed. ??????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????-???????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?????????????????? ????????????? ??? ??????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ???????, ??????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????????? ??????????, ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????, ?????????????? ??? ????????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ???????. ????????, ??? ??? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????? ????????????? ????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ?? ????????????? ?????????. ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ????? ??????????? ?????? ? ???????? ???????????, ????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ??????, ?????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????? ???????, ? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ??? ????????????? ????????????? ?????, ??? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ??????????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????. ???????????, ??? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ??????????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????, ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????, ???????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????? ????????????? ???????. ??????? ???????? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?? ?????????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????? ?????????????? ? ??????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?? ???????????????? ???????????? ?? ????????????? ??????????? ?????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????...|$|E
