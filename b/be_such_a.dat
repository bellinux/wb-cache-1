5|$|After the accident, {{souvenir}} hunters {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{problem that the}} owners of Berry Brow kept all gates locked. Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a bulldozer {{would be used to}} dig a ditch at the crash site and what remained of the Amana would be buried.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes readily hybridises with Banksia hookeriana (Hooker's banksia) under {{experimental}} conditions, {{indicating that}} these species have highly compatible pollen. The cultivar B.Waite Orange' {{is believed to}} <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> hybrid, having arisen by open pollination during a breeding experiment conducted at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute of the University of Adelaide in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Recipients {{consider}} the Golden Film {{to be an}} award given to films that are a success. Director Martin Koolhoven said, when Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, {{that he did not}} expect his film to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film. Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did not expect it to receive a Golden Film.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
5|$|Tory leaders {{scheduled}} a leadership convention for December. In early November, the Suez crisis erupted. Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded {{that it was better}} to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the {{albatrosses}} in the Northern Hemisphere is more complete {{than that of the}} southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of short-tailed albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda, and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa, Japan, actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds. For more data on fossil species of the living albatross genera, see the genus articles.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, {{the novel}} proved to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> happy success for Heinemann that they honoured it by {{choosing}} 'Sunlocks, London' as their telegraph address, {{in reference to}} one of the novel's main characters.

25|$|A large {{woodpecker}} was videotaped on 25 April 2004; its size, wing pattern at {{rest and}} in flight, and white plumage {{on its back}} between the wings were cited {{as evidence that the}} woodpecker sighted was an ivory-billed woodpecker.

25|$|Because JavaScript is {{the only}} {{language}} that the most popular browsers share support for, {{it has become a}} target language for many frameworks in other languages, even though JavaScript was never intended to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> language. Despite the performance limitations inherent to its dynamic nature, the increasing speed of JavaScript engines has made the language a surprisingly feasible compilation target.|$|E

Although VR did not publicly indicate the T was intended to replace the J class, it proved to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> successful design that further orders of this locomotive class were made during the late 1950s and 1960s, gradually displacing the J class from many of its normal duties.|$|E

25|$|The {{book was}} edited by Professor of Philosophy Alexander Wilder and {{published}} in two volumes by J.W. Bouton in 1877. Although facing negative mainstream press reviews, including from those who highlighted that it extensively quoted around 100 other books without acknowledgement, it proved to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> commercial success, with its initial print run of 1000 copies selling out in a week, that the publisher requested a sequel, although Blavatsky turned down the offer.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, {{the day of}} {{judgment}} happens every year on Rosh Hashanah; therefore, the belief in a last day {{of judgment}} for all mankind is disputed. Some rabbis hold that there will <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> day following {{the resurrection of the}} dead. Others hold that {{there is no need for}} that because of Rosh Hashanah. Yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Other rabbis hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentile nations and not the Jewish people.|$|E
25|$|I denie not {{but that}} ther may <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> king, who may regard {{the common good}} before his own, may have no vitious favourite, may hearken only to the wisest and incorruptest of his Parlament: but this rarely happ'ns in a monarchie not elective; and it behoves not a wise nation to committ the summ of thir well-being, the whole of thir safetie to fortune.

25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that {{informal}} logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing as informal logic. Massey criticizes informal logic {{on the grounds that}} it has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the invalidity of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860 Democratic National Convention at Charleston, South Carolina, Butler {{initially}} supported John C. Breckinridge for President, {{but then}} shifted his support to Jefferson Davis, believing {{that only a}} moderate Southerner could keep the Democratic party from dividing. A conversation he had with Davis prior to the convention convinced him that Davis might <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> man, and he gave him his support before the convention split over slavery. Butler ended up supporting Breckinridge over Douglas against state party instructions, ruining his standing with the state party apparatus. He was nominated for governor in the 1860 election by a Breckinridge splinter of the state party, but trailed far behind other candidates.|$|E
25|$|During {{his tenure}} Kolbe strived {{to reverse the}} trend of falling {{enrollment}} at Drexel, he accomplished that by instituting an Open House, allowing Philadelphia-area {{high school students and}} their parents to visit Drexel. This program proved to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success that it was temporarily discontinued in 1938, due to peak enrollment being reached. In this time, Kolbe took note of the school’s need to expand, and, with the budgetary assistance of an increasing enrollment and slight raise in tuition, set to work appealing for a separate building for the library, as well as additional student use buildings and campus ground, including an athletics field. In addition to these improvements to the Institute Kolbe was responsible for increased research and the display of the Drexel Institute's Collections.|$|E
