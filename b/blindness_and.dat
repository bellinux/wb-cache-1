5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, <b>blindness</b> <b>and</b> sensitization.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson's disease-like syndromes, cortical <b>blindness,</b> <b>and</b> a depressed mood. Depression may occur in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river <b>blindness,</b> <b>and</b> leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E

Despite Frank's worries that his wife will not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. The operation is a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child {{is so strong that}} she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her <b>blindness</b> <b>and</b> knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about his}} growing <b>blindness,</b> <b>and</b> not enjoying the social life in London, Bute retired to his estates on the Isle of Bute {{for the next}} six years. While recovering, Bute married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818. Maria was one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Guilford, and a wealthy heiress. £40,000 was settled on her {{at the time of her}} {{marriage}} and she was due to inherit a third of her father's extensive estates. Contemporaries considered Maria a kind and pleasant woman, but she was often unwell and the marriage proved childless. In 1820 his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn, and published two years later as an engraving by William Ward. In 1827 his father-in-law died and Maria inherited lands worth over £110,000.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, <b>blindness,</b> <b>and</b> developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow <b>blindness</b> <b>and,</b> eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a common}} systemic disease amongst Black South  Africans. It may lead to diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common cause of visual impairment (VI)   <b>and</b> <b>blindness.</b> DR may signifiantly increase the prevalence of VI <b>and</b> <b>blindness.</b> Aim: To assess risk factors for VI <b>and</b> <b>blindness</b> amongst a black diabetic South African  population aged ≥ 40 years. Setting: The {{study was conducted in}} seven Government healthcare facilities (two hospitals,  four clinics and one health centre) in Mopani District, Limpopo province, South Africa. Method s : This was a cross-sectional health facility-based quantitative study. Structured  interviews were used to obtain information, which included sociodemographic profie,  knowledge about DM and its ocular complications, presence of hypertension and accessibility  to health facilities. Subsequently participants were examined for VI <b>and</b> <b>blindness</b> using an  autorefractor, pinhole disc, ophthalmoscope and logMAR visual acuity chart. Anthropometric  measurements (height, weight and waist) were also taken. Associations between 31 risk factors  and VI as well as blindness were statistically examined. Results: Participants (N = 225) included 161 women and 64 men aged 40 – 90 years (mean 61. 5 ±  10. 49 years); 41. 3 % of them had VI and 3. 6 % were blind. Cataracts (76. 8 %) and DR (7. 1 %) were  the common causes of compensated VI <b>and</b> <b>blindness.</b> Risk factors that were associated with VI  <b>and</b> <b>blindness</b> were age, monthly income, compliance with losing weight and physical activity. Conclusion: Findings suggest that lifestyle intervention and appropriate eyecare programmes  may reduce VI <b>and</b> <b>blindness</b> in this population. </p...|$|R
