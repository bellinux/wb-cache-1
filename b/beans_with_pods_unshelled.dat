40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Germany, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from the company Nichino Europe Co Ltd. to modify the existing MRLs for fenpyroximate in various crops. In order to accommodate for the authorized uses in European Member States, the EMS Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs of fenpyroximate in peaches, raspberries, blackberries, peppers and <b>beans</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> and to lower MRLs for citrus fruit, loquat, quinces, medlar, plums, apricots, wine grapes and strawberries. No need to modify MRLs was identified for apples, pears, tomatoes and aubergines. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted residue data are sufficient to support the lowering of the existing EU MRLs for citrus fruit, pome fruit, plums, wine grapes and strawberries. The submitted residue data on raspberries, blackberries, peppers and <b>beans</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> substantiate the proposal to raise the existing EU MRL. The submitted residue data on peaches, tomatoes and aubergines confirm the existing EU MRL. For apricots insufficient data were provided to support the authorized use. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the raising of the existing EU MRLs for fenpyroximate in raspberries, blackberries, peppers and <b>beans</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> and the maintaining or lowering of the existing EU MRLs for other crops under consideration, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. Data gaps regarding the lack of processing studies and rotational crop studies identified by the peer review are confirmed in the current assessment and have to be further considered in the framework of the MRL review according to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005...|$|R

In order to accommodate the intended uses of acetamiprid, Greece proposed to raise the existing MRLs of acetamiprid from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in purslane, from 0. 01 * mg/kg in peas (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> and 0. 06 mg/kg in <b>beans</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> to 0. 5 mg/kg, from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 0. 05 mg/kg in beans (without pods) and from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg in pulses (dry beans and peas). Greece drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg on <b>beans</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods),</b> 0. 4 mg/kg on peas (<b>with</b> <b>pods),</b> 0. 07 mg/kg on beans (without pods), 0. 15 mg/kg on peas (without pods) and 0. 07 mg/kg on pulses (dry beans and peas); these MRL proposals reflect the intended uses in southern EU only. In addition, a MRL proposal for purslane (3 mg/kg) was derived by extrapolation from trials on lettuce. A deficiency was noted in some trials concerning the storage conditions of the samples prior analysis. Information needs to be provided to confirm that samples were effectively stored under conditions for which integrity of residues is demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of acetamiprid in the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg.

40|$|A {{centrifugal}} bambara {{groundnut sheller}} was designed, constructed and evaluated. The sheller {{consists of a}} feed hopper with a flow rate control device, shelling unit, separating unit and power system. Nine different impellers {{were used for the}} investigation at three different pod moisture contents. Results of the performance tests were examined using a 3 x 3 x 3 factorial design with moisture content, impeller slot angulations and number of impeller slots as variables. Results showed that moisture content, impeller slot angulations, number of impeller slots and interaction between these variables statistically affected the performance indicators (shelling efficiency, percentage of breakage, percentage of partially shelled <b>pods,</b> percentage of <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> and winnowing efficiency) at the significance level of 5 %. The forward facing impeller with eight slots gave the best performance of 96 % shelling efficiency, 3. 4 % breakage, 0. 6 % partially shelled <b>pods.</b> No <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> were recorded, and winnowing efficiency of 97. 3 % was recorded at an average feed rate of 215. 8 kg h- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} efficiency of the Papadakis method on the quality evaluation of experiments with multiple-harvest oleraceous crops, and on the estimate of the covariate and the ideal plot size. Data from nine uniformity trials (five <b>with</b> <b>bean</b> <b>pod,</b> two <b>with</b> zucchini, and two with sweet pepper) and from one experiment with treatments (with sweet pepper) were used. Through the uniformity trials, the best way to calculate the covariate was defined and the optimal plot size was calculated. In the experiment with treatments, analyses of variance and covariance were performed, in which the covariate was calculated by the Papadakis method, and experimental precision was evaluated based on four statistics. The use of analysis of covariance with the covariate obtained by the Papadakis method increases the quality of experiments with multiple-harvest oleraceous crops and allows the use of smaller plot sizes. The best covariate is the one that considers a neighboring plot of each side of the reference plot...|$|R
40|$|A {{market study}} was {{conducted}} in the Solomon Islands in 2009. The objectives were to understand the current diversity of vegetables and the total volume of vegetables traded in the country, determine the potential for new vegetable varieties, and identify major varieties and traits that market vendors prefer. Quantitative data were gathered in Guadalcanal Province (Honiara central market) and Malaita Province (Auki market), from mid-November to mid- December. Results showed an annual volume of 2, 631 metric tons sold in both markets valued at US$ 2. 83 million, much lower than the estimated production volume of 6, 506 metric tons in 2009. Although only about 20 % of the vendors sold new varieties in the past, nearly 40 % said that several vegetables with good market potential are currently missing in their areas. Reasons vary from production constraints (infertile soil, high incidence of insects, pests and diseases, excessive rain), lack of financial resources (high cost of production, high transportation cost, expensive seeds), no/poor access to resources (seeds, land, water), to seasonal availability (not available in the market when they want to sell it, insufficient quantities produced). The main vegetable varieties that vendors thought were better than the ones being sold and which they would be interested to try are: yardlong <b>bean</b> <b>with</b> green <b>pods</b> (79 %), cabbage with dark green leaves (73 %), and onion with white bulbs (50 %).

40|$|A b s t r a c t. One of {{the most}} tedious {{operations}} in processing bambara groundnut is the shelling operation. However, moisture content normally affects the handling and processing of agro-materials, such as nut shelling/cracking. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of moisture content on shelling efficiency of bambara groundnut using a centrifugal cracker. A 50 kg bag of bambara groundnut obtained from Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria, was divided into three groups. These groups were prepared for tests by soaking them in ordinary water at room temperature for different periods of 0, 60 and 90 min to obtain different levels of moisture content. Moisture content of each sample was determined by oven drying at 130 °C for 6 h. The moisture content levels were found to be 5. 3, 9. 6, and 12. 2 % (d. b.) for samples A, B and C, respectively. The samples were subjected to impact energy through a centrifugal impaction device operating at an angular velocity of 1920 r. p. m., using three different types of impellers. Data obtained on the percentage of fully shelled pods and unbroken seeds, fully shelled <b>pods</b> <b>with</b> broken seeds, partially shelled <b>pods</b> and <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> were statistically analysed. Results showed that both moisture content and impeller angula-tions {{have a significant effect on}} these performance indices.
