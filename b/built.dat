5|$|Numerous bridges {{have been}} <b>built</b> over Toby Creek. One was <b>built</b> in 1920 and {{repaired}} in 1989. Another was <b>built</b> in 1928 and repaired in 1963 {{and a third}} was <b>built</b> in 1939. Six bridges were <b>built</b> over the creek in 1941, {{all of them in}} Kingston Township or Dallas Township. Another bridge was <b>built</b> over Toby Creek in 1955 and four more were <b>built</b> in 1963, one of which was repaired in 1988. One was <b>built</b> in 1970 and repaired in 1980 and another was <b>built</b> in 1976 and repaired in 1997. Two more bridges were <b>built</b> across the creek in 1980, one more in 1984, and one in 1989.|$|E
5|$|A further block (also {{known as}} Annexe Market or Triangular Block) {{consisting}} of two separate structures (the Fish Market and the Red House) was <b>built</b> between 1886 and 1899. The Fish Market, <b>built</b> by John Mowlem & Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones' death. The Red House, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade, was <b>built</b> between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets Cold Storage Co. Ltd.. It {{was one of the}} first cold stores to be <b>built</b> outside the London docks and continued to serve Smithfield Market until the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|A {{road was}} <b>built</b> {{the same year}} on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, Bryce Canyon Lodge was <b>built</b> from local timber and stone.|$|E
5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that the platform was purposely <b>built</b> to support the three temples that were <b>built</b> more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was <b>built</b> first, then decommissioned with the platform being <b>built</b> to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|A two-seat {{conversion}} trainer, {{designated the}} I-5UTI (Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy Istrebitel—Fighter Trainer), was <b>built</b> {{by one of}} the factories. Only about twenty are believed to have been <b>built.</b> The cockpit was moved back and a second one inserted in front of it.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek {{is named}} after a {{historic}} Mohican chief of a village in the area. The creek's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure was <b>built</b> in the watershed in the 1970s. Numerous bridges have been <b>built</b> over the creek since 1925. The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed. A 500-million-gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake was <b>built</b> on the creek in 1965.|$|E
5|$|After {{the early}} 20th century, few fortifications were <b>built</b> in Malta. However, new {{military}} installations such as airfields {{began to be}} <b>built</b> in World War I, when the seaplane base of RAF Kalafrana and the airfield at Marsa were <b>built.</b> More airfields were <b>built</b> {{in the interwar period}} and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert Airfield.|$|E
5|$|Another {{series of}} towers were <b>built</b> between 1658 and 1659. Fourteen towers were <b>built</b> in all, which are {{together}} {{known as the}} De Redin towers. These {{were based on the}} Lascaris towers and had the same function as a communication link. 13 towers were <b>built</b> on mainland Malta having an identical design, and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins. The fourteenth tower, Mġarr ix-Xini Tower, was <b>built</b> on Gozo in 1661 with a slightly different design.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} knights' fortifications, {{over the years}} various {{individuals}} or families <b>built</b> their own fortifications. These were mainly fortified residences or private watchtowers. A notable surviving example is Mamo Tower, <b>built</b> in 1657 in Marsaskala.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main temple complex, there is a rest house <b>built</b> {{on the right side}} over the {{remaining}} part of the rocky ridge; this was <b>built</b> by the Maharaja of Guler, a neighboring state. The rest house is <b>built</b> in a blend of Hindu and Mughal architectural styles with features of arcades and small dome shaped structures.|$|E
5|$|At Second Avenue on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, a large {{open space}} was <b>built</b> above for the four-track IND Second Avenue Line. The Second Avenue Line will be <b>built</b> under this space, if a {{transfer}} station is ever <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|Auberge d'Italie was {{the third}} Italian auberge to be <b>built</b> in Malta. The first auberge was <b>built</b> in Birgu in the 1550s, {{on the site of}} an earlier {{building}} which had been used by the Langue of Italy. Following the transfer of the capital city from Birgu to Valletta, a second auberge was <b>built</b> in the centre of the new city in 1570–71. This building was eventually incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, and the present auberge began to be <b>built</b> in Strada San Giacomo (now Merchants Street). The original designs of both Valletta auberges were made by the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar.|$|E
5|$|Australia and New Zealand were <b>built</b> with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was <b>built</b> instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and {{direct access to the}} primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were <b>built</b> with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|Between 1958 and 1960, the station's chapel was <b>built</b> by Brandt O'Dell. The {{building}} {{incorporated a}} nave with seating space for 350 people, and connecting wings {{to the hall}} and narthex. In 1962, the gymnasium was <b>built</b> on the site.|$|E
5|$|<b>Built</b> around 1700, Plumbtree Farmhouse off Ward's Lane in Bradwall Green is a two-storey {{building}} with three windows, <b>built</b> with brown brick.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, {{thirteen}} German light cruisers {{had been}} lost in the course of World War I. To replace them, the Kaiserliche Marine ordered ten new cruisers <b>built</b> to a modified Königsberg class design. All ten ships were laid down in 1915 and 1916. Cöln was <b>built</b> by the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Bremen. Wiesbaden and Rostock were <b>built</b> at AG Vulcan in Stettin, and Leipzig, Ersatz Cöln, and Ersatz Emden were ordered from the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen. Dresden and Magdeburg were <b>built</b> at the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, while Frauenlob and Ersatz Karlsruhe were <b>built</b> by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel.|$|E
5|$|Churches include Christ the King (Roman Catholic), <b>built</b> in 1952; Destiny Knowles Pentecostal Church (Pentecostal); St Barnabas (Church of England), <b>built</b> in 1938; Holy Cross (Church of God of Prophecy); and the Salvation Army.|$|E
5|$|Dunball wharf was <b>built</b> in 1844 by Bridgwater coal merchants, and {{was linked}} to the Bristol and Exeter Railway by a rail track which crossed the A38. The link was <b>built</b> in 1876, also by coal merchants, and was {{originally}} operated as a horse-drawn tramway. In 1875, the local landowner <b>built</b> The Dunball Steam Pottery & Brick & Tile Works adjacent to the wharf.|$|E
5|$|During 1939–1940, some 475 Dornier Do 17Z bombers, 16 {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and nine night fighters were <b>built.</b> Another 100 Dornier Do 215s, an updated {{variant of the}} Do 17, were <b>built</b> during this period also.|$|E
5|$|Early {{roads in}} the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} include Boone Road, which was <b>built</b> in 1779 to aid in combat against the Six Nations and the Jersey Shore Road, which was <b>built</b> some time before 1833. The Jersey Shore Road was later renamed the Cloudersport and Jersey Shore Turnpike. Another road was <b>built</b> in 1834 in the watershed, followed by another road several years later that ran between the West Branch Susquehanna River and Cross Fork. Butler Road was <b>built</b> {{on the western side}} of the watershed in 1850. The first post office in the watershed was established at Westport in 1847. The first bridge to cross the creek was <b>built</b> in 1852 at Westport.|$|E
5|$|First prototype; one <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel was <b>built</b> on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as {{to protect}} Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be <b>built</b> with the bastioned trace in Malta. The Order's last major {{fortification}} in the harbour area was Fort Tigné, <b>built</b> at Tigné Point between 1793 and 1795. It was <b>built</b> to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture {{is very different from}} the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort. Many other polygonal forts were <b>built</b> by the British later on in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Gaunless Bridge, an iron railway bridge, <b>built</b> by Stephenson in 1823, and {{the first}} iron bridge to be <b>built</b> for a railway, rather than a tramway.|$|E
5|$|Herrick's mansion, Greyfriars House, {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} his family until his great-grandson Samuel sold it in 1711. The property was subsequently divided and sold in 1740; three years later, New Street was <b>built</b> across {{the western part of the}} site. Many burials were discovered when houses were laid out along the street. A townhouse, 17 Friar Lane, was <b>built</b> on the eastern part of the site in 1759 and survives today. During the 19th century, the site became increasingly <b>built</b> on. In 1863 Alderman Newton's Boys' School <b>built</b> a schoolhouse on part of the site. Herrick's mansion was demolished in 1871, the present Grey Friars Street was laid through the site in 1873, and more commercial developments, including the Leicester Trustee Savings Bank, were <b>built.</b> In 1915 the rest of the site was acquired by Leicestershire County Council which <b>built</b> offices on it in the 1920s and 1930s. The county council relocated in 1965 when its new County Hall opened, and Leicester City Council moved in. The rest of the site, where Herrick's garden had once been, was turned into a staff car park in about 1944, but was not otherwise <b>built</b> on.|$|E
5|$|INS Shivalik (F47) is {{the lead}} ship of her class of stealth {{multi-role}} frigates <b>built</b> for the Indian Navy. She is the first stealth warship <b>built</b> by India. She was <b>built</b> at the Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) located in Mumbai. Construction of the vessel began in 2001 and was completed by 2009. She underwent sea trials from thereon before being commissioned on 29 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1699 Edward Strode <b>built</b> almshouses, {{close to}} the rectory his family had <b>built</b> to house the town's grammar school, which lasted until 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery, an outwork of Fort Manoel, was <b>built</b> on the {{northern}} shore of the peninsula. A bastioned entrenchment was proposed in the early 1760s, {{but it was never}} <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1803, {{construction}} was begun of Inchkeith Lighthouse, designed and <b>built</b> by Thomas Smith and Robert Stevenson. The lighthouse stands 67 metres high and was operational by 1804. The Fidra light was <b>built</b> in 1885 and automated in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, a forge was <b>built</b> on Catawissa Creek {{for making}} bar iron. By the late 1820s, there were {{plans to build}} a {{railroad}} paralleling Catawissa Creek and connecting Catawissa with Pottsville. The Catawissa Railroad, which was <b>built</b> in the 1830s, paralleled Catawissa Creek for part of its course. Another railroad that historically paralleled Catawissa Creek was the Danville, Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre Railroad, which was <b>built</b> in 1870. A paper mill was established on Catawissa Creek in Catawissa in 1811. In the late 19th century a dam was <b>built</b> on Catawissa Creek in Beaver Township.|$|E
5|$|In Acre, Zahir {{rebuilt the}} Crusader-era walls and <b>built</b> {{on top of}} various Crusader and Mamluk {{structures}} in the city. Among these were the caravanserais of Khan al-Shawarda and its Burj al-Sultan tower and Khan al-Shunah. In 1758, he commissioned {{the construction of the}} al-Muallaq Mosque, He also <b>built</b> the Seraya government house in Nazareth, which served as that city's municipal headquarters until 1991. In Haifa, which Zahir founded, he <b>built</b> a wall with four towers and two gates around the new settlement. Within Haifa, he <b>built</b> the Burj al-Salam fortress, a small mosque, a customs building, and a government residence (saraya). In Tiberias, he commissioned the building of a citadel (now ruined) and the al-Amari Mosque. The latter was <b>built</b> with alternating white and black stone, typical of the architectural style of Zahir's building works, and a minaret.|$|E
5|$|In Autumn 2011 {{construction}} began of a Tesco Extra 24-hour store. The glass fronted 120,000 sq ft {{store has}} been <b>built</b> {{on the old}} B site next to Ashley Way and was opened in March 2012. The store was <b>built</b> on stilts allowing a car park to be <b>built</b> underneath the store for around 600 cars.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to what was}} <b>built,</b> the original plans also called for a multi-story parking garage, a 550-seat conventional movie theatre, and a direct underground link to the Museum subway stop. These features were deemed too costly and were never <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, the British <b>built</b> Fort Verdala and St. Clement's Retrenchment in the Cottonera area, while Lascaris Battery was <b>built</b> in Valletta. Later {{on in the}} 19th century, {{parts of}} the Cottonera Lines, Santa Margherita Lines and the fortifications of Senglea were {{demolished}} {{to make way for}} extensions of the Malta Dockyard. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the British <b>built</b> barracks {{in various parts of the}} island, such as Tigné Point and Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Constitution Gardens was <b>built</b> on {{the former}} site of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was <b>built</b> nearby in the early 1980s.|$|E
