5|$|At {{the west}} end of the {{platforms}} are the offices and dispatch tower for the IRT Flushing Line. Train crews report to the offices, while the dispatch tower dispatches trains and controls the Flushing Line. West of the station, the line rises from the tunnel via a portal at College Point Boulevard, and onto the elevated <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Flushing Creek.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{considered}} {{building a}} <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Rampart Gorge {{as part of}} a project to extend the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to Nome to facilitate Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union during World War II. The war ended before the project got beyond the planning stages, and the bridge idea was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The public {{transport}} network is well {{developed in the}} city: There are both bus and trolleybus lines. The city has four big automobile bridges: two automobile <b>bridges</b> <b>across</b> the Vologda River and two <b>bridges</b> <b>across</b> railways. There is one pedestrian bridge (the Red bridge) in the city center.|$|R

5|$|The 1964 Lexington <b>Bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Mississippi River was {{replaced}} by a new bridge, built from 2001 to 2004, due to deterioration of the old structure including cracks in steel beams. Unweave the Weave, a project to eliminate weaving at the I-694 overlap, was completed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department {{designated}} M-189 {{as a state}} trunkline {{highway in}} late 1932 or early 1933. During {{the latter half of}} 1936, the department paved the highway in its entirety. The route has remained the same since. The current <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Brule River was built in 1988.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} route connecting Laurel and Fort Meade was MD 216. That highway {{was built}} between 1934 and 1939 along a course generally north of modern MD 198. Modern MD 198 was constructed as MD 602 {{as a military}} access project during World War II. The first segment of the new highway, from US 1 to MD 216 near Brock Bridge Road {{in what is now}} Maryland City, was started in 1943 and completed in 1944. This segment included a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) in Laurel and a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Patuxent River. The remainder of MD 602, from near Brock Bridge Road to the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River, was completed by 1946. When MD 602 was completed, MD 216 was truncated at US 1.|$|E
5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|A new Methodist {{church was}} built in the {{community}} in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing. Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden trestle part of the railroad <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Willamette caught fire and burned. Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what was then the Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.|$|E

5|$|An {{automobile}} <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Ebey Slough and the Snohomish River estuary to Everett {{was completed}} in 1927, with funding {{from the state department}} of highways to complete the Pacific Highway (later part of U.S. Route 99, and present-day State Route 529). The city remained relatively unchanged through the Great Depression, with the diversity of industries credited for Marysville avoiding the worst of economic hardship experienced by other nearby communities. During World War II, an ammunition depot was built on the Tulalip Reservation near present-day Quil Ceda, later being re-used as a Boeing test site after the aerospace company expanded in Everett.|$|E
5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the {{through station}} was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.|$|E
5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received {{an improvement in}} 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{the newly}} created National Capital Development Commission (NCDC), which had been created and given more power by Menzies {{following}} a 1955 Senate inquiry, restored the West Lake to its plans, and it was formally gazetted in October 1959. The NCDC also blocked a plan by the Department of Works to build a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the lake along the land axis between Parliament House and the War Memorial contrary to Griffin's plans.|$|E

5|$|In Lake Worth, 600homes were {{destroyed}} and 1,500other dwellings were damaged, leaving about 700people homeless. Approximately 50businesses were wrecked and 200others received damage â€“ roughly 75% of {{buildings in the}} business district. Several additional buildings were demolished, including city hall, St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Church. The Oakley Theater was nearly destroyed, with the roof and walls crushed. Other severely damaged buildings included the Masonic Temple, a hotel, and the auditorium of Lake Worth Community High School. The <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Intracoastal Waterway collapsed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{said that}} this is the place from where the Hindu god Rama built a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the sea to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from her {{abductor}} Ravana. The Ramanathaswamy Temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, is located at the centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama. The temple, along with the town, is considered a holy pilgrimage site for both Shaivas and Vaishnavas.|$|E
5|$|Members of Task Force Manchu {{who escaped}} from Hill 209 brought back {{considerable}} intelligence information of North Korean {{activity in the}} vicinity of the Paekchin ferry crossing site. At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge. A short distance downstream, each night they placed a pontoon <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.|$|E
