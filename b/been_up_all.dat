I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
500|$|... "The Coon" [...] is {{primarily}} a parody of dark-toned comic book movies. The Dark Knight (2008), The Spirit (2008) and Watchmen (2009) are the most commonly referred to films, but others such as Spider-Man 3 (2007) are also frequently referenced. Matt Stone said the episode started as a parody specifically of Watchmen, but then elements of other comic book films were added as the writing progressed. The music used in [...] "The Coon" [...] is inspired by the style of film scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, both of whom collaborated on the scores for Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight. To promote the Coon, Cartman uses a similar tagline as was used to promote Darkman, printing shirts asking [...] "Who is The Coon?" [...] The Coon and Mysterion use deep and ominous voices {{similar to that used}} by Christian Bale in the Batman films and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach in Watchmen. Stone said he found Bale's voice particularly annoying in The Dark Knight, and found it amusing that so many comic book movies had heroes whose voices were so low, it sounded like they were [...] "whispering, like you've <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> night smoking".|$|E
500|$|In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who {{had been}} {{overseeing}} the Paris installation, was {{brought back to the}} US to manage [...] the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States. He began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 [...] "field engineers" [...] struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder, Thomas Alva Edison, only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison who made a quip about their [...] "Parisian" [...] being out all night. After Tesla told them he had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> night fixing the Oregon Edison commented to Batchelor that [...] "this is a damned good man." [...] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp–based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.|$|E
