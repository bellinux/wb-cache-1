Dr. Fischer claimed that {{the health of the}} empress would not permit another pregnancy, and she would regularly have to go to Kissingen for a cure. Elisabeth fell into her old pattern of escaping boredom and dull court protocol through frequent walking and riding, using her health as an excuse to avoid both official obligations and sexual intimacy. Her successful avoidance of further pregnancies would have been a natural reaction to having been assigned the role of an imperial <b>brood</b> <b>mare,</b> bearing a child a year only to have it taken away from her, but the importance of preserving her youthful appearance was an important influence in her decision: [...] "Children are the curse of a woman, for when they come, they drive away Beauty, which is the best gift of the gods".|$|E

Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express.

No nursery work for her, thanks.|$|E

40|$|A disease {{outbreak}} investigation {{was conducted in}} western Queensland to investigate a rare suspected outbreak of pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) toxicosis in horses. Thirty five of 132 horses depastured on five properties on the Mitchell grass plains of western Queensland died {{in the first six}} months of 2010. Clinical–pathological findings were consistent with PA toxicosis. A local variety of Crotalaria medicaginea was the only hepatotoxic plant found growing on affected properties. Pathology reports and departure and arrival dates of two <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> provided evidence of a pre wet season exposure period. All five affected properties experienced a very dry spring and early summer preceded by a large summer wet season. The outbreak was characterised as a point epidemic with a sudden peak of deaths in March followed by mortalities steadily declining until the end of June. The estimated morbidity (serum IGG > 50 IU/L) rate was 76 %. Average crude mortality was 27 % but higher in young horses (67 %) and <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> (44 %). Logistic regression analysis showed that young horses and <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> and those grazing denuded pastures in December were most strongly associated with dying whereas those fed hay and/or grain based supplements were less likely to die. This is the first detailed study of an outbreak of PA toxicosis in central western Queensland and the first to provide evidence that environmental determinants were associated with mortality, that the critical exposure period was towards the end of the dry season, that supplementary feeding is protective and that denuded pastures and the horses physiological protein requirement are risk factors...|$|R
