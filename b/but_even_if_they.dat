5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do, their manes will be only around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E

He had not been publicly seen since 1963, and when {{his wife and two}} grown sons came out from hiding in 1992, many then suspected that Provenzano was dead, from natural causes or otherwise. Informants subsequently claimed otherwise, saying that after Riina's arrest in 1993, Provenzano became the boss of the Corleonesi.

2500|$|A 2016 study {{argues that}} the denuclearization of Ukraine was not a [...] "stupid mistake" [...] {{and that it is}} unclear that Ukraine would be better off as a nuclear state. The study {{argues that the}} push for Ukrainian {{independence}} was with a view to make it a nonnuclear state. The United States would also not have made Ukraine an exception {{when it came to the}} denuclearization of other post-Soviet states such as Belarus and Kazakhstan. The deterrent value of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine was also questionable, as Ukraine would have had to spend 12 to 18 months to establish full operational control over the nuclear arsenal left by the Russians. The ICBMs also had a range of 5.000-10.000km (initially targeting the United States), which meant that they could only have been re-targeted to hit Russia's far east. The air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) left by the Russians had been disabled by the Russians during the collapse of the Soviet Union, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been reconfigured and made to work by the Ukrainians, it is unlikely that they would have had a deterrent effect. Had Ukraine decided to establish full operational control of the nuclear weapons, it would have faced sanctions by the West and perhaps even a withdrawal of diplomatic recognition by the United States and other NATO allies. Ukraine would also likely have faced retaliatory action by Russia. Ukraine would also have struggled with replacing the nuclear weapons once their service life expired, as Ukraine did not have a nuclear weapons program. In exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons, Ukraine received financial compensation, as well as the security guarantees of the Budapest Memorandum.|$|E

Although, the evolutionary techniques for multiobjective optimization confront with several issues as: elitism, diversity of the population, or efficient settings for the specific parameters of the algorithm.

Therefore, the members of the population aren’t called chromosomes anymore, <b>but</b> hormones and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> evolve according to the genetic principles, a supplementary mechanism based on the endocrine paradigm is connected with standard approach to deal with multiobjective optimization problems. Moreover, the proposed algorithm, {{in order to maintain the}} diversity of the population, uses a specific scheme of fitness sharing, eliminating the inconvenient of defining an appropriate value of sharing factor. ...|$|R
