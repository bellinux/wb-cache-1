5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than a degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of dolmens from {{this portion of}} the subcontinent shows inhabitation as early as the Stone Age. The first prominent rulers of {{the northern part of the}} future Presidency were the Tamil Pandya dynasty (230 BCAD 102). Following the decline of the Pandyas and the Cholas, the country was conquered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> known race of people called the Kalabhras. The country recovered under the subsequent Pallava dynasty and its civilisation attained a peak when the later Telugu kings started acquiring vast places in Tamil Nadu. Following the conquest of Madurai by Malik Kafur in 1311, there was a brief lull when both culture and civilisation began to deteriorate. The Tamil and Telugu territories recovered under the Vijayanagar Empire, founded in 1336. Following the empire's demise, the country was split amongst numerous sultans, polygars and European trading companies. Between 1685 and 1947, a number of kings ruled the areas that became part of the Madras Presidency.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E

25|$|Democrat Lyndon Johnson, in 1964, {{lost the}} state by less than 5,000 votes to Arizona Senator and native Barry Goldwater. (This was the most closely contested state in what was {{otherwise}} a landslide victory for Johnson that year.) Democrat Bill Clinton ended this streak in 1996, when he won Arizona <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over two percentage points (Clinton had previously come within less than two percent of winning Arizona's electoral votes in 1992). Since then, {{the majority of the}} state has continued to support Republican presidential candidates by solid margins.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{an annual}} cycle, with sea {{temperature}} varying <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less than 4°C (7°F) over the year, peaking at nearly 24°C (75°F) in March, and falling to around 20°C (68°F) in September. This variability is much less than in nearby coastal waters, which reaches a similar peak in summer but drops as low as 18°C (64°F) in winter. The relatively low variability in sea temperatures at the Abrolhos is largely attributable to the Leeuwin Current, which bathes the islands in warm tropical water during winter months.|$|E

However, the craft exceeded its expected operational lifetime <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over {{two months before}} succumbing to the increasing cold and dark of an advancing Martian winter. Researchers had hoped that the lander would survive into the Martian winter {{so that it could}} witness polar ice developing around it – perhaps up to 1 metre of solid carbon dioxide ice could have appeared. Even had it survived some of the winter, the intense cold would have prevented it from lasting all the way through.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the funeral, Union {{headquarters}} ordered no spoken or sung words at the memorial service, and that only Dodd's relatives in Union-held territory (two aunts and their husbands) {{would be allowed to}} attend. The town was tense; a riot was possible and there was fear that a Confederate raid would take advantage of the situation. Security around Gen. Steele's headquarters was increased; no one was allowed to see him except on official business. Calm prevailed, and David O. Dodd was buried in plot Elm 355 in the southeast portion of Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, in a grave donated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Rock resident. This cemetery was also the eventual resting place of R.L. Dodge and Gen. Fagan.|$|E
25|$|After a {{long period}} of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia {{decreased}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over 3% on a yearly basis in the 3rd quarter of 2008. In the 4th quarter of 2008 the negative growth was already −9.4%. Some international experts and journalists, who like to view the three Baltic states as a single economic identity, have failed to notice that Estonia has constantly performed better than Lithuania and Latvia on many fundamental indicators. Still, in 2009 Estonia was one of the five worst performing economies in {{the world in terms of}} annual GDP growth rate. The current account deficit and inflation is lower than in Latvia, the GDP per capita is higher than in Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia's public debt is a very low 3.8% of GDP and government reserves are close to 10% of GDP. The difference is exemplified by the fact that in December 2008 Estonia became one of the donor countries to the IMF lead rescue package for Latvia.|$|E

25|$|Now Montrose {{found himself}} {{apparently}} master of Scotland. After Kilsyth, the king's secretary arrived with letters from Charles documenting that Montrose was lieutenant and captain general. He first conferred knighthood on Alasdair. Then he summoned a parliament {{to meet at}} Glasgow on 20 October, in which he no doubt hoped to reconcile loyal obedience to the King {{with the establishment of}} a non-political Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. Charles had been defeated at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June, and Montrose had to come to his aid if there was to be still a king to proclaim. David Leslie, the best of the Scottish generals, was promptly dispatched against Montrose to anticipate the invasion. On 12 September he came upon Montrose, who had been deserted by his Highlanders and was guarded only <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> group of followers, at Philiphaugh. He won an easy victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to organise an army. In September 1646 he embarked for Norway.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, Michaels took a hiatus from WWE {{after losing}} to The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV. Meanwhile, Triple H was embroiled in a rivalry with Randy Orton and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase). The feud {{continued}} from the spring through the summer with Triple H mainly combating with Orton over the WWE Championship. Eventually, Triple H would begin to target The Legacy because they were responsible for his losses against Orton during matches. After losing a handicap match to The Legacy, Triple H stated that he would search for Michaels in order to reunite DX. On the August 10, 2009 episode of Raw, video segments aired in which Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where he {{was working as a}} chef; throughout the segments, Triple H would try to convince Michaels return to WWE from hiatus. After several incidents during the segments (including a grease fire and Shawn getting shouted at <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy at SummerSlam, superkicking the girl, and quitting from his chef job in the process.|$|E
25|$|Emmet {{finds himself}} in the human world as a Lego minifigure unable to move. The events of the story are being played out <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy named Finn on his father's {{expansive}} Lego set in their basement. His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes {{home from work and}} chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and has the power to change everything. Finn reconciles with his father, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and begins a relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.|$|E
