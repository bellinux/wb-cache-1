5|$|She was not {{the first}} woman balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde had taken a trip on a {{tethered}} balloon in Paris. Neither was she the first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, Citoyenne Henri, who had made an ascent with André-Jacques Garnerin in 1798, was widely credited with that <b>ballooning</b> first, although the honour actually belonged to Elizabeth Thible. Thible, an opera singer, had made an ascent to entertain Gustav III of Sweden in Lyon on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt <b>ballooning</b> as a career.|$|E
5|$|Both OHSU and {{the city}} of Portland have taken much public {{criticism}} for <b>ballooning</b> development costs. Local television station KATU questioned the relative price of the Portland tram compared to a new tram at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, which was built by the same company, and (as of 2007) was projected to carry 28 percent more passengers three and a half times the distance and eight times the height, but costing only $25million.|$|E

50|$|<b>Balloon</b> {{modelling}} or <b>balloon</b> twisting is {{the shaping}} of special modelling <b>balloons</b> into almost any given shape, often a <b>balloon</b> animal. People who create <b>balloon</b> animals and other twisted <b>balloon</b> sculptures are called Twisters, <b>Balloon</b> Benders and <b>Balloon</b> Artists. Twisters often perform in restaurants, at birthday parties, fairs and at public and private events or functions.|$|R
40|$|Aortic wall tears {{resulting}} from rupture of dilating <b>balloons</b> in infants undergoing transluminal <b>balloon</b> angioplasty {{have not been}} previously recognized. A 2 day old infant had percutaneous transluminal <b>balloon</b> angioplasty to dilate a stenotic aortic valve, and after multiple <b>balloon</b> inflations the <b>balloon</b> burst. The infant died 2 days after undergoing transluminal <b>balloon</b> angioplasty and at necropsy a circumferential, transverse aortic wall tear was found. To test the hypothesis that rupture of appropriately sized <b>balloons</b> results in similar aortic wall tears, six unfixed, intact infant aortas were subjected to transluminal <b>balloon</b> angioplasty at necropsy: two infants had <b>balloon</b> rupture with inflated <b>balloon</b> diameter {{similar to that of}} the aorta, two had <b>balloon</b> rupture with an undersized <b>balloon</b> and two had dilation with an oversized <b>balloon.</b> Transverse wall tears occurred in aortas with similar aortic and <b>balloon</b> diameters; no aortic wall damage occurred with rupture of undersized <b>balloons,</b> and aortic rupture resulted from the use of oversized <b>balloons.</b> Thus, intimal-medial tears in the infant aorta may result from <b>balloon</b> bursting during angioplasty when aortic and inflated <b>balloon</b> diameters are similar...|$|R
5|$|In {{post-production}}, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater. Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already <b>ballooning</b> costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did the same with the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ballooning</b> was a risky {{business}} for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, {{she became the first}} woman to be killed in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she fell to her death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{manufacturer}} {{of hot air}} <b>balloons</b> {{in the world is}} Cameron <b>Balloons</b> company of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand <b>Balloons</b> of Oswestry, England. Cameron <b>Balloons,</b> Lindstrand <b>Balloons</b> and another English <b>balloon</b> manufacturing company, Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped <b>balloons.</b> These hot air <b>balloons</b> use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped <b>balloons</b> but often sections of the special <b>balloon</b> envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.|$|R

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before <b>ballooning</b> up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{he settled}} {{with his family}} at Bramdean House in Alresford, and was {{appointed}} Commander of the Balloon Sections, based at Aldershot {{under the command of}} Col James Templer. In 1906, having briefly become the Balloon Companies, the organisation became the School of <b>Ballooning</b> with Capper as its Commandant. At about the same time the Balloon Factory was split off and moved to a new site nearby at Farnborough and, on Templer's retirement, Capper also became its Superintendent and was given the brevet rank of full colonel. Templer was retained at the factory under Capper to complete the development Britain's first military airship, the Nulli Secundus ("second to none") in a purpose-built airship shed.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas <b>ballooning.</b> The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Balloon</b> {{artists are}} entertainers who twist and tie {{inflated}} tubular <b>balloons</b> into sculptures (see <b>balloon</b> modelling). The <b>balloons</b> used for sculpture {{are made of}} extra-stretchy rubber {{so that they can}} be twisted and tied without bursting. Since the pressure required to inflate a <b>balloon</b> is inversely proportional to the diameter of the <b>balloon,</b> these tiny tubular <b>balloons</b> are extremely hard to inflate initially. A pump is usually used to inflate these <b>balloons.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>balloons</b> most {{commonly}} used by NGOs are unconventional transparent 12-meter long cylindrical helium- or hydrogen-filled <b>balloons.</b> Sturdy double-walled greenhouse plastic {{is used for the}} <b>balloons.</b> The <b>balloons</b> include propaganda messages written on the surface in Korean script. These <b>balloons</b> were developed to replace blimps previously used by the South Korean government, which were no longer being produced. After the <b>balloons</b> travel far enough across the border, a timer opens the plastic bags carried by the <b>balloons.</b> The <b>balloons</b> can travel up to 200kilometers, and the maximum load for each <b>balloon</b> is 10kilograms. Fighters for a Free North Korea spends approximately 500 U.S. dollars for each <b>balloon</b> launched; however, the <b>balloons</b> are considered a low-cost solution.|$|R
50|$|<b>Balloons</b> {{are often}} {{deliberately}} released, creating a so-called <b>balloon</b> rocket. <b>Balloon</b> rockets work because the elastic <b>balloons</b> contract {{on the air}} within them, and so when {{the mouth of the}} <b>balloon</b> is opened, the gas within the <b>balloon</b> is expelled out, and due to Newton's third law of motion, the <b>balloon</b> is propelled forward. This is the same way that a rocket works.|$|R
5|$|Myers {{resigned}} from the bank in 1867 and moved to Hornellsville, New York. There he bought a photography gallery and ran the business for several years. Myers met Mary Hawley in Hornellsville and married her on November 8, 1871. She was 7 years younger, being born in 1849. In 1873 Myers took up an interest in making hydrogen gas and <b>ballooning.</b> The couple moved back to Mohawk from Hornellsville in 1875 and began activities of balloon manufacturing and flying. Mary became his lab assistant and later a balloon pilot known as Carlotta, the Lady Aeronaut.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} parachutes {{as her husband}} had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, {{and as part of}} her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in <b>ballooning.</b>|$|E
5|$|The initial budget, at {{approximately}} $140 million, led Evan Almighty {{to become the}} most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million. The <b>ballooning</b> budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area.|$|E

5|$|During the 1904 World's Fair, <b>ballooning</b> was {{demonstrated}} {{as a viable}} means of transportation; in October 1907, the second Gordon Bennett Cup, an international balloon racing event, {{was held in the}} city. The first airplane flight occurred in late 1909, and by the next year, an airfield had been established in nearby Kinloch, Missouri. In October 1910, St. Louis hosted President Theodore Roosevelt, who became the first president to fly in an airplane after departing from the field. In 1925, local entrepreneur Albert Lambert purchased Kinloch Field, expanded its facilities, and renamed it Lambert Field. In May 1927, Charles Lindbergh departed from Lambert Field en route to New York to begin his solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. In early 1928, the city of St. Louis purchased the airport from Lambert, making it the first municipally owned airport in the United States; Lambert remains the area's primary airport.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light and {{climb to the top}} of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as <b>ballooning</b> or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E

5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the <b>ballooning</b> tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses.

5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish <b>Ballooning</b> Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
