5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, {{believed to be}} financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E
5|$|At a May Day rally, held on Sunday 6 May in Eastville, local Trades Council members {{publicly}} criticised the TGWU. On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, {{but there was a}} poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation. The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk {{went on to win the}} election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} used by Jackson, {{combined with the}} reports coming out of South Carolina, raised the spectre of military confrontation for many on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> A group of Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction of the tariff.|$|E
25|$|Moderns {{may be able}} to see <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> however, as an {{historian}} might. Indeed, there exists a great difference in context between, say, an American, and a Germ{{an historian}} of the 1850s, where during 1848 citizens had made a rather spontaneous, incoherent effort to move German politics toward a free and unified country: it was crushed by the nobility.|$|E

25|$|Writers in the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{have taken}} positions on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of whether Kolob {{is a star}} or a planet. Brigham Young, second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), spoke of Kolob as a planet. Likewise, LDS Church apostles John Taylor, Orson Pratt (a mathematician {{with an interest in}} astronomy), Orson F. Whitney, and Alvin R. Dyer referred to Kolob as a planet. Other Mormon theologians have also viewed Kolob as a planet. Several other Mormon writers have referred to Kolob as a star, including B. H. Roberts and LDS Church president David O. McKay.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Nelson {{introduced}} a bill – the Upper Country bill – that gave SP added incentives {{in the form of}} land to complete the line, but also imposed a deadline after which the rights to build the railroad were forfeited, presumably in favor of Northern Pacific, whose plans would bypass Alexandria. The bill met with controversy from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and was ultimately amended to the point that Nelson first sought to table it, and then abstained from voting on it. The bill was enacted and was considered a success in its time, with most of the credit going to Nelson.|$|E

25|$|The school's mascot is an Indian. In 2004, {{there was}} a major {{controversy}} at the school about the appropriateness of the mascot. The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force {{was the right thing to}} do. After months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} and well-known pro-UN organizations, UNA-USA has been on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> In 2003, UNA-USA's executive director of policy studies, Jeffrey Laurenti, wrote an article, An Idea Whose Time Has Not Come, arguing that there were important unresolved issues of inclusivity, authority, and efficiency with the UNPA. UNA's position seemed to reverse in November 2006, when the 38th plenary session of the World Federation of United Nations Associations issued a resolution stating that it [...] "Supports the establishment of a United Nations parliamentary Assembly as a consultative body within the United Nations system as a voice of the citizens; Calls upon the governments of the United Nations member states, parliamentarians and civil society representatives to jointly examine possible steps and options to create a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> hired law firms, lobbyists, and {{business}} associates {{to promote their}} positions to city and state officials. A report by the Center City District said if both One Pennsylvania Plaza and the Cira Centre, another skyscraper in the KOZ controversy, were filled by corporations moving from other Center City office towers, the city could lose US$153 million by 2018. A report released by the group of building owners opposed to KOZ says the two buildings could cost the city almost US$91 million a year. In contrast, a report issued by a consulting company hired by Liberty Property Trust said that a KOZ designation for the skyscraper could generate US$27 million for the city. Critics of the KOZ designation also claimed that close relationships between Liberty Property Trust and Comcast and the Rendell administration were inappropriately influencing the governor's position on the issue. When Rendell was mayor of Philadelphia, David L. Cohen, a Comcast executive vice president, was Rendell's chief of staff, and William P. Hankowsky, Liberty Property Trust's chief executive, was director of Philadelphia's development agency. Rendell dismissed the claims, saying [...] "Every building owner in town was a contributor to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Jean {{has stated}} that he [...] "does not know enough" [...] to say whether he approves of the {{legislation}} of medicinal marijuana, but none of The Simpsons writers use the drug. [...] "It's {{one of the most}} sober writing staffs I've ever encountered", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. [...] "The stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize something and then criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states", Jean said. He continued, [...] "It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [...] makes." [...] The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies [...] "American corporations should stop playing god with nature." [...] She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of The Simpsons writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. [...] "Very often we take these stands on the show that we do not believe in at all", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.|$|E
