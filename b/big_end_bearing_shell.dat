5000|$|When {{building}} a high-performance engine, great {{attention is paid}} to the connecting rods, eliminating stress risers by such techniques as grinding the edges of the rod to a smooth radius, shot peening to induce compressive surface stresses (to prevent crack initiation), balancing all connecting rod/piston assemblies to the same weight and Magnafluxing to reveal otherwise invisible small cracks which would cause the rod to fail under stress. In addition, great care is taken to torque the connecting rod bolts to the exact value specified; often these bolts must be replaced rather than reused. The big end of the rod is fabricated as a unit and cut or cracked in two to establish precision fit around the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>shell.</b> Therefore, the big end [...] "caps" [...] are not interchangeable between connecting rods, and when re{{building a}}n engine, care must be taken to ensure that the caps of the different connecting rods are not mixed up. Both the connecting rod and its bearing cap are usually embossed with the corresponding position number in the engine block.|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{connecting}} rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing,</b> stress analysis, multi-body dynamics Abstract: In this paper, the multi-body dynamics software EXCITE {{was used to}} simulate the {{connecting rod}} <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> of two-stroke marine diesel engine. The result showed the stress analysis of connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b> The purpose {{is to provide a}} theoretical basis for the actual conditions of connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing,</b> and to improve the design of the crankshaft structure...|$|R
50|$|<b>Big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{commonly}} bushings or plain bearings, but less commonly may be roller bearings (see crankshaft).|$|R
5000|$|If a {{crankpin}} serves {{more than}} one cylinder, then the corresponding cylinders may have an offset, to simplify {{the design of the}} <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b> This design is used in: ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, the crankpins, {{also known}} as crank journals are the [...] of the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.|$|R
50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver it to the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> All <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> A similar system {{may be used to}} lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|An {{undercut}} crankshaft {{is a form}} of crankshaft for piston engines, {{where the}} overall length of the crankshaft is shortened by overlapping the main bearings of the crankshaft with the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> of the connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|The engine had its {{cylinders}} cast {{together with}} the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with counterbalancing weights. The <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were flanged over {{the sides of the}} crankshaft to locate the rods against the crank webs, which reduced engine noise.|$|R
40|$|The conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components of internal combustion engines; it is usually subjected to high dynamic loads and high sliding velocities between contacting surfaces are often involved. Therefore, the tribological behaviour of the conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> is often one of the key elements to engine reliability, and it has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in several contributions in the pertinent literature [1]. With the ever-increasing quest to improve engine performance, and the consequent increase of the rotational speed and combustion/inertial loads, the cavitation of the lubricant used in conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> may play a crucial role in the assessment of bearing durability. To overcome problems related to film cavitation, palliatives such as the reduction of the clearance between the components, the increase of the oil supply pressure and/or the use of harder coating materials have been commonly adopted. However, such simple adjustments do not always represent a valid solution; further investigations are required in order to avoid cavitation damage occurrence. The cavitation damage has been studied for more than a century both theoretically [2 - 5] and experimentally [6, 7], and many attempts have been made to predict or measure the pressure spikes developing in the cavitated areas due to bubble collapse. Although a universally accepted theory seems not to exist, it is clear that the cavitation damage occurs due to the rapid and violent collapse of the vapour bubbles in the proximity of a solid boundary. The aim of the present work is the preliminary evaluation of the damaging effect of the cavitation in a conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> via elasto-hydrodinamic numerical analyses...|$|R
50|$|The <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were {{lubricated}} by jets from an {{oil gallery}} in the crankcase, the oil striking the crankshaft webs which were drilled accordingly. Originally the journal diameter was 1.125"; this was later increased to 1.3125". The three bearing engine (from 1936) used a white metal centre bearing.|$|R
50|$|It had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors, {{inclined}} at 49 degrees, with {{an unusual}} float tank system used rather than float bowls. Plain bearings {{were used for the}} <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and the centre main bearings. The outer main bearings were rollers. One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} practice, the {{crankshaft}} and connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> {{in a modern}} automobile engine are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the bearing caps. The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze which is in turn coated with {{a thin layer of}} Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.|$|R
50|$|Internal combustions engines require {{lubrication}} {{in operation}} that moving parts slide smoothly over each other. Insufficient lubrication subjects {{the parts of}} the engine to metal-to-metal contact, friction, heat build-up, rapid wear often culminating in parts becoming friction welded together e.g. pistons in their cylinders. <b>Big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> seizing up will sometimes lead to a connecting rod breaking and poking out through the crankcase.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, a 500 cc {{version with}} linked {{front and rear}} brakes appeared, and the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were now fed oil through the {{crankshaft}} pin. The old 350 cc was dropped in 1926. For 1928 Rudge motorcycles were fitted with saddle tanks, and 8-inch internal expanding drum brakes. Stanley Glanfield designed a Rudge for dirt racing, marketed from 1928 as the Glanfield Rudge.|$|R
25|$|The Griffon was {{the first}} Rolls-Royce {{production}} aero engine to use a hollow crankshaft as the means of lubricating the main and <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> providing a more even distribution of oil to each bearing. In another change from convention, one high efficiency B.T.H-manufactured dual magneto was mounted {{on top of the}} propeller reduction casing; earlier Rolls-Royce designs using twin magnetos mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main <b>bearings,</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and camshaft bearings or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|R
5000|$|Bigend Saddle (...) is a snow-covered saddle at the {{southwest}} side of Mount Betty in northern Herbert Range, Queen Maud Mountains. The saddle was traversed in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould. It was {{named by the}} Southern Party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition, 1963-64, {{because one of the}} party's motor toboggans was abandoned here with a smashed <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|One-piece, {{machined}} from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome {{molybdenum steel}} forging. Statically and dynamically balanced. Seven main bearings and six throws. Internal oilway, with feed from both ends, used to distribute lubricants to main and <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> [...] "Floating" [...] front <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> consisting of an internally toothed annulus bolted to crankshaft, meshing with and incorporating a semi-floating ring, internally splined {{to a short}} coupling shaft.

25|$|The Rolls-Royce {{design team}} {{realised}} that producing a scaled-up version of their Griffon V-12 engine {{would lead to}} excessively large combustion chambers and problems with detonation. The team concluded that {{a larger number of}} small cylinders would be the answer and considered an X-24 design. This layout had previously caused unreliability with the Rolls-Royce Vulture due to the need to fasten four connecting rods in a complicated arrangement to a common <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The engine, carried {{forward from}} the 18 h.p. York model of the Sixteen had {{received}} small improvements which increased the engine's output. The engine benefited from improvements to the 12hp engine found in the new Ascot of 1936. The crankshaft is supported on 4 bearings and the main and <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are of the shell type. The 1938 season engine benefited from higher compression, bigger valves and an aluminium cylinder head with thermostat fitted. These often cracked upon removal.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> from inside. The <b>end</b> main <b>bearings</b> and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's sight glasses give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|R
2500|$|The A4 {{class had}} {{previously}} {{had problems with}} the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> for the middle cylinder, so the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> was fitted with a [...] "stink bomb" [...] of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. Shortly after attaining the record speed, the middle <b>big</b> <b>end</b> did overheat and Mallard had to limp onwards to Peterborough. It then travelled to Doncaster for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case Mallard {{did not make it}} back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.|$|R
25|$|The Air Ministry {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the accident under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations, 1922. The investigation opened on 25 June at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, with Sir Arthur Colefax in charge. The cause of the engine failure was the fracture of No. 4 connecting rod in the starboard engine. The engine had run for 126 hours since its last overhaul, with the permitted time between overhauls being 300 hours. The connecting rod had failed due to the failure of the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> studs.|$|R
40|$|A {{realistic}} {{analysis of}} dynamically loaded journal bearings requires {{the prediction of}} active film region moving boundaries, thermal and elastic bearing deformations and viscosity variations due to the temperature changes in lubricant film. The following paper is aimed to develop, taking advantage of enhanced structural modeling, a thermo-elastohydrodynamic (TEHD) analysis method, fully based on the finite element technique. To this purpose updated mass and energy-conserving models, independent on the finite element type, are proposed. As an example, the detailed (three-dimensional) TEHD analysis of a connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> is performed, using different formulations of the lubrication problem...|$|R
50|$|A {{rectangular}} cross-section aluminium casting holds the five main bearings and the bearings {{for the two}} camshafts. This makes the sump below the crankcase independent and its removal does not disturb the engine's crankshaft or its bearings. Either camshaft can be removed sideways at any time through large doors which also give access to the small rock-levers through which the cams operate the pushrods. Another set of detachable doors on each side gives access to each <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b> The aluminium casting forming the crankcase rests on two cast-steel cradles which firmly hold the engine in the chassis.|$|R
50|$|A tunnel crankcase, tunnel {{crankshaft}} or disc-webbed crankshaft {{engine is}} a diesel engine where the crankshaft is {{designed so that}} the main bearings (the bearings that support the crankshaft within the crankcase) are enlarged in diameter, such {{that they are now}} larger than the crank webs (the radial arms that link the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> to the main bearings). They thus form the largest diameter of any part of the crankshaft. Rather than a conventional crankcase that has webs across it to support the narrow bearings of a conventional crankcase, the crankcase now has a large tunnel through it, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|Engine {{parts were}} {{recovered}} {{and taken to}} the engine overhauler’s workshops for supervised examination and dismantling. The bearings and other internal engine parts {{were found to be}} in order with no signs of overheating or seizure. The engine crankshaft had broken between the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> of the 6th cylinder and the main bearing in the engine casing at the flywheel end. This break exhibited marks characteristic of a fatigue failure. The torque load on the crankshaft of an engine on full power is at its maximum between the last cylinder and the flywheel, the location of the fracture.|$|R
50|$|When {{describing}} a crankshaft design, {{the number of}} main bearings is generally quoted, {{as the number of}} crank pins is determined by the engine configuration. For example, a crankshaft for an inline six engine will be described as three bearing or four bearing depending on its number of main bearings; The crank pins are not counted in this description. Similarly, when speaking of a crankshaft, the journals are the main bearing journals only. The crank pins are not normally called journals although they form the centre shafts of the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and are therefore journals in the more general sense.|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated locomotive axles also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher resistance to heat.|$|R

After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars, a more sophisticated method of filtering out the cylinder and valve lubricant from the exhaust steam replaced the original centrifuge while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the study is the conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> of an high {{performance}} motorbike engine. Comparative analyses involving different geometrical configurations of the crankpin/conrod assemblies, and in particular of different shapes of the inner profile of the bearing, are presented. The influence of the properties of the lubricant is also discussed. A preliminary cavitation damage index is proposed based on the variation in time of the void fraction at a certain location. The results obtained show a strong influence of the geometry of the bearing on the cavitation phenomenon. Experimental evidence qualitatively agrees with numerical forecasts, thus corroborating the use of both the methodology and the cavitation damage index proposed in this contribution...|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} by combining two four-cylinder units used for railcars into the eight-cylinder (MkI) engine. These were intended to give an output of [...] at 1,000 rpm but in practice, had a continuous output rating of only [...] with a maximum of 650 hp. At 17 tons for the five, they were six tons above design weight. The weight with the power car was over three tons per engine. The <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were also found {{to be prone to}} early failure, In addition, there were two critical vibration frequencies which coincided with idling and cruising speeds, resulting in a limitation on the maximum rpm and consequently a reduction in power output.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the crankshaft <b>bearing</b> half <b>shells</b> and the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional <b>bearing</b> <b>shells</b> with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Koreyvo, Jumo and Napier Deltic engines {{used one}} piston per {{cylinder}} to expose an intake port, {{and the other}} to expose an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this regard. This layout gives superior scavenging, as gas flow through the cylinder is axial rather than radial, and simplifies design of the piston crowns. In the Jumo 205 and its variants, the upper crankshaft serves the exhaust pistons, and the lower crankshaft the intake pistons. In designs using multiple cylinder banks, such as the Junkers Jumo 223 and the Deltic, each <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> serves one inlet and one exhaust piston, using a forked connecting rod for the exhaust piston.|$|R
