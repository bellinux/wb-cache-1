40|$|From the introduction]. ‘Europeanisation’ {{has become}} a focal point of {{discussion}} in European integration studies. Although the term is used in different ways to describe a variety of phenomena, its meanings have usually been restricted to (in a strict sense) political processes, i. e. domestic political changes caused by European integration. Most studies have emphasised top-down dynamics inherent in this particular notion of Europeanisation, whereas bottom-up and/or transnational processes and attempts to analyse their interplay have entered the debate only recently. We seek to contribute to this debate by focusing on what we describe as the ‘societal/trans-national’ dimension of Europeanisation: this dimension encapsulates (1) the level and sphere of change; and (2) the type of agency generating or resisting change. In this paper, we seek to analyse the impact of European-level governance – the case law of the European Court of Justice and the Community’s competences {{in the area of}} competition policy – on German football. More particularly we will look at the nationality issue related to the <b>Bosman</b> ruling (<b>case</b> 1), the new transfer regime resulting from the <b>Bosman</b> ruling (<b>case</b> 2), and the issue of broadcasting rights (case 3). In the broader context, additional factors are considered which less clearly relate to the European integration process, such as the development of the Champions League (case 4) or the emergence of transnational groupings like the G- 14 (case 5). Taken together, these processes add up to the ongoing ‘Europeanisation’ of (German) football. By analysing five cases of Europeanisation within the realm of German football, we not only want to shed some light on an under-researched field of study for political scientists interested in ‘Europeanising’ mechanisms. It also allows us to explore the general applicability of Europeanisation factors (sources, dynamics and level of change), which have been derived mainly from the analysis of more politico-economic contexts, to explain dynamics in societal, i. e. rather non-political, contexts. This way we may also clarify potential ‘blind-spots’, i. e. dynamics and interrelated mechanisms in Europeanisation processes that have been largely ignored by traditional analyses. Our empirical focus is salient as it represents a social context, which forms an important and conscious part of citizens’ lives (rather than an abstract and inaccessible sphere). This may enable us to gain a deeper understanding of Europeanisation regarding citizens’ life worlds. Our paper will first elucidate the concept of Europeanisation and specify our understanding of the term. Secondly, we will outline the societal/transnational dimension of Europeanisation. The third section attempts to formulate some systemising factors of the Europeanisation process which guides our empirical analysis of five subcases related to German football that will follow thereafter...|$|R
40|$|T]he {{focus here}} is the {{question}} of whether national eligibility criteria-i. e., those regulations that govern who can be selected to play for a national side as opposed to a club side-are compatible with freedom of movement provisions. This paper locates that question {{within the context of the}} abolition of "quotas" pertaining to club sides. In various judgments both prior to and after Bosman, the ECJ has indicated that, were national eligibility criteria to be challenged, the Court would be minded to uphold them. But in this paper I contend that the legal basis upon which such a ruling would be made is far from watertight. The ECJ's intimations that national eligibility restrictions are matters of "purely sporting interest" and, as such, would be exempt from the rigors of EU are problematic.

40|$|Athletic talent {{migration}} has pervaded football {{throughout the}} game’s professional history. In Australia the instances of player migration {{has increased dramatically}} {{in the last two}} decades. This thesis is designed to explore the rate and flow of athletic talent migration in Australian football, and analyse the way in which world football has evolved to establish an environment conducive to player migration. Quantitative results highlight that from 1980 – 1989 the average number of Australian football migrants was 7 players per year increasing to 172 players per year for the period of 2000 – 2009. These migrations place Australian football talent all over the world, with the largest contingent choosing Europe (80 %) to forge their football careers. Within Europe, England (27 %) is far and away the preferred destination of Australian footballers. World Systems is the theoretical paradigm used to explain the global forces acting on a domestic level that have contributed to this dramatic increase in migration. World-systems theory posits four key areas (1. economic gain, 2. Core-periphery relationship, 3. Division of labour and expansion, 4. Shifts in the loci of accumulation and power), that influence the increase in athletic talent migration. The key concept of core-periphery relationship defines the global football dynamic and through three key historical events, the <b>Bosman</b> <b>case</b> of 1994, the commodification of football and the development of the Champions League, players from peripheral and semi-peripheral nation states have been motivated to migrate to the wealthy European core of world football. Player typologies and the investigation of push/pull factors have also been utilized within this thesis to understand migration at a micro level. These typologies and push/pull factors have been focused on the Australian football context and show the unique factors that influence the Australian football player to migrate. The considerable increase in Australian football player migration attests to significant impact global forces have had on the domestic game...|$|E
40|$|Three {{years after}} the <b>Bosman</b> <b>case,</b> {{it was decided that}} a {{socio-cultural}} approach on sports be introduced in Europe. EU presented a formulation for the same purpose – The European Model of Sport. The purpose of this formula was to maintain the socio-culture and traditional ap¬proach to all kinds of amateur and professional sports in Europe. If we were to com¬pare this model with the American model of sport, it shows many different ways of thinking in terms of organised sport. However, both models show that they have to adjust to the processes that are on-going in western societies. The development of civilisation, professionalisation, com-mer¬cialisation, commodification, and globalisation are all processes to which sports have to adjust. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, another process was introduced, this was called “ju¬ridification”, which is very prevalent today. The process of “juridification” involved all legalities in the sports system. The purpose of introducing this process was mainly to question the sports autonomy. The autonomy in sport defines itself as a self-regulator and {{is not part of the}} civil law. A ma¬jor part of the “ques¬tion¬ables” to the sports autonomy is, that sports of to-day have a symbiotic relationship with the media industry and the commercial market, which means that there is a huge in-flow of cash into elite sports. However, this has become a ques-tionable aspect, as to why sport should not be part of the competition law as any other busi-ness. As a result of this, several legal cases relating to sports are ending up in courts. EU has a divided and vague approach when it comes to handling these matters. On the one hand it de¬clares clearly that economic activities should be part of the EU law and on the other hand, if sports cases go to trial to the Competition Law, it would be decided on a case-to-case basis. In the US, pro¬fessional sports are part of the Common Law and their sports, had on a much earlier stage become involved with the judicial system.

40|$|International {{audience}} 18. 1 INTRODUCTION France, {{in common}} with other leading European football nations, was affected by two significant economic shocks in the 1990 s. One was the globalisation of the labour market for football players which occurred after the <b>Bosman</b> <b>case</b> in 1995; {{the other was a}} substantial change in the format and financial endowment of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) club competitions, accelerated by the failed attempt by Media-Partners in 1999 to create a European Super-League. How has French professional football adjusted to this double shock since 2000 ? Did French football adjust better or worse than the other major European leagues to the changing financial realities of professional football at the highest level? Many French sports analysts are inclined to cite the French Ligue 1 (FL 1) as the best-managed football league in Europe. It is suggested that the French exception copes better than others with football's financial pressures. This exception has been praised as a virtuous example for other European major football leagues such as the English Premier League (EPL), Italian Lega Calcio (ILC), Spanish Liga de Futbol (SLF) and German Bundesliga (GBL). Some French official reports went as far as to recommend making a rule out of this exception by extending it to all leagues under UEFA's jurisdiction (Collin, 2004; Denis, 2003). Another report more modestly questions the preconditions for French football clubs to become both more competitive on the pitch, and economically sound (Besson, 2008). The claimed advantages of the French model may have been influential in informing the thinking underlying the UEFA Financial Fair Play rules. The French model, however, is not universally admired throughout Europe, especially in the countries with the most powerful football leagues. There are at least three criticisms. First, it is argued that relatively weak sporting performance at the European level is the price paid for sound financial management. An extreme variant of this argument, often voiced abroad, is that the French football authorities focus on sound finance to the detriment of sporting performance. Second, smaller deficits and debts may be more an index of the French clubs' lack of competitiveness than an example of exemplary management. Third, in some countries (for example, the UK, Ireland and the Czech Republic), the French football league and economy are considered to be too heavily regulated, to the detriment of both competitiveness and the level of sporting performance. Rather than dismiss such views out of hand as belonging to the realm of caricature, this chapter considers whether they contain any grain of truth, and searches for a balanced response. Section 18. 2 begins with an assessment of French football sporting and financial performance. Section 18. 3 examines the inputs mobilised for attaining such performance, in order to evaluate in section 18. 4 the efficiency of professional football clubs in France. Against the background of a typically optimistic financial self-assessment on the part of French football clubs, section 18. 5 examines the sources and structure of French professional football: how much different? 299 professional football finance, as well as the role of the league's auditing body. Section 18. 6 presents a more personal analysis, stressing the football clubs' soft budget constraint and a vicious circle between the increasing commercial value of TV broadcasting rights, and skyrocketing club payrolls. Section 18. 7 concludes by drawing some brief conclusions about the future of French professional football. 18. 2 A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND SPORTING PERFORMANCE...|$|E
40|$|The free {{movement}} of workers enshrined in Article 45 TFEU {{is one of the}} fundamental principles of the European Union. Although Article 45 TFEU contains clear references to specific rights for workers, which have been implemented in several pieces of secondary legislation (e. g. Directive 2004 / 38, Regulation (EU) No 492 / 2011 as well as Regulations (EC) No 883 / 2004 and (EC) No 987 / 2009), the key concepts regarding the scope of application of the {{free movement}} of workers derive from case law. Article 45 TFEU applies to migrant workers, i. e. persons performing services for and under the direction of another person in return for which they receive remuneration, provided their activity is not marginal and ancillary. This includes full-time workers, part-time workers (no matter how many hours worked), seasonal workers, frontier workers, working students and jobseekers. Article 45 TFEU does not apply to non-remunerated work including voluntary work and care work within the family unit. It is open to debate whether it should apply to internships and other forms of non-remunerated work which are aimed at facilitating access to the paid labour market. Migration exists whenever the worker has moved between EU Member States: this includes migration to another Member State to work there; returning to the home State after having worked abroad; and living in one Member State and working in a different one. Article 45 TFEU can be invoked also by employers to challenge restrictions on the possibility to hire workers. The family of the worker is also protected by both primary and secondary provisions of EU law. In order to be protected by the Treaty {{free movement of}} workers provisions a claimant must fall within the personal scope of the Treaty, i. e. he or she must fall within the definition of worker. Even though the concept of worker has been interpreted broadly, there are some grey areas, in particular in relation to employment which pursues an ulterior aim, such as social reintegration schemes. For the claimant, being classified as a worker is of paramount importance since the status carries a wealth of rights (non-discrimination, access to benefits, unconditional right to reside in the host State). Work also needs to be remunerated, but the concept of remuneration is flexible so that a quid pro quo (such as board and lodging) might count as remuneration. However, certain work (internships, apprenticeships etc) is often of economic value for the employer, and of value to the person performing it; and yet, the fact that such activity attracts no remuneration might leave a vulnerable section of workers devoid of protection in European law. Next to that, Member States may police the definition of worker rather rigidly, so that those who work are in fact treated as economically inactive, and so subject to indirectly discriminatory rules that would not be justified if applied to workers. The Commission should be ready to challenge any restrictive practices in defining migrant work, which may result in significant detriment to part-time workers. The same should be said in relation to atypical work contracts, such as zero-hours contracts, and there are also problems with the status of compulsory work placements in order to receive benefits. Therefore, given the changed landscape of the labour market, in order to determine whether there is an employment relationship the focus should be on whether the worker is able to refuse work offered (useful guidelines could be provided by national laws on the application of minimum terms and wages and similar), rather than on the remuneration. The Commission should also be alive to measures that discriminate against migrant workers once they have become unemployed, challenging restrictive approaches to the retention of worker status which can result in sudden loss of social protection, and arguing that such restrictions defy the broad approach to be taken to defining workers under Article 45 TFEU. Where possible, it would be advisable to characterise migrants as workers in order to trigger the strongest obligations with regard to both indirect discrimination and obstacles to movement. Measures that appear to be directed at the economically inactive can have significant effects upon migrant workers, increasing the disadvantages of becoming unemployed, even though many migrant workers move between jobs, and so making their work more precarious. The use of Article 45 TFEU in the context of access to the labour market, and an empirically evidenced, broad approach to benefits necessary to subsist, and so make access to the labour market possible, could help to avoid {{a situation in which the}} biggest obstacles to the free movement of workers are obstacles that prevent migrants from becoming migrant workers in the first place, or from regaining worker status having become unemployed. This could be combined with contesting indirect discrimination, wherever the measures in question can be framed as restricting access to benefits that facilitate access to the labour market. Measures that make it more difficult for own state nationals to seek work having worked elsewhere in the EU should be identified and challenged. Finally, the Commission has a role to play, both through case work, and through awareness-raising activities, in stressing to national legislatures and judiciaries the importance of the prohibition of obstacles to movement. This is especially important in the light of the new Enforcement Directive; Member States need to appreciate and implement the principles contained therein if they are to effectively enforce them. Article 45 TFEU prevents national rules that discriminate directly on grounds of nationality, e. g. only Italians can work for the Ministry of Defence. These rules can be justified by relying on the Treaty derogations. It is also directed towards measures that discriminate indirectly on grounds of nationality, e. g. in order to be employed in a school the worker needs to be fluent in Italian. These rules can be justified on imperative grounds of public interest provided they are necessary and proportionate. Finally, Article 45 precludes obstacles/barriers/restrictions to the worker’s ability or desirability to move or access the market, e. g. a worker returning to Italy after having worked abroad will not be eligible for certain benefits; or a worker cannot be employed by more than one employer, or in more than one Member State. These rules can also be justified on imperative grounds of public interest as above. Although there are numerous studies and doctrinal contributions on the development from a discrimination approach toward an obstacle approach and all the consequences this has, it should be stressed that most free movement of persons cases could be treated using a discrimination approach, albeit ‘discrimination based on migration’ rather than pure nationality discrimination. The language of obstacles is in itself perhaps a bit misleading, since the cases predominantly deal with obstacles to movement rather than mere obstacles to market access experienced after movement. The construct of discrimination on grounds of movement might also help with making ‘obstacle’ arguments more accessible in national courts, by framing them as a familiar, hard legal concept (discrimination), and accepting inherent limits hinted at by the <b>Bosman</b> <b>case</b> law, that only measures penalising the exercise of free movement rights be caught. Discrimination on grounds of migration has the advantage of creating clearer boundaries (therefore making it easier to apply law) to the free movement of persons, whilst at the same time being less intrusive to national regulatory autonomy. The classification as ‘discrimination’ or ‘obstacles/restrictions/barriers’ in the case law should not be considered excessively rigid. What really matters is whether the rule has an effect on intra-Union migration. If such an effect is found through either discrimination or a barrier to movement or an obstacle, then the rule will have to be justified. In order to claim indirect discrimination it is sufficient that the rule might affect more foreigners or migrants than nationals and no particular evidence is required. In order to claim an obstacle it is sufficient to show that the rule might deter or discourage the free movement of workers, or that it might constitute a barrier to market access. Again no particular evidence is required. For this reason, it is advisable to claim both discrimination and obstacle in litigation. There are nonetheless some manifest differences between the discrimination and the obstacle approach. If a finding of discrimination can be supported by statistical data, then it will be very difficult for the Member State to defend such discrimination. A finding of discrimination is then again politically less problematic. This is so because if the CJEU finds discrimination the Member State might amend the rules simply to remove that discrimination, whilst if the CJEU finds that the rule is an unjustified obstacle to free movement the Member State will have to remove the rule for all economic operators. This might be very important should governments seek to introduce new restrictions on, for instance, the possibility to claim benefits or social advantages. Once discrimination is established the Graf doctrine (effect of rule too remote and indirect) cannot be invoked: no matter how minimal the discrimination is, it always needs to be justified. On the other hand, the Member State might attempt to reverse a claim of discrimination with statistical data (albeit this would not be conclusive). There are also inherent limits to the definition of ‘obstacle’, as a rule is not to be considered an obstacle if it is inherent in the organisation of the employment concerned or if the effect of the rule is too uncertain and indirect to be qualified as a barrier to movement. Finally, it can be observed that the justification of indirect discrimination and obstacles runs along similar lines. In several cases the CJEU does not carry out a separate assessment of necessity and proportionality, so that it would simply look at whether the measure is ‘appropriate’ and necessary to achieve the purported aim. In more recent times, the scrutiny as to the necessity of measures has also focused on issues such as the coherence of the rule within the legal system. Case law suggests that where both are established, indirect discrimination may be more readily justified by a Member State than obstacles to movement, where the former typically affect non-nationals and the latter own nationals. The more traditional proportionality assessment, on the other hand, focuses very much on whether the restriction on the person’s freedom is out of proportion with the policy aim pursued. ‘Proportionality proper’ is a very useful tool in the armoury of private claimants, especially in those cases where the rule itself might be legitimate but the application of the rule to that particular claimant is disproportionate because of the hardship it would cause. ‘Proportionality proper’ is less useful in relation to the abstract review of legislation (as it is carried out in Commission proceedings) where rules can only be declared either compatible or incompatible with Union law without there been any possibility for an individual assessment. In those cases, the analysis would focus on whether the measure is appropriate and necessary as detailed above...|$|E
