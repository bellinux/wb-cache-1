40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{is a novel}} {{process to}} produce ultra high strength automobile components without any spring back. Simultaneous forming and quenching of the hot blanks after austenization result in fully martensitic microstructures in the final products. Austenization treatment of the <b>blanks,</b> <b>transferring</b> the hot <b>blanks</b> from he furnace to the tools and simultaneous forming and rapid cooling in the die are the main steps during hot stamping process. Many car manufacturers have been focused on hot stamping to produce various ultra high strength components so that decreasing the weight as well as increasing safety of the cars. 22 MnB 5 boron alloyed steel is the common steel which is used by hot stamping. The mentioned steel has acceptable hardenability and produces fully lath martensitic microstructure after hot stamping. The yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength after hot stamping are increased to approximately 1000 MPa and 1500 MPa, respectively. The main objectives of the present research were based on: Development of a laboratory set up for simulating hot stamping process, Investigation on different steel grades {{with respect to their}} mechanical properties after hot stamping, Numerical simulation of the hot stamping process...|$|R
40|$|The blank size, {{determining}} the deformation degree and {{the ratio of}} axial to radial feed amount of the radial-axial ring rolling process for TA 15 titanium alloy, has a strong effect on the grain size and volume fraction of primary α phase, which determine the mechanical properties of the rolled ring. In this paper, a macro-micro 3 D-FE model of the radial-axial ring rolling of TA 15 titanium alloy has been developed under ABAQUS software. The ring <b>blank</b> <b>transferring</b> from heating furnace to rolling mill, rolling and cooling after rolling during the whole process are considered in the FE model.

40|$|Due to {{the demands}} to {{reducing}} the gas emissions, energy saving and producing safer vehicles have driven the development of {{ultra high strength steel}}. Since the mechanical properties of ultra high strength steel are remarkably high, it has become a major setback for forming process and this has led lead to the development of special forming technique for ultra high strength steel called Hot Stamping. In hot stamping, the ultra high strength steel blank is heated to its austenization temperature of about 900 - 950 ◦C inside the furnace. Then, the heated <b>blank</b> is <b>transferred</b> to the tool where forming takes place and simultaneously quench the blank inside the tool. As the tool dwells, the microstructure of the blank becomes fully martensite thus giving the final part strength of up to 1500 MPa. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the Hot Stamping Process, a numerical model of heat transfer need to be developed to simulate the temperature changes of the blank as well as validate the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of the blank and tool contact surface as a function of distance and time. The numerical model is based on the heat transfer at the contact surface between the ultra high strength steel blank (Boron Manganese Steel) and the tool made of Tool Steel (SKD 11) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with respiratory failure, extracorporeal lung support can ensure the vital gas exchange via gas permeable membranes but its application is restricted by limited long-term stability and hemocompatibility {{of the gas}} permeable membranes, which are {{in contact with the}} blood. Endothelial cells lining these membranes promise physiological hemocompatibility and should enable prolonged application. However, the endothelial cells increase the diffusion barrier of the blood-gas interface and thus affect gas transfer. In this study, we evaluated how the endothelial cells affect the gas exchange to optimize performance while maintaining an integral cell layer. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded on gas permeable cell culture membranes and cultivated in a custom-made bioreactor. Oxygen <b>transfer</b> rates of <b>blank</b> and endothelialized membranes in endothelial culture medium were determined. Cell morphology was assessed by microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Both setups provided oxygenation of the test fluid featuring small standard deviations of the measurements. Throughout the measuring range, the endothelial cells seem to promote gas transfer to a certain extent exceeding the <b>blank</b> membranes gas <b>transfer</b> performance by up to 120 %.

40|$|To qualify {{tools of}} {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, particles unintentionally deposited in these tools are characterized using blank wafers. With fast optical inspection tools one can quickly localize these particle defects. An example is TNO's Rapid Nano, which operates in optical dark field. The {{next step is}} defect review for further defect characterization. When the <b>blank</b> wafers are <b>transferred</b> to another tool, e. g. a SEM or an AFM the absolute defect position information is lost. Therefore, the re-detection of the defects in the review tool is time consuming. To enhance the re-detection speed, a fiducial marker system can be used that couples the coordinates of the fast inspection tool to the coordinates of the characterization (review) tool. In this work such a fiducial marker system was designed and validated. The influences of the height and {{the composition of the}} fiducial markers on the performance of the marker system were investigated using finite element analysis (by COMSOL) and experiments. The optimized fiducial markers are very visible in optical bright field and in SEM, while almost invisible (“stealth”) in optical dark field. These properties make the markers both easily visible and accurately localizable in the characterization tools. The stealth fiducial marker system was fabricated and validated by re-detecting programmed test defects on a blank wafer. The experimental results are compared to a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account the uncertainties in the coordinate transformation and localization of the test defects. Our results show that a fiducial marker system greatly enhances the re-detection efficacy of defects on blank wafers. Using the fiducial marker system, 100 % of the test defects were re-detected in SEM and AFM. A single 7 × 7 μm 2 SEM image suffices to meet the ITRS requirement for particles as small as 70 nm in diameter...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY It is {{now well}} {{established}} that although acetylsalicylate does {{not interfere with}} the commonly used nitration method for measuring paracetamol, salicylate does interfere. Several methods have been used to remove this interference, by solvent extraction, or to make allowance for the interference, for example, by arithmetical correction. We describe a new approach to the problem by modifying the reaction conditions in an attempt to find the optimum conditions for the nitration of paracetamol {{while at the same time}} minimising salicylate interference. A method is proposed in which the concentration of nitrite is reduced and a time delay is introduced after the addition of sulphamic acid. This method is shown to be accurate, precise, and linear and exhibits minimal interference from salicylate. Add 10 ml distilled water to a nitrite tube and mix well. This will be sufficient for 10 analyses (~ 75 mg per assay). 2 Add 1 ml plasma to a TCA tube. Mix well and centrifuge at 1600 g for 8 minutes. Treat the 100 and 400 !lg/ml paracetamol standards and water for the <b>blank</b> similarly. 3 <b>Transfer</b> 3 ml of the supernatants to 150 x 23 mm glass tubes with ground glass stoppers. Add 1 ml of the nitrite solution and start the stopwatch. Swirl very gently. Do not mix vigorously. 4 Exactly 5 minutes after adding the nitrite add I ml of the sulphamic acid solution slowly (over about 5 seconds) followed by a further 1 ml when the effervescence has died down. Do not mix the tubes but transfer them to the water bath. 5 Exactly 10 minutes after adding the nitrite add 5 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. Stopper the tubes and mix briefly on a vortex mixer.

25|$|Unlike his entrance, Weltlich's {{departure}} did {{not result}} in an exodus of players from the program. Penders' first team returned four starters from the previous season, and two talented transfers—Lance Blanks and Joey Wright—gained eligibility, giving Texas a starting five with three future NBA Draft picks and a fourth starter who would play in the NBA. Penders led his first team to a 25–9 overall record, marking the first 20-win season in ten years at Texas and the then-second-highest win total in school history. He quickly validated his promise to bring high-scoring offense to Texas: in the first nine games of the 1988–89 season, the Longhorns scored more than 100 points five times. In Bob Weltlich's 175 games as head coach, Texas had never scored 100 or more points in a game—and had only scored 90 or more points on four occasions (twice requiring an overtime period to reach that mark). The Longhorns opened the season with an 8–1 record before traveling to Oklahoma City to compete in the four-team All-College Tournament. Texas players openly marveled at the wholesale change in coaching philosophy from prior seasons to one that now encouraged them to shoot in large volumes, and some expressed eagerness to see how they would fare against elite competition with their new style of play. Texas defeated the OSU Cowboys 85–84 in the first contest behind 32 points from sophomore guard Joey Wright and two late free throws from junior guard Lance <b>Blanks,</b> who had <b>transferred</b> from Virginia. The win matched Texas in the tournament final against a high-scoring, sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners team only nine months removed from a four-point loss as a prohibitive favorite in the 1988 national championship game. Billy Tubbs' Sooners revealed the distance that remained between Texas and college basketball's elite teams, building a 63–37 halftime lead en route to an easy 124–95 win. Texas won six games in conference play by five or fewer points to finish in second place in the SWC with a 12–4 record, with two losses to Arkansas and one loss apiece to Houston and Texas A Interspersed among the conference contests were games against NCAA Tournament-bound Vanderbilt, which Texas lost by a score of 94–79, and Miami (FL), which the Longhorns won easily, 123–104. Texas defeated both SMU and TCU in overtime in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final, in which Arkansas defeated the Longhorns {{for the third time in}} 10 weeks. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 11 seed to play in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 10 seasons, where the Longhorns would defeat the sixth-seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 76–70, for the program's first NCAA Tournament victory since 1972. Texas fell in the second round to the sixth-ranked and third-seeded Missouri Tigers, 108–89, to end the season at 25–9, a nine-win improvement over Weltlich's final season. The Longhorns' on-court success—in combination with Penders' appealing, fast-tempo brand of basketball and his tireless promotion of the Texas program—produced a rise in average home attendance from the prior season of almost 149 percent (from 4,028 to 10,011), the largest such increase in NCAA Division I basketball for the 1988–89 season.|$|R

Penders' second team finished 24-9 and qualified for the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year—a first in Longhorn basketball history—and for only the second time since the Tournament field expanded to 64 teams. Texas defeated No. 24 Florida in Austin, 105-94, in the fifth game of the season for its first win against ranked competition under Penders. The Longhorns would go on to lose their remaining regular-season contests against ranked opponents—to Shaquille O'Neal, Stanley Roberts, and No. 11 LSU in a neutral-site contest, 124-113; to No. 4 Oklahoma in Norman, 103-84; to No. 6 Arkansas in Fayetteville, 109-100, in a game that saw Mays depart in the first minutes due to a finger injury; and, finally, to No. 3 Arkansas in overtime in Austin, 103-96, in a famously bitter defeat that became known in UT lore as the [...] "Strollin' Nolan" [...] game. The Longhorns led by one point with 14 seconds remaining when Arkansas head coach Nolan Richardson, after an intentional foul call against a Razorback player, slowly walked off the court to the Arkansas locker room. The SWC officiating crew did not assess a technical foul against Richardson for leaving the court—a decision that the NCAA's chief rules interpreter would label a mistake. Nonetheless, Texas appeared to have the game in hand—leading by three, after Blanks made two free throws—until Arkansas's Lee Mayberry, the national leader in three-point field goal percentage, made a contested 30-foot shot with four seconds remaining to tie the game at 86-86 and send the game into overtime. Richardson then returned to the court, eliciting a resounding chorus of boos from the crowd, and Arkansas outscored Texas 17-10 in the overtime period to claim the win. Two losses to Houston left Texas with a 12-4 record and third-place finish in conference play. The Longhorns added wins against Rhode Island—the team Penders had coached before being hired by Texas—and DePaul during the regular season. Against Rhode Island, Travis Mays surpassed Ron Baxter's career scoring total to become the then-leading scorer in UT history. After their third win that season over Texas A&M in the SWC Tournament, the Longhorns would fall to Houston for the third time, 89-86. At 21-8, Texas was awarded a No. 10 seed in the NCAA Tournament. After an easy 100-88 win over the No. 7-seed Georgia Bulldogs, the Longhorns upset Gene Keady's No. 2-seeded Purdue Boilermakers, 73-72, to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 18 seasons. With a come-from-behind 102-89 win against the 28-4 Xavier Musketeers—in which Blanks, Mays, and Wright combined for 86 points—Texas advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time in 43 years to face its SWC archrival, the Arkansas Razorbacks, for the third time that season. Trailing by 16 points with 12 minutes remaining, the Longhorns mounted a comeback that fell just short, falling 88-85 as Travis Mays' last-second three-point attempt came off the rim. Mays finished the season as the Southwest Conference's all-time leading scorer, with 2,279 career points. Texas was ranked No. 12 in the post-Tournament Coaches Poll, matching the 1962-63 team for the highest end-of-season poll ranking in program history.|$|R
