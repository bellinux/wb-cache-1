25|$|A flow bench tests ports under {{a steady}} {{pressure}} difference {{while in the}} actual engine the pressure difference varies widely during the whole cycle. The exact flow conditions existing in the flow <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> exist only fleetingly if at all in an actual running engine. Running engines cause the air to flow in strong waves rather than the steady stream of the flow bench. This acceleration/deceleration of the fuel/air column causes effects not accounted for in flow bench tests.|$|E
