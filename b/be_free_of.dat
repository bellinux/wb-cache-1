Glad to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E
5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase.

The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E

In order to completely <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> Ares' oath, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so. Although free of his oath to the god, he was flooded with memories of killing his family.

5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E

Accordingly, he decided to change the plans for the operation, with all of the bombers now flying to Yagodnik first and mounting the attack from that airfield. Harris ordered the attack force to depart that afternoon, before advising the Air Ministry or Soviets of the change in plans.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus {{he sought to}} eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, {{it is difficult to}} stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries. In the US, after a campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979. In 1988 the World Health Organisation along with others launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and by 1994 the Americas were declared to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003. At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organisation. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in Nigeria, one in Chad, 58 in Pakistan and 37 in Afghanistan. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria {{at the beginning of}} 2013. In Pakistan, the campaign was further hampered by the murder on 26 February 2013 of a police officer who was providing security.|$|E

Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317 BC Philip III, by way of his politically-engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias, mother of Alexander III who still resided in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of Philip III and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor killed along with dozens of leading Macedonian nobles, yet {{by the spring of}} 316 BC Cassander defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.|$|E

5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E
