5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> that the CIA would have been so eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E

5|$|During the offseason, Ulis wore {{a walking}} boot {{on his right}} foot {{following}} a pick-up game injury for precautionary reasons. Ulis was also named to the 36-man 201415 Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List and the Wayman Tisdale Award Watch List. Ulis quickly {{earned a reputation as}} a difference maker whose contributions may not <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> in the statistics. On December 10, he was sidelined with an injury. Ulis posted a season-high 14 points on December 27 against Louisville in the Kentucky–Louisville rivalry game known as the Battle For The Bluegrass, earning the MVP of the game from the Bluegrass Sports Commission. On December 29, his effort was recognized with an SEC Freshman of the Week honor. Ulis did not start in any his 37 games played as a freshman, but averaged 23.8 minutes played. Following the season, he was named to the 8-man 2015 SEC All-Freshman Team. Kentucky went undefeated in its first 38 games before losing to Wisconsin in the Final Four of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Ulis led the team in assists per game.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the peak}} was {{suggested}} by an explorer named Chris Dickinson during the Cambridge Coast Mountains Expedition in 1979. It was adopted on November 24, 1980, and has been its official name since then. However, this name for the peak does not normally show up in any volcanological resources. Instead, it is informally referred to as Lava Fork or Lava Fork volcano due to its close association with the creek of the same name. The reason for this controversy is because The Volcano is generic. In speech it may not <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> whether The Volcano or the volcano is intended, leading to confusion. Similar named volcanoes in Canada include Volcano Vent in the Tuya volcanic field of northwestern British Columbia and Volcano Mountain in the Fort Selkirk volcanic field of central Yukon. As of 2009, the unofficial terms for The Volcano continue {{to be used by}} Natural Resources Canada.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but {{can be difficult to}} determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.|$|E

25|$|The {{prolapse}} may <b>be</b> <b>obvious,</b> or it {{may require}} straining and squatting to produce it.

A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{wastewater}} treatment plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play.

As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain {{wastewater treatment}} plants even if they are successfully developed.|$|E

25|$|In severe or {{untreated}} cases, {{the tympanic}} membrane may perforate, allowing the pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may <b>be</b> <b>obvious.</b> Even though the perforation of {{the tympanic membrane}} suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{anatomical}} {{comparison of}} {{structures in the}} embryos {{of two or more}} species provides evidence for a shared ancestor that may not <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> in the adult forms. As the embryo develops, these homologies can be lost to view, and the structures can take on different functions. Part of the basis of classifying the vertebrate group (which includes humans), is the presence of a tail (extending beyond the anus) and pharyngeal slits. Both structures appear during some stage of embryonic development but are not always obvious in the adult form.|$|E
