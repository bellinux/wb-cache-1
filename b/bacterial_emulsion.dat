40|$|By {{means of}} a method differing in {{important}} details from those of previous investigators it has been determined that the blood serum of cases of leprosy exhibits the ability to fix complement {{with a wide variety}} of antigens including to a greater or less extent those derived from any culture of the acid-fast group of bacteria available to us. This property of multiple fixation may sufficiently characterize the disease to be of diagnostic significance, although our experience is hardly sufficient to enable us to speak with complete assurance on this point. Certainly, control sera from normal individuals, from cases of tuberculosis, or from cases of syphilis as obtained in our locality have entirely failed to react with certain antigens, whereas serum from cases of leprosy have so reacted to the extent of over 93 per cent. The most characteristic fixation given by the leprosy sera is that with Bacillus lepræ (Clegg) used as antigen, either in the form of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>emulsion</b> or of an alcoholic extract of the dried culture. Antibody absorption may be demonstrated in the acid-fast group if the absorbing bacteria are removed by filtration. Otherwise the resulting fluid is strongly anticomplementary. Leper serum is not deprived of the complement-fixing body when so treated with either Bacillus tuberculosis or Bacillus lepræ (Clegg) ...|$|E
40|$|Contact {{angle of}} {{three-phase}} Abstract. In {{order to develop}} safe and sustainable food and pharmaceutical <b>emulsions,</b> <b>bacterial</b> cellulose (BC) nanofibrils were prepared to stabilize maize oil/water Pickering emulsions. The influence of BC content and pH value on the emulsion stability was explored. Droplet diameters decreased with BC contents in emulsions. At pH 12, the emulsions were most stable among all tested pH values. The transformation of emulsion structure from liquid to gel-like at 8 - 15 °C with BC content higher than 1. 55 g/L is predominantly depended on the viscoelastic entangled BC network. These results can have meaningful inspiration of designing edible food and pharmaceutical emulsions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Oil-in-water {{emulsions}} (20 % n-hexadecane, v/v) were stabilized by {{dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide}} (DTAB), Tween 20, or {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS). Particle size distribution and creaming stability were measured before and after adding Escherichia coli cells to emulsions. Both E. coli strains promoted droplet flocculation, coalescence, and creaming in DTAB emulsions, although JM 109 cells (surface charge = - 35 mV) caused faster creaming than E 21 cells (surface charge = - 5 mV). Addition of bacterial cells to SDS emulsions promoted some flocculation and coalescence, but creaming stability was unaffected. Droplet aggregation and accelerated creaming were not observed in emulsions prepared with Tween 20.

The capsules were designed to be recovered intact so that post experimental analysis could be done on the contents. ANSYS® AUTODYN hydrocode simulations were carried out to interrogate the deformation of the cover plate and the wave propagation in the fluid. Accordingly, we have shown that microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Zygosaccharomyces bailii are not affected by this type of loading regime. However, by introducing a cavity behind the broth we were able to observe limited kill in the yeast sample.

40|$|In {{earlier work}} we have {{demonstrated}} the effect that nano-emulsions have on bacterial growth, and most importantly the enhanced bacteriophage infectivity against S. aureus in planktonic culture when phage are carried in nano-emulsions. However, the mechanisms of enhancement of the bacteriophage killing effect are not specifically understood. This work focuses on {{the investigation of the}} possible interactions between <b>emulsion</b> droplets and <b>bacterial</b> cells, between <b>emulsion</b> droplets and bacteriophages, and finally interactions between all three components: nano-emulsion droplets, bacteria, and bacteriophages. The first approach consists of simple calculations to determine the spatial distribution of the components, based on measurements of particle size. It was found that nano-emulsion droplets are much more numerous than bacteria or bacteriophage, and due to their size and surface area they must be covering the surface of both cells and bacteriophage particles. Stabilisation of bacteriophages due to electrostatic forces and interaction with nano-emulsion droplets is suspected, since bacteriophages may be protected against inactivation due to ‘charge shielding’. Zeta potential was measured for the individual components in the system, and for all of them combined. It was concluded that the presence of nano-emulsions could be reducing electrostatic repulsion between bacterial cells and bacteriophage, both of which are very negatively ‘charged’. Moreover, nano-emulsions lead to more favourable interaction between bacteriophages and bacteria, enhancing the anti-microbial or killing effect. These findings are relevant since the physicochemical properties of nano-emulsions (i. e. particle size distribution and zeta potential) are key in determining the efficacy of the formulation against infection in the context of responsive burn wound dressings – which is the main target for this work...|$|R

The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf of}} the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. All rights reserved. BACKGROUND: Biofilms are characteristic of some chronic or recurrent infections and this mode of growth tends to reduce treatment efficacy. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is associated with a high rate of recurrent symptomatic disease. The presence and behaviour of C. difficile within intestinal biofilms remains largely unexplored, but may factor in recurrent infection. METHODS: A triple-stage chemostat gut model designed to facilitate the formation of intestinal biofilm was inoculated with a pooled human faecal <b>emulsion.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> populations were allowed to equilibrate before simulated CDI was induced by clindamycin (33. 9 mg/L, four times daily, 7 days) and subsequently treated with vancomycin (125 mg/L, four times daily, 7 days). Indigenous gut microbiota, C. difficile total viable counts, spores, cytotoxin and antimicrobial activity in planktonic and biofilm communities were monitored during the 10 week experimental period. RESULTS: Vancomycin successfully treated the initial episode of simulated CDI, but ??? 18 days after therapy cessation, recurrent infection occurred. Germination, proliferation and toxin production were evident within planktonic communities in both initial and recurrent CDI. In contrast, sessile C. difficile remained in dormant spore form {{for the duration of the}} experiment. The effects of and recovery from clindamycin and vancomycin exposure for sessile populations was delayed compared with responses for planktonic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal biofilms provide a potential reservoir for C. difficile spore persistence, possibly facilitating their dispersal into the gut lumen after therapeutic intervention, leading to recurrent infection. Therapeutic options for CDI could have increased efficacy if they are more effective against sessile C. difficile...|$|R
