40|$|The {{theory of}} inventive problem solving (TRIZ) is widely {{acclaimed}} by adoptees {{and in the}} academic literature. This research project set out {{to give an account}} of how TRIZ has been used in the industry in the UK by examining its use in a small sample of SMEs (Small, Medium Enterprises) and also a <b>blue</b> <b>chip</b> <b>company</b> in order to clarify whether this technique is really as good as its proponents states or there are problems in its application. A series of surveys and a practical TRIZ event identified an apparent disparity between the low reported industrial take-up of TRIZ and perceptions within the TRIZ community which indicate more widespread use. After consulting with TRIZ experts, it is thought that {{one of the main reasons}} for this is because of the perception that TRIZ is complicated and hard to use. For this reason, a new process has been developed which can be incorporated in association with TRIZ to benefit and improve the use of TRIZ.
