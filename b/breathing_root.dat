5000|$|Salix warburgii {{grows in}} the water. Due to the thin skin, it coudn't live without water. Because its leaves can't keep water in, it should as soon as {{possible}} fail into water to germinate and grow up. The bare <b>breathing</b> <b>root</b> and the body of a lot of dehygrogen enzymes can make Salix warburgii to adapt the water environmental.|$|E
40|$|Mangrove Ecosystems play an {{important}} role in preventing cyclones and tsunamis at estuaries from entering into interior land and in the economic development of local inhabitants. Mangrove plants have special adaptations such as stilt roots, viviparous germination, salt-excreting leaves, <b>breathing</b> <b>roots,</b> knee roots by which these plants survive in water logged anaerobic saline soils. The study of mangrove ecosystems in the deltaic region of Krishna river, particularly in Machilipatnam coastal region is very less and hence taken up. The data of the people in the selected field stations are gathered. The socio-economic status of the local inhabitants and their dependance on mangroves for their economic growth have been established...|$|R
40|$|Mangrove {{vegetation}} includes plants {{ranging from}} herbs, shrubs to tall trees. In favourable conditions the mangrove trees can form dense forests in intertidal habitats. However; {{only a few}} species form a massive canopy. The main characteristic features of these special type of plants are the tidal amplitude, defined by the species, {{and their ability to}} tolerate high salinity and stress. The majority of the plant groups have adaptations like prop and stilt roots for fixing support and the pneumatophores otherwise called the <b>breathing</b> <b>roots</b> for exchanging gases and the viviparous germination. In addition to these, the plants have leathery, dark, ever green leaves with deeply embeded stomata and aquous tissues...|$|R
5000|$|Syzygium maire, swamp maire, is an {{evergreen}} tree {{endemic to}} New Zealand. It is {{found throughout the}} North Island, {{and the top of}} the South Island. The Māori language name is [...] Swamp maire grows in wetlands, where it develops <b>breathing</b> <b>roots</b> in waterlogged soils, but is also tolerant of reasonably dry situations. The creamy-white flowers in autumn are followed by bright red drupes around 3 cm in length in late winter. The fruit are edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. The fruits are rich in antioxidants. Swamp maire is sold for use in gardens as an ornamental plant. It is not related to other species called maire, which are in the Nestegis genus.|$|R
500|$|Besides Jesselton, {{there are}} also other older names for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular is Api-Api, or simply Api, which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'. Wendy Law Suart wrote in her book on North Borneo, The Lingering Eye, [...] "there is in the Sabah State Museum a Dutch map of Borneo and the Celebes dated 1657 in which the {{settlement}} where Jesselton was to stand is clearly labelled Api Api. It may have some connection with the seaside tree with <b>breathing</b> <b>roots</b> that bears the same name". There are claims, however, that Kota Kinabalu was actually named after a nearby river called Sungai Api-Api. [...] In Chinese, the city is still known as 'Api', which is the Hakka pronunciation for 亚庇 (Simplified Chinese; Traditional Chinese: 亞庇; Pinyin: yà bì).|$|R
30|$|Mangroves {{are unique}} {{ecosystem}} exist along the sheltered inter-tidal coastline, {{in the margin}} between the land and sea in tropical and subtropical areas. This ecosystem endowed with productive wetland having flora and fauna adapted to local environment such as fluctuated water level, salinity and anoxic condition (Tomlinson 1986; Hutchings and Saenger 1987). They are most productive and biologically important ecosystems of the world which provide goods and services to human society in coastal and marine systems (FAO 2007). They have unique features such as aerial <b>breathing</b> <b>roots,</b> extensive supporting roots, buttresses, salt-excreting leaves and viviparous propagules (Duke 1992; Shi et al. 2006). The term ‘mangroves’ are referred to either individual plant or intertidal ecosystem or both, as ‘Mangrove plants’ and ‘Mangrove ecosystem’ (MacNae 1968). However, in this context we used mangrove term as a mangrove plants. Anthropogenic activity and climate are responsible for destruction of coastal mangroves vegetation. Globally among 11 of the 70 mangrove species were listed threatened species by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Polidoro et al. 2010).|$|R
50|$|Containers {{range from}} simple plastic pots, teacups to complex automatic-watering {{irrigation}} systems. This flexibility in design {{is another reason}} container gardening is popular with growers. They {{can be found on}} porches, front steps, and in urban locations, on rooftops. Sub-irrigated planters (SIP) are a type of container that may be used in container gardens. Potting material must be loose and allow drainage to offer proper aeration for <b>roots</b> to <b>breathe,</b> preventing <b>root</b> rot.|$|R
40|$|The {{claim that}} the {{herbicide}} Diuron in agricultural runoff caused dieback of the grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) in Central Queensland, Australia, has influenced government policies including programs to save the Great Barrier Reef. Several investigations on mangrove dieback in Central Queensland river estuaries have been published during the past decade. However, proof of a causal link between mangrove dieback and Diuron remains inconclusive. This study presents a systematic review of the evidence using Hill’s Criteria of Causation. Our review shows that using concentrations of the chemical bound to sediment as a measure for biological availability in either glasshouse or field studies is inappropriate. The appropriate measure is Diuron concentration in solution and this parameter bears no simple relationship to concentration bound to sediment, and is not strongly correlated with mangrove health. Only when the herbicide is applied in experimental investigations at many orders of magnitude higher than measured in rivers {{has an impact on}} A. marina been demonstrated. Evidence from field studies suggests burial of pneumatophores, the plant’s <b>breathing</b> <b>roots,</b> following flood events is a more likely causal factor in mangrove dieback, whereas any contribution from Diuron remains unproven...|$|R
50|$|Since {{almost all}} of the air {{circulation}} (transpiration) happens in the roots as does {{almost all of}} the energy production, the roots must be able to breathe easily. Overwatering will drown a typical houseplant. The air is pulled through the soil by the <b>breathing</b> of the <b>roots.</b> Air must be able to flow through the soil.|$|R
50|$|A {{methanol}} extract of {{the bark}} showed broad antifungal and antibacterial activity. The species {{is used as}} a malarial febrifuge. An infusion of the stem bark is used in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases and dysentery. A decoction of plant parts is drunk by children experiencing <b>breathing</b> difficulty. Its <b>roots</b> are used for snake bites and as a purgative.|$|R

Kung Fu together with lei tai trains the instincts and timing. It cultivates concentration and relaxation at the same time. It teaches practical combat applications of the disconnected moves learned from sets or Taolu ("Forms"). With lei tai a student receives personal feedback on their strengths and weaknesses.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} respiratory guidance system in 4 -dimensional computed tomography (4 DCT) based respiratory-gated radiation therapy (RGRT) by comparing respiratory signals and dosimetric analysis of treatment plans. Methods. The respiratory amplitude and period of the free, the audio device-guided, and the complex system-guided breathing were evaluated in eleven patients with lung or liver cancers. The dosimetric parameters were assessed by comparing free breathing CT plan and 4 DCT-based 30 – 70 % maximal intensity projection (MIP) plan. Results. The use of complex system-guided breathing showed significantly less variation in respiratory amplitude and period compared to the free or audio-guided <b>breathing</b> regarding the <b>root</b> mean square errors (RMSE) of full inspiration (P= 0. 031), full expiration (P= 0. 007), and period (P= 0. 007). The dosimetric parameters including V 5 [*]Gy, V 10 [*]Gy, V 20 [*]Gy, V 30 [*]Gy, V 40 [*]Gy, and V 50 [*]Gy of normal liver or lung in 4 DCT MIP plan were superior over free breathing CT plan. Conclusions. The reproducibility and regularity of respiratory amplitude and period were significantly improved with the complex system-guided breathing compared to the free or the audio-guided breathing. In addition, the treatment plan based on the 4 D CT-based MIP images acquired with the complex system guided breathing showed better normal tissue sparing than that on the free breathing CT...|$|R
