In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E
500|$|Although Wollstonecraft {{initially}} felt {{proud of}} Mary, {{a decade after}} its publication she no longer believed that the work aptly demonstrated her talents as an author; she wrote to Everina in 1797: [...] "as for my Mary, I consider it as a crude production, and do not very willingly {{put it in the}} way of people whose good opinion, as a writer, I wish for; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> have it to make up the sum of laughter". Wollstonecraft's husband, William Godwin, disagreed, however, in his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: ...|$|E
500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling. You may not walk on water after hearing it, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> want to get your focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{how long it}} took for Gosling to inform Franklin at Birkbeck, but her original 17 March B-DNA manuscript does not reflect any knowledge of the Cambridge model. Franklin did modify this draft later before publishing it as the third in the trio of 25 April 1953 Nature articles. On 18 March, in response to receiving a copy of their preliminary manuscript, Wilkins penned the following: [...] "I think you're a couple of old rogues, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> well have something".|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Peter Bradshaw concurred: [...] "Even as a non-believer in {{this kind}} of [...] "sung-through" [...] musical, I was {{battered}} into submission by this mesmeric and sometimes compelling film ...". Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying that the film [...] "is a clutch player that delivers an emotional wallop when it counts. You can walk into the theater as an agnostic, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> just leave singing with the choir." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Besides being a feast for the eyes and ears, Les Misérables overflows with humor, heartbreak, rousing action and ravishing romance. Damn the imperfections, it's perfectly marvelous." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Didascalia of the Apostles is the {{earliest}} document that specifically discusses {{the role of}} the male and female deacons more at length. It originated in Aramaic speaking Syria during the 3rd century, but soon spread in Greek and Latin versions. In it the author urges the bishop: [...] "Appoint a woman for the ministry of women. For there are homes to which you cannot send a male deacon to their women, on account of the heathen, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> send a deaconess... Also in many other matters the office of a woman deacon is required." [...] The bishop should look on the man who is a deacon as Christ and the woman who is a deacon as the Holy Spirit, denoting their prominent place in the church hierarchy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> have a little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of}} your ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
2500|$|Of her quotable comments, Alice's {{most famous}} {{found its way}} to a pillow on her settee: [...] "If you can't say {{something}} good about someone, come sit right here by me." [...] To Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had jokingly remarked at a party [...] "Here's my blind date. I am going to call you Alice," [...] she sarcastically said [...] "Senator McCarthy, {{you are not going to}} call me Alice. The truckman, the trashman and the policeman on my block may call me Alice, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not." [...] She informed President Lyndon B. Johnson that she wore wide-brimmed hats so he couldn't kiss her. When a well-known Washington senator was discovered to have been having an affair with a young woman less than half his age, she quipped, [...] "You can't make a soufflé rise twice." [...] She said in a 60 Minutes interview with Eric Sevareid, televised on February 17, 1974, that she was a hedonist.|$|E
2500|$|On December 23, 1783, the State of New Jersey {{presented}} him {{with the use of}} an estate in Bergen County now known as Steuben House, which had been confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie in 1781. Located in the formerly strategic New Bridge Landing, the estate included a gristmill and about 40 acres of land. Legislators initially conditioned the grant, requiring Steuben to [...] "hold, occupy and enjoy the said estate in person, and not by tenant." [...] Gen. Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey Militia informed the baron of this gift and responded to his inquiries that [...] "there are on the premises an exceeding good House, an excellent barn, together with many useful outbuildings, all of which I am told, want some repairs...there is...a Grist-mill; a good Orchard, some meadow Ground, & plenty of Wood. The distance from N York by land 15 miles, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> keep a boat & go from your own door to N York by water—Oysters, Fish & wild fowl in abundance—Possession will be given to you in the Spring, when you will take a view of the premises." [...] Von Steuben spent considerable sums to repair wartime damages to the house and restore its commercial operations under former aide Walker.|$|E
