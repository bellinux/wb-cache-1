As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and was often very modest.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the second}} time trial stage, with long {{straight}} stretches, some beautiful sections of unbending road and some slight inclines (with one located about 600 m to the finish line). It was clear that time-trial specialists would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> After an impressive performance during the Pyrenees crossing and the capture of the yellow jersey due to Michael Rasmussen's dismissal, Alberto Contador expressed his concerns about being beaten in the final time trial of the competition. Before the riders located above the 20th place started, Belgian Leif Hoste set a time of 1h 05' 32", making him the 1st ranked rider of the stage {{for a long period of}} time. Nonetheless, with the start of the favourites for the stage, he gradually went down through the standings, finishing in 9th position. David Millar, who was expected to be a contender for victory, experienced mechanical trouble, needing to change bikes twice within the first kilometer.|$|E

[...] Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She said that it was a [...] "teenager ... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do, and was [...] "out of place" [...] in the show: [...] "I was really surprised. I didn't know anything about it. I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, but to me there was such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{an account}} {{published}} by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted {{of his own}} heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and claimed he had eaten a baby raw. Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone, which he reiterated {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, in spite of their circumstances {{and the fact that he}} eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners. [...] Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of [...] "common adolescent desires to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and to shock one's elders"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton. Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion [...] "extravagant moralism", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices. Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, [...] "more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening night}} of the tour {{received}} generally positive reviews: USA Todays Erica K. Landau praised the Miami concert, summarizing it as [...] " [...] tantalizing spectacle, [...] triumphant vocals, palpable sensuality and booty-shaking anthems". She further described the performance as integrated adding that, [...] "the coordination is not just remarkable, it's the absolute best way {{that two of the}} world's best performers can deliver a show that proves why they're on top together". MTV News editor Rebecca Thomas praised the duo's united performance, adding that they demonstrated how to share a stage, [...] "egos aside: They toggled, repeatedly, and mostly seamlessly from one megastar catalog to the other and took fan-favorites in surprising new directions — ones that imbued them with pathos that hadn't been there before." [...] Miami New Times Kat Bein felt that the chemistry between the couple was not what it could have been, with Beyoncé reportedly shaking off Jay-Z's kisses or turning away during his [...] "doting playfulness", however Bein added that this could have been merely a playful act for the stage. She felt that potential [...] "witty banter" [...] between the couple was lost {{with the use of the}} video pieces between the songs. Jon Caramanica in a review for The New York Times opined that each entertainer gave the other the opportunity to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> while acknowledging their different types of success. He concluded [...] "Jay-Z allowed for breezy enjoyment; Beyoncé demanded full and reverent attention".|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} gained widespread {{attention from}} the media after M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera {{near the end of}} her verse instead of singing the word [...] "shit". Media criticized M.I.A. for the gesture and compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. People said, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction?

She felt that it was a [...] "teenager... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do during the show, since it was [...] "out of place". Brian McCarthy, spokesman for the NFL said, [...] "Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers. The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans." [...] McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals, M.I.A. improvised it on stage. [...] The league later fined the rapper a total of $16.6 million as penalty, which was resolved through a confidential agreement in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Guiteau became {{something}} of a media sensation during his entire trial for his bizarre behavior, which included him frequently cursing and insulting the judge, most of the witnesses, the prosecution, and even his defense team, as well as formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He dictated an autobiography to the New York Herald, ending it with a personal ad for [...] "a nice Christian lady under 30 years of age". He was oblivious to the American public's hatred of him, even after he was almost assassinated twice himself. He frequently smiled and waved at spectators and reporters {{in and out of}} the courtroom, seemingly happy to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> for once in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Albini also {{emphasized}} that the songs' lyrics were not {{the focal point of}} Big Black, and that the vocals were only there out of necessity: [...] "It seemed like, as instrumental music, it didn't have enough emotional intensity at times, so there would be vocals. But the vocals were not intended to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> — the interaction within the band and the chaotic nature of the music, that was the important part." [...] However, he did enjoy testing the tolerance of the white liberal hipsters in his audience and provoking reactions out of listeners, stating that one of the band's goals was [...] "to have pointedly offensive records". Terri Sutton of Puncture magazine wrote that the band's stark presentation of evil, deep-seated human impulses bolstered their work against criticism: [...] "The topics are so deliberately loaded that you can't criticize their 'art' without looking like some fucking puritan." ...|$|E

Liz confesses to Jenna, [...] "there's still this sad little {{part of me that}} wants to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> ... that wants to be you, I guess". Liz gets the chance to be on camera as host of Dealbreakers, but the pilot is a failure. Despite their frustrations and occasional rivalries, however, the show often reveals that the two women appreciate their friendship and do their best to be supportive of the other's careers. [...] When the phrase [...] "That's a deal breaker, ladies" [...] is coined by Jenna thanks to Liz's writing, Jenna surrenders the spotlight with a surprisingly short sulking period. [...] She later encourages Liz to write a book and take on a talk show gig based on the catch phrase (though the talk show is very short-lived).|$|E
