25|$|Recent {{surveys have}} {{consistently}} found that roughly {{one third of}} organizations use generic office software to report their <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard,</b> one third used software developed specifically for their own use, and one third used {{one of the many}} commercial packages available.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that the <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and non-financial topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} phenomenon of <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecards</b> {{in the context of}} the public sector in Brunei Darussalam. <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecards</b> has become a popular mechanism in Performance Management and Measurement System to date and has been applied in the private and public sectors of many countries. Nevertheless, despite its popularity, little is known about the role of <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecards</b> in the context of this present study and this research simply adds value to that body of knowledge. This research is guided by an interpretive methodology and is carried out by using Grounded Theory procedures (Strauss and Corbin, 1990, 1998). Two of Brunei’s government ministries have been purposely chosen to participate in this research project. The substantive grounded theory proposed that discretionary engagement is the core activity underpinning the <b>Balance</b> <b>Scorecards</b> process. Discretionary engagement essentially deals with the process of loose alignment or disconnection involving the higher-level directions, and the respective departmental strategic responses, in relation to the ministerial- level <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecards</b> strategic goals. The core phenomenon emerged from the contextual interactions of both external and internal conditioners. The effects of two internal causal conditioners are mediated by the departmental response strategies which then become an essential part of the discretionary engagement process. The impact of this core activity has undermined the initial purpose of the overall <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecards</b> strategy development and has, in turn, caused a variety of unintended consequences. The rich insights gained from the present study are primarily filling the research gap in both interpretive research, via Grounded theory procedures, and <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecards</b> knowledge in the public sector environment, by conducting the research in unexplored social setting. This study also essentially contributed to the theorising of decoupling of Performance Management and Measurement System {{in the context of the}} public sector, in the realm of New Institutional Theory of Sociology...|$|R

25|$|Design of a <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> {{is about}} the {{identification}} of {{a small number of}} financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'.

2500|$|The phrase 'balanced scorecard' {{primarily}} {{refers to}} a performance management report used by a management team, and typically this team is focused on managing {{the implementation of a}} strategy or operational activities - in a recent survey 62% of respondents reported using <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> for strategy implementation management, 48% for operational management. [...] <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> is also used by individuals to track personal performance, but this is less common - only 17% of respondents in the survey using <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> in this way, however {{it is clear from the}} same survey that a larger proportion (about 30%) use corporate <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> elements to inform personal goal setting and incentive calculations.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{structural}} variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004 attempted to identify a pattern in these variations – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared {{to be part of}} an evolution of the <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as [...] "generations". [...] Broadly, the original 'measures in four boxes' type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan & Norton) constitutes the 1st generation <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> design; <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> designs that include a 'strategy map' or 'strategic linkage model' (e.g. the Performance Prism, later Kaplan & Norton designs the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy & Wetter (English translation 1999, 1st published in Swedish 1997)) constitute the 2nd Generation of <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> design; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a separate document describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the [...] "destination statement" [...] idea) comprise the 3rd generation <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> design.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the title}} of Kaplan and Norton's second book highlights, even by 2000 the focus of {{attention}} among thought-leaders was moving from the design of Balanced Scorecards themselves, towards the use of <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> as a focal point within a more comprehensive strategic management system. [...] Subsequent writing on <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> by Kaplan & Norton has focused on uses of <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> rather than its design (e.g. [...] "The Execution Premium" [...] in 2008), however many others have continued to refine the device itself (e.g. Abernethy et al.).|$|E
2500|$|Theorists {{have argued}} from the {{earliest}} days of discussion of <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> usage that much of the benefit of the <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> comes from the design process itself. [...] Indeed, it is argued that many failures {{in the early days of}} <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants - it is suggested that by not being involved in the design, the relevant managers who were to use the device did not trust, and so failed to engage with and use the devices.|$|E

40|$|Concerning the {{competition}} of universities in Indonesia, a research about the measurement and quality control from strategic perspectives will pose an interesting subject to be explored. The high-pressure {{of the economic}} condition, the unstable political environment, the globalization era {{as well as the}} unfair competition has changed the business environment. As a result, performance measures are used to guide the managers 2 ̆ 7 decision and to evaluate the performance of managers and their units. This measurement is used as guidelines and incentives to facilitate the coordination among managers and business unit goals with those of the overall corporate goals. Without the performance measurement system, companies will probably move to a wrong decision. One of the tools that can provide comprehensive, coherent and balance performance measures is <b>Balance</b> <b>Scorecard.</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Scorecard</b> does not only provide comprehensive measures(financial, Customer, Internal Business Process, and Learning & Growth), but is also provide a road map about how to achieve financial objectives without sacrificing long term performance. The Faculty of Economics of Satya Wacana Christian University (F-E SWCU), as one of the private universities in Indonesia, must also formulate and implement strategies that will fit with the high turbulent business environment. To avoid a pitfall of financial performance, FE SWCU have to implement <b>Balance</b> <b>Scorecard.</b> The <b>Balance</b> <b>Scorecard</b> designed for FE SWCU consists of strategic objectives derived from company vision mission, outcome measures and performance driver measures, and targets as milestones to know achievement of strategic objectives of the company...|$|R
2500|$|These {{suggestions}} were notably {{triggered by}} a recognition that different but equivalent headings would yield alternative sets of measures, and this represents the major design challenge faced {{with this type of}} <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> design: justifying the choice of measures made. [...] "Of all the measures you could have chosen, why did you choose these?" [...] These issues contribute to dis-satisfaction with early <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> designs, since if users are not confident that the measures within the <b>Balanced</b> <b>Scorecard</b> are well chosen, they will have less confidence in the information it provides.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{modified}} version of <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> design, managers select a few strategic objectives {{within each of the}} perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a [...] "strategic linkage model". [...] A <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective. [...] This type of approach provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through. [...] This style of <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so {{can be thought of as}} representing the [...] "2nd generation" [...] of design approach adopted for <b>balanced</b> <b>scorecard</b> since its introduction.|$|E
