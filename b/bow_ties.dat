5000|$|<b>Bow</b> <b>Tie</b> Cigar Company's {{branding}} {{focuses on}} the <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> as a central theme. The banding on all their products is created {{in the shape of}} a <b>bow</b> <b>tie.</b> Different blends are created in different colors, with the current cigar line focusing on metallic bands. The company uses the image of a <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> to create a memorable label that can be recognized by the image and color of the <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> alone. [...] The <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> also appears on cigar boxes, packaging, and cutters. The concept of using the <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> stems from Billie King Jr.'s favorite accessory. [...] Billie King Jr. said, [...] "I injected my personality into as many aspects of my business as possible. This is evident from the cigar bands to the website design, to the all-inclusive packaging concept, and my moniker. <b>Bow</b> <b>Tie</b> Cigars is me, and I am <b>Bow</b> <b>Tie</b> Cigars." [...] The use of the <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> as a central theme is also seen in the company's slogan, [...] "What color is your bow tie?".|$|R

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2004, Bhakta {{appeared}} on the second season of the business-oriented reality television show, The Apprentice. On the show, Bhakta propositioned Anna Kournikova and Donald Trump's assistant {{to go out with}} him on dates, and was fired by Trump on the ninth week of the show. His relationships with women became fodder for gossip columns such as New York Posts Page Six, and his frequent wearing of <b>bow</b> <b>ties</b> was credited with a surge in bow tie sales.|$|E
25|$|What's My Line? {{is known}} for its {{attention}} to manners and class. In its early years, business suits and street dresses were worn by the host and panelists, but by 1953, the men normally wore black suits with <b>bow</b> <b>ties</b> (a few guests in fact wore tuxedos) while female panelists donned formal gowns and often gloves. Exceptions to this dress code were on the broadcasts immediately following the deaths of Fred Allen and Dorothy Kilgallen, in which the male cast members wore straight neckties and the women wore simpler dresses.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{different}} vein, much later, in the 1980s, a talented generation of players revived the club's spirit. They carried {{it back to the}} top of French rugby thanks to their performances on the pitch, but they also wanted to bring the fun back into the game, to take rugby out of its Parisian anonymity. They did so through a combination of serious football, humour and self-mockery. Their famous antics were invented by the club's backs (including France flyhalf Franck Mesnel and France wing Jean-Baptiste Lafond) who once played a game in Bayonne with berets on their heads as a tribute to the tradition of attacking play of the Basque club Aviron Bayonnais (11 Jan 1987). As members of a gang which they called le show bizz, they played other matches with black make-up on (10 April 1988 at Stade Toulousain), hair dyed yellow, bald caps (26 Feb 1989 against Béziers), wigs and even dressed up as pelote players (white shirts, black jackets and berets, again) in March 1990 at Biarritz Olympique. In April 1989, they wore long red and white striped shorts to celebrate the sans-culotte who took the Bastille on 14 July 1789. They wore long white trousers to look like players of old in the French championship semi-final on 26 April 1987—and won. Their best prank was in the next game though: they played the 1987 final against Toulon with a pink bow tie (2 May). Just before kick-off, Lafond presented French president François Mitterrand, who always attended the national final, with one of those <b>bow</b> <b>ties.</b> They lost that match but went on to play the 1990 final with the same <b>bow</b> <b>ties.</b> At half-time, they had a drink of champagne on the pitch to recover from the efforts of the first half—and won what proved to be the club's last top-flight title for a quarter-century.|$|E

25|$|The Black Arts Movement, a {{cultural}} {{explosion of the}} 1960s, saw the incorporation of surviving cultural dress with elements from modern fashion and West African traditional clothing to create a uniquely African-American traditional style. Kente cloth is the best known African textile. These festive woven patterns, which exist in numerous varieties, were originally made by the Ashanti and Ewe peoples of Ghana and Togo. Kente fabric also appears {{in a number of}} Western style fashions ranging from casual T-shirts to formal <b>bow</b> <b>ties</b> and cummerbunds. Kente strips are often sewn into liturgical and academic robes or worn as stoles. Since the Black Arts Movement, traditional African clothing has been popular amongst African Americans for both formal and informal occasions. Other manifestations of traditional African dress in common evidence in African-American culture are vibrant colors, mud cloth, trade beads and the use of Adinkra motifs in jewelry and in couture and decorator fabrics.|$|E
500|$|The team {{signed with}} the WWF and took on the new name Well Dunn, with Doll {{competing}} as Steven Dunn and King wrestling under the name Timothy Well. They wore <b>bow</b> <b>ties</b> in addition to wrestling singlets with thongs over top. This led wrestling author RD Reynolds to state that the team was [...] "proof positive that <b>bow</b> <b>ties</b> and thongs do not match". The team made its WWF television debut on the July 18, 1993 episode of All-American Wrestling, teaming with Blake Beverly in a loss to Tatanka and The Steiner Brothers. They continued to face the WWF's top face (fan favorite) tag teams, including The Smoking Gunns and Men on a Mission.|$|E

500|$|Within World Dance Council {{international}} competitions are {{two categories}} of dances, Ballroom (also called Standard or Modern) and Latin. In England (e.g. at the Blackpool Dance Festival), the categories are traditionally called Ballroom and Latin American dances respectively. In the Ballroom dances, men typically wear evening dress (coattails, waistcoats and white <b>bow</b> <b>ties),</b> while women wear gowns. Partners remain in closed position throughout the dance, and movements tend to be elegant and sweeping. The ballroom dances are progressive, moving anti-clockwise round the floor.|$|E
500|$|Jack Benny invited {{longtime}} friend, writer, and performer Goodman Ace {{to lunch}} {{with him at}} the Stork. Ace arrived at the club first and received the [...] "cold shoulder" [...] because he was not recognized by the staff. When Benny arrived and asked for Ace, he was told that Ace became tired of waiting and left. Soon Ace began to receive mail from the Stork, which he proceeded to answer in his tongue in cheek style. [...] Ace's response to the message about the club having wonderful air conditioning was that after having received the cold shoulder there, he was well aware of the climate. Bilingsley responded to Ace with a gift of some Stork Club <b>bow</b> <b>ties.</b> Ace then asked for some matching socks so he might be in style to be turned away again. Ace and his wife became regulars at the club after the issue was resolved.|$|E
500|$|While in {{his first}} several Doctor Who appearances, Jack {{did not have a}} set costume, Torchwood {{established}} a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as [...] "an iconic piece of sci-fi culture". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: [...] "I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and <b>bow</b> <b>ties</b> and Stetsons. The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just is." [...] In fact, in her essay [...] "Fashioning Masculinity and Desire", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse [...] "through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows".|$|E

2500|$|Bow ties: <b>Bow</b> <b>ties</b> {{have always}} {{provided}} {{an alternative to}} neckties, and even preceded the necktie. <b>Bow</b> <b>ties</b> are even regarded, arguably, as more formal or dressy than neckties, especially when worn with suits. During the [...] "powerdressing," [...] or [...] "dress for success" [...] days of the 1980s, <b>bow</b> <b>ties,</b> though in the minority, certainly had {{their share of the}} business and professional fashion market. This included women professionals, who wore a slightly fuller version of the bow tie with the skirt suits and buttoned-up blouses popular in the business world. <b>Bow</b> <b>ties,</b> for professional men or women, typically were the same fabrics, colours, and patterns as neckties.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bow</b> <b>tie</b> [...] {{is a type}} of {{traditional}} necktie.

2500|$|The {{center of}} the cornea shows normal thickness, with an intact central epithelium, but the {{inferior}} cornea exhibits a peripheral band of thinning, to about 1–2mm. [...] The portion of the cornea that is immediately adjacent to the limbus is spared, usually a strip of about 1–2mm.

Some include white shirts, black <b>bow</b> <b>ties,</b> and low-cut waistcoats, while others feature high collars that fasten around the neck and corresponding high-gorge waistcoats. [...] Some nations' armed services have black tie and white tie equivalent variants in their mess dress.|$|E
