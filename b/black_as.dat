40|$|The author {{explored}} {{the meaning of}} the Black community according to a purposeful sample of 60 Black adults in the mid-Atlantic United States. Purposeful stratified sampling resulted in equal numbers of participants along the lines of locale (Brooklyn, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D. C.), gender, and generational affiliation (older adults, middle-aged adults, and young adults). Content analysis of responses to a single open-ended survey question resulted in 11 emergent themes around {{the meaning of the}} Black community: the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> cultural, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> residential, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> global, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> supportive, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> visibly distinctive, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> socioeconomic, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nonactualized, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nondifferential, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nihilistic, the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> nondefinable, and the <b>Black</b> community <b>as</b> other. Gender and generational variations in thematic endorsement were analyzed, and implications of these findings as they pertain to research, mental health programs, and policies for Blacks are discussed...|$|R

5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark <b>black</b> (<b>as</b> in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or <b>black,</b> <b>as</b> many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E

5|$|Differences {{occur in}} pelage colouration, {{ranging from a}} pale white (as in the Arabian oryx) to <b>black</b> (<b>as</b> in the black wildebeest). However, only the {{intermediate}} shades, such as brown and reddish brown (as in the reedbuck), are commonly observed. In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the wildebeest, the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the addax, the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.|$|E
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, <b>black,</b> <b>as</b> well as bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
