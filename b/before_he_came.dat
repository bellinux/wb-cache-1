5|$|Beresford visited several {{schools and}} auditioned many {{children}} {{for the role of}} Sonny <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based on a simple, rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed that his father was killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny's was in the film's backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard's father had died until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo's on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often play guitar with Duvall during breaks from filming.|$|E
5|$|Michael Hart {{arrived in}} Lyttelton {{with his wife}} and their two sons on the Cressy on 27 December 1850, one of the First Four Ships {{reaching}} Canterbury. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out to New Zealand, he had been a plumber. Hart founded the White Hart on the corner of High and Cashel Streets, the first hotel in Christchurch. The hotel opened on 15 November 1851, {{less than a year after}} the organised settlement of Christchurch. In December 1852, Hart catered for 150 guests who had assembled to farewell John Robert Godley, the founder of Canterbury who returned to England after his short stay in the colony. A well-known man, Hart had no political experience; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council.|$|E
5|$|War at the Warfield is {{a concert}} video by Slayer which was {{released}} on July 29, 2003, through American Recordings. Recorded at Warfield Theatre in San Francisco, California, on December 7, 2001, it is the band's second video album. The DVD's contents were announced by MTV on July 25, 2003. It is the last release by Slayer with drummer Paul Bostaph (<b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> back in 2013), who left due to a chronic elbow injury. Bostaph was subsequently replaced by the original Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. War at the Warfield was well received by critics, debuting at number three on the Billboard DVD chart, and sold over 7,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over 50,000 copies in the United States. It also won a 2003 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for DVD of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Æthelberht {{was the son}} of Eormenric, {{succeeding}} him as king, {{according to}} the Chronicle. He married Bertha, the Christian daughter of Charibert, king of the Franks, thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in contemporary Western Europe; the marriage probably took place <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the throne. Bertha's influence may have led to Pope Gregory I's decision to send Augustine as a missionary from Rome. Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet in east Kent in 597. Shortly thereafter, Æthelberht converted to Christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom. He provided the new church with land in Canterbury, thus establishing one of the foundation stones of what ultimately became the Anglican Communion.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{endured a}} poor {{start to the}} 1971–72 season, {{and as a result}} Mee {{purchased}} Alan Ball, Jr. from Everton for £220,000. They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points. They were knocked out of the European Cup at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Ajax. They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted Derby County the league title by denying Liverpool what would have proved to be a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season. Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1–0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as a substitute for the final <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on for Radford after 73 minutes. Kennedy scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the club's top goalscorer for the second successive season.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got around}} the outside of Hamilton in turn one, while Räikkönen lost {{positions}} due to a slow getaway. Sebastian Vettel got past Verstappen, but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four. At {{the front of the}} race, coming out of turn three, Hamilton tried to retake the position from Rosberg. As the latter defended his position, Hamilton went off the track and spun and they collided at turn 4, ending the race of both Mercedes drivers. The collision resulted in a safety car period, with the order standing: Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Vettel and Räikkönen. The safety car came in at the end of lap four. Vettel got past Sainz on lap eight and Räikkönen tried to follow suit two laps later, but was forced off track into turn two. He completed the move one lap later at the same spot. Sainz and Button were the first to come into the pit lane for new tyres on lap 12, followed by race leader Ricciardo one lap later, making Verstappen the first Dutchman to lead a Grand Prix, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in another lap later. When Vettel made a pit stop on lap 16, he emerged third behind the two Red Bull drivers, all on the medium compound tyre.|$|E

5|$|John de Vieuxpont died in 1241, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> of age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was not {{old enough}} to inherit, so the family's lands {{remained}} in wardship. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont {{came of age in}} around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King HenryIII. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the shrievalty of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.|$|E

25|$|In September 1963, Mitchell {{unexpectedly}} took early retirement, due {{to health}} reasons, at age 58, after 24 years service. He had {{announced that he}} would do so <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> under suspicion. But he was later interrogated, in 1968, and seemingly was able to answer the charges successfully. The main suspicion then fell on Hollis and, although the matter has never been completely resolved, Christopher Andrew in his Authorised History of MI5 comes to a firm conclusion that neither were traitors. Pincher, conversely, believes that Hollis was the most likely culprit, if there was one.|$|E
25|$|<b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Strasbourg in the {{beginning}} of the 1440s, Heinrich Eggestein had already acquired the academic degree of a Magister artium liberalium at a university which is still unknown. Already shortly after his arrival, he entered the service of Bishop Ruprecht von Pfalz-Simmern and held the office of Siegelbewahrer (keeper of the seal, also called Insiegler or Siegelträger) at the Strasbourg provost court, which he lost again in 1455. In 1461, this office was again given to him and three years later, he finally lost it.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{was born}} in the Algiers {{neighborhood}} of New Orleans. He joined the newly established U.S. Air Force when he was seventeen and was assigned to the U.S. Signal Corps in a job involving surveillance. He was stationed for a time in Panama City, Panama. He lived in numerous cities <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Minden early in 1987. On discharge from the Air Force, Brown worked for a detective agency in Houston, Texas. In the middle 1960s, he joined the staff of Motorola in Shreveport. He was thereafter transferred to other locations, including Biloxi in Harrison County, Mississippi, where he sold two-way radios.|$|E
25|$|The Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, {{located in}} Melkote built on rocky hills is a square {{building}} of large dimensions but very plain, dedicated to Lord Cheluva-Narayana Swamy or Tirunarayana. Mysore Archaeological Department states, {{on the strength}} of epigraphic evidence, that the presiding deity of this temple was already a well known idol of worship before Sri Ramanujacharya, the Srivaishnava saint worshipped at the shrine in December 1098 and even <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the Mysore region and that very probably he used his influence to rebuild or renovate the temple. The temple is richly endowed, having been under the special patronage of the Mysore Wodeyars, and has a most valuable collection of jewels.|$|E
25|$|Cavour {{put forth}} several {{economic}} reforms {{in his native}} region of Piedmont in his earlier years, and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies through a union of left-center and right-center politicians. After a large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in 1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way through the Crimean War, the Second Italian War of Independence, and Garibaldi's expeditions, managing to maneuver Piedmont diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to power.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to power, Hitler {{was often}} portrayed satirically in {{newspaper}} cartoons and propaganda by political enemies. The photomontagist John Heartfield regularly depicted Hitler in absurd ways in his anti-Nazi poster designs. When the Nazis came to national power in January 1933, Hitler was mostly {{depicted as a}} god-like figure, loved and respected by the German people, as shown for example in Triumph of the Will, which Hitler co-produced. An exception was the German movie Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (The Testament of Dr. Mabuse) from 1933, which was banned by the Nazi propaganda ministry. Many critics consider Fritz Lang's depiction of a homicidal maniac masterminding a criminal empire from {{within the walls of}} a criminal asylum to be an allegory of the Nazi ascent to power in Germany.|$|E
25|$|More recently, two of Herbert's earlier {{compositions}} for cello {{and orchestra}} have regained {{a place in}} the concert repertory. The Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3 (1884), his earliest known composition despite its designation as Op. 3, has been performed by several ensembles in recent years. The work foreshadows the light music of Herbert's later compositions. Another work that has been revived is his Cello Concerto No. 1, which was first performed by the composer in Stuttgart shortly <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the U.S. For many years, the work was unpublished and apparently unperformed, surviving only in manuscript. It was recorded {{for the first time in}} 1986 and has since been published. The composition is admired for achieving an effective balance between its virtuosic elements and its lyricism.|$|E
