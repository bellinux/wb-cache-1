5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels {{began the}} 1997 college {{football}} season having gone 102 in 1996, {{a year that}} ended with a 2013 win over West Virginia in the 1997 Gator Bowl. Hopes were high for the Tar Heels heading into the 1997 season, with some writers and fans picking North Carolina {{to have a chance}} to compete for the national championship. The Tar Heels <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> those hopes in the first game of the season, beating Big Ten opponent Indiana, 236.|$|E

25|$|The Dublin Council {{may have}} been right: O'Neill <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> its fears by {{stripping}} food and horses from the lands bordering the Pale (an area around Dublin traditionally loyal to crown government). The rebel leader then encouraged a rebellion by the White Knight in the southern province of Munster, while O'Donnell moved into the western province of Connacht, with the expectation O'Neill would push south to join with the White Knight. War was in preparation at every point of the compass.|$|E

25|$|The Talos Principle <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> from Croteam's work towards first-person shooter Serious Sam 4, {{experimenting with}} the use of {{interactive}} objects as part of the game design while creating levels that fit within the Serious Sam design style. This led to some complicated puzzles that the team was inspired to build upon further as a separate title. Croteam designed the general world setting and outline of the story, and then brought two writers on board, Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, who consulted on narrative design and philosophy on the bases of transhumanism and other important questions about humanity.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{six months}} he spent writing Perceptions (see below), Johnson entered the studio for a date with André Previn's trio (adding Johnson as the only horn). They {{recorded}} an entire album of the music of Kurt Weill. The inventive arrangements and inspired playing of both stars on Andre Previn and J.J. Johnson Play 'Mack The Knife' and Other Kurt Weill Songs <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> the producer's foresight, yet this recording was not released on CD until after his death. In 1962 Johnson toured {{for a number of}} months with Davis' sextet of that year, which went unrecorded.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Holtz and Blaschko it {{was clear}} that animals {{synthesized}} noradrenaline. What was lacking to attribute a transmitter role to it was proof of its presence in tissues at effective concentrations and not only as a short-lived intermediate. On April 16, 1945, Ulf von Euler of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, who had already discovered or co-discovered substance P and prostaglandins, submitted to Nature {{the first of a series}} of papers that gave this proof. After many bioassays and chemical assays on organ extracts he concluded that mammalian sympathetically innervated tissues as well as, in small amounts, the brain, but not the nerve-free placenta, contained noradrenaline and that noradrenaline was the sympathin of Cannon and Rosenblueth, the ″physiological transmitter of adrenergic nerve action in mammals″. Overflow of noradrenaline into the venous blood of the cat’s spleen upon sympathetic nerve stimulation two years later <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> the conclusion. In amphibian hearts, on the other hand, the transmitter role of adrenaline was confirmed.|$|E

25|$|That Dragon, Cancer <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> from {{experiences}} that Ryan and Amy Green had after their third child Joel {{was diagnosed with}} an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor at twelve months of age, around November 2010. The doctors had only given the child about four months to live, but despite developing seven additional tumors, Joel continued to live for four more years. Joel's condition left him mentally underdeveloped, being unable to speak even by age 2, and he required additional parental care and supervision, alongside numerous visits to doctors and hospitals for palliative care and chemotherapy treatment. In early 2014, Joel's condition worsened, and the Greens temporarily moved from Colorado to San Francisco {{to take part in}} an experimental drug trial. The new drug failed to relieve any of the new symptoms. Ryan and Amy, following the advice of the hospice, decided to take him off his feeding tube, and he died on March 13, 2014 at the age of five.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1854 she {{was offered}} the title role in a new opera by Charles Gounod, La nonne sanglante, but {{declined}} it. The role was instead offered to Palmyre Wertheimber, a new singer from the Opéra-Comique who had made her debut at the Opéra as Fidès in Le prophète and was much admired and praised by Théophile Gautier. Cruvelli, meanwhile, returned to London for engagements at Covent Garden, where she sang Desdemona in Rossini's Otello (with Antonio Tamburini and Giorgio Ronconi), Leonore (in Fidelio) and Donna Anna (Don Giovanni). Chorley, who never admired her, called it 'an inroad, the result of which in no respect <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> her popularity in the Haymarket.' She {{then went back to}} Paris to sing Alice in Robert le diable, and through that summer and autumn was the reigning goddess at the Opéra. She was required to sing only two nights a week and was receiving a very substantial fee for each performance. By autumn, rehearsals were under way for a new Verdi opera written specially for her, Les vêpres Siciliennes. Her performance of Les Huguenots , scheduled for the beginning of October 1854, was eagerly awaited.|$|E
25|$|Psyonix had {{previously}} developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder, Dave Hagewood, {{had done for}} Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle-based gameplay that Epic Games had already set {{in place in the}} engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. For this, Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects, Psyonix worked {{to try to find a}} way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics-based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes, but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles, they had hit upon the right formula, which would become Battle-Cars. Further to the success was the addition of the rocket-powered cars; this originally was to be a simple speed boost, but with the physics engine, they were able to have the vehicles fly off and around the arena, furthering the possibilities for gameplay.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} season – {{one with}} hardly {{a day of}} rain in the Home Counties after early May – <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> almost all that was thought of Knox. When sound, he was clearly the fastest bowler seen {{for a long time}} in county cricket and, even on much truer Oval pitches, he was able to make the ball rise dangerously. He could also spin the ball back from the off as much as Richardson at his best. Early in the season, Knox’s bowling was beyond everything else the factor behind Surrey rising to the top of the table, and at times – notably against Leicestershire and Sussex at the Oval – his pace could bowl sides out cheaply on even the best of pitches. However, from the middle of June, the strain of bowling on such hard, sun-soaked pitches took its toll and Knox suffered constantly from shin strains. These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey’s last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox “often played when he should have been resting.” Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered as perhaps the fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games: some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated. Knox was rewarded for this and his superb early season form with nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E
500|$|Toru Iwatani, head of {{research}} and development for Namco, stated that the idea for Katamari Damacy resulted from Keita Takahashi's school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory, a sponsored institute for game development education. Keita Takahashi's final thesis <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> the core gameplay ideas, while a team of ten (including the student) developed the final product. [...] The game was developed for less than US$1million, a tenth of the cost of Namco blockbuster titles such as Ridge Racer or Soulcalibur. [...] The game took {{a year and a half}} to develop, with eight months of prototyping.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes was the decision to <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> the over-sized 40.6cm guns to 42cm caliber for the H-41 design. The design staff determined that modifications to the ammunition hoists and loading equipment would be easily effected and that the original turrets could be retained. The OKM was aware that the British had settled on a 40.6cm gun for the proposed the 42cm gun would grant the H-41 design a significant advantage over these new adversaries. The ships' armament was otherwise unchanged, apart from an increased number of 2cm anti-aircraft guns, of which there were now to be 34.|$|E

500|$|The {{genre of}} roguelike broadly {{encompasses}} the gameplay that was popularized by the text-based game Rogue (1980), which <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> many variations {{due to its}} success; As of 2015, several hundred games claiming to be roguelikes were available through the Steam game catalog, and the user-run wiki RogueBasin tracks hundreds of roguelikes and their development. Because of the expansion of numerous variations on the roguelike theme, the gameplay elements characterizing the roguelike genre were explicitly defined at the International Roguelike Development Conference 2008 held in Berlin, Germany; these factors encompass {{what is known as}} the [...] "Berlin Interpretation". Some of the factors used in this definition include: ...|$|E
500|$|The game concept {{itself is}} based on an earlier title that Blow had envisioned but never completed. In this {{unfinished}} title, there was a side gameplay aspect that has a [...] "magic moment", according to Blow, that would have made the title exciting. The Witnesss gameplay {{is based on}} distilling out this [...] "magic moment" [...] from the previous concept game, and wrapping it within its own game and story. Blow has compared this moment to a spoiler for a movie, and thus has avoided disclosure of the mechanic or other aspects of the game. The maze panel idea <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> from an earlier idea that Blow had around 2002 for a game involving wizards which the player would cast spells through mouse gestures, a popular element of video games at the time, with the ability to modify the effect of the spells by slight alterations of specific gestures; elements of The Witnesss story borrow from this game concept.|$|E
500|$|Some {{aspects of}} Limbo <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> from Jensen's own past, {{such as the}} forest areas that were similar to forests around the farm where he grew up, and the spider coming from Jensen's arachnophobia. Jensen drew {{inspiration}} from film genres, including works of film noir, to set the art style of the game; the team's graphic artist, Morten Bramsen, is credited with recreating that art style. Much of the game's flow was storyboarded very early in development, such as the boy's encounters with spiders and mind-controlling worms, {{as well as the}} overall transition from a forest to a city, then to an abstract environment. As development progressed, some of the original ideas became too difficult for the small team to complete. The storyline also changed; originally, the spider sequences were to be present {{near the end of the}} game, but were later moved to the first part. In retrospect, Jensen was aware that the first half of the game contained more scripted events and encounters, while the second half of the game was lonelier and puzzle-heavy; Jensen attributed this to his lack of oversight during the latter stages of development. Jensen purposely left the game with an open ending though with a specific interpretation only he knew, though noted after the game's release that some players, posting in forum boards, had suggested resolutions that were [...] "scary close" [...] to his ideas.|$|E
