5|$|The same <b>basic</b> <b>procedure</b> {{was used}} {{by all of the}} {{above-mentioned}} psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E

500|$|For infant circumcision, {{devices such}} as the Gomco clamp, Plastibell and Mogen clamp are {{commonly}} used in the USA. [...] These follow the same <b>basic</b> <b>procedure.</b> First, the amount of foreskin to be removed is estimated. The practitioner opens the foreskin via the preputial orifice to reveal the glans underneath and ensures it is normal before bluntly separating the inner lining of the foreskin (preputial epithelium) from its attachment to the glans. The practitioner then places the circumcision device (this sometimes requires a dorsal slit), which remains until blood flow has stopped. Finally, the foreskin is amputated. For older babies and adults, circumcision is often performed surgically without specialized instruments, and alternatives such Unicirc, Prepex or the Shang ring are available. Circumcision using the Shang ring appears to be safer and more effective than does conventional circumcision.|$|E

40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{controlling}} disruptive lunchroom behaviors {{of elementary school}} children were compared: <b>basic</b> modification <b>procedures,</b> <b>basic</b> modification <b>procedures</b> plus punishment essays, and <b>basic</b> modification <b>procedures</b> plus mediation essays. During an in-service workshop, six paraprofessional lunch aides received training in these methods to modify three classes of disruptive lunchroom behaviors. They then applied the methods in a counter-balanced design. Fourth- and fifth-grade elementary school pupils were observers and made reliability counts of the target misbehaviors under the various methods. Results indicated that during the periods when aides had been directed to use <b>basic</b> modification <b>procedures</b> plus mediation essays, target misbehaviors were almost totally eliminated and occurred significantly less often than during the periods when they had been directed to use <b>basic</b> modification <b>procedures</b> alone or <b>basic</b> modification <b>procedures</b> plus punishment essays...|$|R

The <b>basic</b> <b>procedure</b> in chromatography is to flow the solution containing the protein through a column packed with various materials.

Usually proteins are detected as they are coming off the column by their absorbance at 280nm. Many different chromatographic methods exist: ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{approval}} for Operation Opera, the Israelis began to plan their mission against Osirak. The <b>basic</b> <b>procedure</b> for the airstrike had been formulated {{as early as}} 1979. [...] However, the Israelis needed photographic intelligence about {{the layout of the}} plant. That task allegedly fell to the Iranians. Rather than carrying out a follow up air raid after their September attack, on November 30, 1980, an Iranian F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet took pictures of the Osirak reactor. The photographs were allegedly placed in a top-secret metal container, and certain elements of the Iranian military delivered them to the Israelis. With these photographs, the Israelis began to plan out Operation Opera.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>procedure</b> {{requires}} {{the synthesis of}} a short DNA primer. [...] This synthetic primer contains the desired mutation and is complementary to the template DNA around the mutation site so it can hybridize with the DNA in the gene of interest. [...] The mutation may be a single base change (a point mutation), multiple base changes, deletion, or insertion. [...] The single-strand primer is then extended using a DNA polymerase, which copies {{the rest of the}} gene. The gene thus copied contains the mutated site, and is then introduced into a host cell as a vector and cloned. Finally, mutants are selected by DNA sequencing to check that they contain the desired mutation.|$|E

40|$|Small animal Magnetic Resonance (MR) {{research}} {{has emerged as}} {{an important element of}} modern biomedical research due to its non-invasive nature and the richness of biological information it provides. MR does not require any ionizing radiation and can noninvasively provide higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to other tomographic or spectroscopic modalities. In this protocol, we will focus on small animal MR imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) to noninvasively acquire relaxation weighted 1 H images of mouse and to obtain 31 P spectra of mouse muscle. This work does not attempt to cover every aspect of small animal MRI/MRS but rather introduces <b>basic</b> <b>procedures</b> of mouse MRI/MRS experiments. The main goal of this work is to inform researchers of the <b>basic</b> <b>procedures</b> for in vivo MR experiments on small animals.
