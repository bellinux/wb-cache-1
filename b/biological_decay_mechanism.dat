40|$|Operator-splitting {{technique}} (OST) is {{a common}} mathematical approach used in {{the solution of the}} advection-dispersion-reaction equation (ADRE), especially in the presence of <b>biological</b> <b>decay,</b> where the scales of transport and <b>biological</b> <b>decay</b> are far apart. The OST introduces a time-lag between the advection-dispersion and reaction stages by splitting the ADRE causing a breakdown of the physics of the problem, thus limiting its applicability. In this work, the applicability of the operator splitting technique is studied in parts. This first manuscript addresses the critical limitations of the operator-splitting technique as related to first-order decay, and the second manuscript extends the work to include coupled transport between hydrocarbon and oxygen with Monod kinetics describing <b>biological</b> <b>decay.</b> The critical assessment is performed to address the errors associated with the time-lag due to splitting. The assessment is based on mass balance errors, deviations of concentration prediction and sensitivities of concentration deviations. The results show that the splitting introduces an inherent error independent of the discretization errors. This inherent error increases with reaction rate and time-lag, and the overall errors can be reduced by using the alternate operator-splitting technique suggested by previous researchers...|$|R

This contri-bution {{discusses}} briefly what <b>decay</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may enter in such decays and presents, {{on behalf of the}} IS 541 collaboration at ISOLDE/CERN, preliminary data from a search for the beta-delayed proton decay of the halo nucleus 11 Be. 1 Beta-particle <b>decay</b> <b>mechanism</b> The Q-values for beta-decays increase as one moves towards the driplines and eventually become larger than the particle separation energies in the daughter nuclei. This allows population of final states containing, apart from the beta particle and the associated (anti) neutrino, one or more parti-cles (protons, neutrons or heavier particles) in continuum states and a recoiling final nucleus. Such processes allow many different physics questions to be probed experimentally — see [1, 2] for re-cent reviews — and are normally referred to as beta-delayed particle emission. However, this name suggests a two-step process: the beta decay feeding resonance states in the daughter nucleus that sub-sequently decay by particle emission. The other possible <b>decay</b> <b>mechanism,</b> beta <b>decays</b> feeding the continuum states directly, deserves consideration as well.

Measurements and cultures from aerosol ages of 10, 20, 40, 900 and 2700 seconds {{were used to determine}} the optimum droplet nucleus size for pathogen transport and the airborne bacterial <b>biological</b> <b>decay.</b> The droplet nuclei containing the greatest number of colony forming bacteria per unit volume of airborne sputum were between 1. 5 and 2. 6 mu m. Larger nuclei of 3. 9 mu m, were more likely to produce a colony when impacted onto growth media, because the greater volume of sputum comprising the larger droplet nuclei, compensated for lower concentrations of bacteria within the sputum of larger nuclei. Although more likely to produce a colony, the larger droplet nuclei were small in number, and the greatest numbers of colonies were instead produced by nuclei from 1. 5 to 5. 7 mu m. Very few colonies were produced by smaller droplet nuclei, despite their very large numbers. The concentration of viable bacteria within the dried sputum comprising the droplet nuclei exhibited an orderly dual decay over time with two distinct half-lives. Nuclei exhibiting a rapid <b>biological</b> <b>decay</b> process with a 10 second half-life were quickly exhausted, leaving only a subset characterized by a half-life of greater than 10 minutes.

Purpose: To use the experimentally measured three-body correlations to gain insight into the properties of O 26, including the <b>decay</b> <b>mechanism</b> and ground-state resonance energy. Method: O 26 was produced in a one-proton knockout reaction from F 27 and the O 24 +n+n decay products were measured using the MoNA-Sweeper setup. The three-body correlations from the O 26 ground-state resonance decay were extracted. The experimental results were compared to Monte Carlo simulations in which the resonance energy and <b>decay</b> <b>mechanism</b> were varied. Results: The measured three-body correlations were well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulations but were not sensitive to the <b>decay</b> <b>mechanism</b> due to the experimental resolutions.
