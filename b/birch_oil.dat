5000|$|Russia leather is a {{water-resistant}} leather, oiled with <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> after tanning. This leather {{was a major}} {{export good}} from 17th and 18th century Russia, as the availability of <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> limited its geographical production. The oil impregnation also deterred insect attack and gave a distinctive and pleasant aroma that {{was seen as a}} mark of quality in leather.|$|E

40|$|<b>Birch</b> tar <b>oil</b> (BTO) is a {{by-product}} of processing birch wood in a pyrolysis system. Accumulating evidence suggests the suitability of BTO as a biocide or repellent in terrestrial environments for the control of weeds, insects, molluscs and rodents. Once applied as biocide, BTO may end up, either through run-off or leaching, in aquatic systems and may have adverse effects on non-target organisms. As very {{little is known about}} the toxicity of BTO to aquatic organisms, the present study investigated acute toxicity (LC 50 /EC 50) of BTO for eight aquatic organisms. Bioassays with the Asellus aquaticus (crustacean), Lumbriculus variegatus (oligochaeta worm), Daphnia magna (crustacean), Lymnea sp. (mollusc), Lemna minor (vascular plant), Danio rerio (fish), Scenedesmus gracilis (algae), and Vibrio fischeri (bacterium) were performed according to ISO, OECD or USEPA-guidelines. The results indicated that BTO was practically nontoxic to most aquatic organisms as the median effective BTO concentrations against most organisms were > 150 mg L- 1. In conclusion, our toxicity tests showed that aquatic organisms are to some extent, invariably sensitive to <b>birch</b> tar <b>oil,</b> but suggest that BTO does not pose a severe hazard to aquatic biota. We deduce that, unless BTOs are not applied in the immediate vicinity of water bodies, no special precaution is require...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{investigated}} the antibacterial activity of fragrance ingredients against Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of severe pneumonia. Among the 41 different fragrance ingredients tested, {{we found that the}} natural fragrance ingredients oakmoss (OM) and <b>birch</b> tar <b>oil</b> (BT), which contain many components, exhibit potent antibacterial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, % (v/v)) of OM and BT were 0. 0020 and 0. 0024, respectively and were lower than that of cinnamic aldehyde (0. 0078), which has been previously shown to possess high antimicrobial activity. In a time?kill assay of OM and BT at MIC and two times MIC, the colony forming units (CFU) of the microbe were reduced to between 10 ? 3 to 10 ? 4 of the original CFU after 1 h co-incubation. After this time, the CFU gradually decreased in number, but remained above detection levels even after a 48 -h co-incubation, except for BT at two times MIC. In contrast, at a concentration of 0. 1 % OM and BT (approximately 50 times MIC), CFU were not detected after co-incubation for 1 h. Another 18 fragrance ingredients including ketone, aldehyde, lactone, acid, phenol derivative, aliphatic alcohol and quinoline also exhibited a lesser degree of antibacterial activity against L. pneumophila at a MIC of less than 0. 10...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>birch</b> tar <b>oil</b> (BTO) {{is a new}} {{innovation}} in plant and animal protection working against various weeds, harmful insects and rodents. Due to its novelty as a biocide/repellent/plant protection product, no comprehensive information {{on the effects of}} BTO on non-target soil organisms is available. In this study we examined the impact of BTO on non-target soil organisms (enchytraeids, nematodes and soil microbes) and plants using laboratory toxicity tests and field experiments. In addition, we determined the LC 50 value of BTO to the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa and the EC 50 value of BTO to the offspring production of the collembolan Folsomia candida. The effects of BTO on soil fauna were mostly insignificant. BTO seemed to be detrimental to the growth of plants directly after application, but this effect was short-term; after a period of 2. 5 months, the growth of most of the plant species recovered completely from the application. The LC 50 for A. caliginosa was 6560 mg BTO kg- 1 dry soil and EC 50 for juvenile production of F. candida was 5100 mg BTO kg- 1 dry soil. The results indicate that the risk caused by BTOs (concentration 500 - 1360 L ha- 1) to the soil environment is insignificant and short-term as compared to the many chemical products applied for similar purposes. ...|$|R
30|$|An {{accelerated}} laboratory mold test in a ARCTEST ARC 1500 climate chamber (Arctest Oy, Espoo, Finland) {{was performed}} {{using the same}} methodology described in Ahmed et al. [12]. TM and non-TM samples from each species (aspen and <b>birch)</b> for each <b>oil</b> treatments (Beckers, pine tar and tung oil) with three replications to produce 36 samples and with four replications, unimpregnated TM and non-TM wood from each species (aspen and birch) to produce 16 samples, {{were used for the}} accelerated mold test. The samples (25  ×  90  ×  200  mm) were suspended in {{the upper part of the}} chamber from supporting bars with the long dimension set horizontal and the flat surface set vertical and parallel to the other sample surfaces with approximately 15  mm gap between the randomly ordered samples. The temperature and RH in the chamber were set to be 27  °C and 92 %, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Populations of two molluscs, {{the land}} snail Arianta arbustorum and the Iberian slug Arion lusitanicus, have {{increased}} substantially {{in many places}} in the northern Fennoscandia in recent years. This has resulted in considerable aesthetic and economic damage to plants in home gardens and commercial nurseries. <b>Birch</b> tar <b>oil</b> (BTO), is a new biological plant protection product, and was tested against these molluscs. In this study we examined whether 2 types of BTO, used either alone, mixed together, or mixed with Vaseline®, could be applied as 1) a biological plant protection product for the control of land snails by direct topical spray application, 2) as a repellent against snails when painted on a Perspex® fence, and 3) as a repellent against slugs when smeared on pots containing Brassica pekinensis seedlings. Both the fences and the pots with seedlings were placed in each field with a high population of the target organism. When applied as a spray on snails, BTO did not act as a toxic pesticide but rendered the snails inactive {{for a period of}} several months. The BTO barriers were effective in repelling both snails and slugs. However, the repellent effect of BTO alone against the molluscs was short-term. Repeated treatments were required to keep the slugs away from the plants and we found that the interval between treatments should not exceed two weeks. A collar fastened around the rim of the pots, combined with the BTO treatment, did not give any additional benefit in hindering slugs from invading the plants. Most noticeably, the BTO+Vaseline® mixture prevented the land snails from passing over the treated fences for up to several months. The results of these experiments provide evidence that BTO, especially when mixed with Vaseline®, serves as an excellent long-term repellent against molluscs. ...|$|R
50|$|Russia leather is a {{particular}} form of bark-tanned cow leather. It is distinguished by a later processing step, after tanning, where <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> is worked into the rear face of the leather. This gives a leather that is particularly hard-wearing, flexible and resistant to water. The oil impregnation also deterred insect attack.|$|E
50|$|It was considered, {{even into}} the nineteenth century, that {{although}} the manufacture of 'Russia leather' could be successfully undertaken {{in the rest of}} Europe, production of the necessary <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> would still require import from Russia or Poland. It was likely that other tree species could be found that would produce an oil with similar preservative properties, but the distinctive aroma of genuine Russia leather would require the traditional birch.|$|E
50|$|The oiling {{process is}} what really distinguishes Russia leather from others. <b>Birch</b> <b>oil</b> {{is applied to the}} flesh side of the leather, soaking through {{completely}} and saturating the leather entirely. Care is taken that it is only applied {{to one side of the}} leather, keeping it away from the grain side to avoid discolouration and poor dyeing later. Seal oil is also reported to have been used, in addition.|$|E
50|$|The oak {{used for}} making bath brooms is cut down between June and August in a humid, dark forest. The {{branches}} are dried and tied {{in the same}} way as the birch bath broom. A correctly dried bath broom should have perfectly green leaves and smell of balsamic <b>birch</b> <b>oil.</b> The smell should increase greatly after steaming the broom. Large shoots are very flexible and thus pleasant to use on the body in the sauna.|$|E

A granite, very much like Vermont granite, is found near New Jerusalem. There is a marble saw mill on the Sacony near Grim's mill, where large blocks of marble are sawed into desirable sizes. It has been in operation since 1864. None of the early mines are now in operation.|$|E
50|$|Classic American {{sarsaparilla}} was {{not made}} from the extract of the sarsaparilla plant, a tropical vine distantly related to the lily. It was originally made from a blend of <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> and sassafras, the dried root bark of the sassafras tree. Sassafras was widely used as a home remedy in the 19th century - taken in sufficient doses, it induces sweating, which some people thought had health benefits. Sarsaparilla apparently made its debut as a patent medicine, an easy-to-take form of sassafras, much as Coca-Cola was first marketed in 1885 as a remedy for hangovers, headaches and morphine addiction. Besides {{the effects of the}} ingredients, sodas were popular in the United States at the time, due to the belief that carbonated water had health benefits.|$|E
50|$|The brand {{goes all}} the way back to 1768 when a Russian nobleman called Count Orlof {{commissioned}} a brand of perfume from Bayleys of Bond Street in London. The perfume was called 'Eau de Cologne Imperiale Russe'. Russia leather was a high-quality leather exported widely from Russia and recognisable by a distinctive aroma from its <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> tanning process. In 1921 Bayleys was acquired by Cussons Sons & Co, chaired by Alexander Tom Cussons. It was not until some years later in 1938 that Alex Cussons used the original perfume and created Cussons Imperial Leather soap and other toiletries. The soap was initially called 'Imperiale Russian Leather', but was soon renamed to Imperial Leather. In 1975 the Cussons Group was itself acquired by Paterson Zochonis, recently renamed to PZ Cussons.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{types of}} birch beer made from birch sap are {{available}} as well, distinguished by color. The color {{depends on the}} species of birch tree from which the sap is extracted (though enhancements via artificial coloring are common presently). Popular colors include brown, red, blue and clear (often called white birch beer), though others are possible. This drink is most commonly found in the Northeastern United States, and Newfoundland in Canada. After the sap is collected, it is distilled to make <b>birch</b> <b>oil.</b> The oil {{is added to the}} carbonated drink to give it the distinctive flavor, reminiscent of teaberry. Black birch is the most common source of extract. In the dairy country of southeastern and central Pennsylvania, an ice cream soda made with vanilla ice cream and birch beer is called a Birch Beer Float, while chocolate ice cream and birch beer makes a Black Cow.|$|E
50|$|Leather {{was applied}} to simple backstools, a chair with {{vertical}} rear posts and simple crosswise rails. These would be a commonplace chair today, {{but at the time}} it was more usual for chairs to have a solid wooden back. The leather was stretched across between the rails and nailed into place with large headed brass nails. Such undecorated chairs are a characteristic furniture style of the Interregnum period. Only Russia leather was flexible enough to be used in this way. Inferior leathers, when used, would crack across the edges of the frame. A better technique with such leathers was to support the leather from beneath with interwoven strips of canvas webbing. The odour of <b>birch</b> <b>oil</b> was recognised in the completed chairs and considered as a mark of quality. Russia leather chairs have been remarkably hard-wearing and examples have lasted in use into the 19th century, without recovering. When finally worn out, this was often by the surface of the leather having worn right through into a hole, still without any structural cracking of the leather, as a less flexible hide would fail.|$|E
