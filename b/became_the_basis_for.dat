5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E

5|$|Most other revolutionaries were {{detained}} {{in areas of}} present-day Bulgaria until spring 1849, and, passing through Rustchuk and Varna, {{were taken to the}} Anatolian city of Brusa, where they lived {{at the expense of the}} Ottoman state. They were allowed to return after 1856. During their period of exile, rivalry between the various factions became obvious, a conflict which <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> political allegiances in later years.|$|E
5|$|The aediles were {{in charge}} of various {{municipal}} tasks, e.g. the upkeep of temples, streets, and the water-supply. They were also responsible for public games, and some aspects of police work in the city. The quaestors were elected administrators, which could be put in charge of the treasury, the granaries, or various administrative postings in Italy, with the consuls, or in the provinces. In the late Republic, election to the quaestorship <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a life appointment to the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} what {{happened}} at Salon Kitty first came to light in Walter Schellenberg's memoirs, published in Germany in 1956 under the title The Labyrinth. Peter Norden later expanded the story in his 1970 book Salon Kitty. This book <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the highly controversial 1976 film Salon Kitty, directed by Tinto Brass and starring Helmut Berger as Walter Schellenberg (renamed Helmut Wallenberg) and Ingrid Thulin as Kitty Schmidt (renamed Kitty Kellermann).|$|E

5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently ignored by the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the formation around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete codification and execution, or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that assumed a German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E

5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Chadwick {{resigned}} the deanship, {{returning to}} Cambridge {{to take up}} the Regius Chair of Divinity. Additionally, he became a Syndic of Cambridge University Press, a Fellow of Magdalene, and was installed as an honorary canon of Ely Cathedral. He gained a reputation as a popular lecturer in Cambridge, and between 1982 and 1983 gave the Sarum Lectures in Oxford, for which his subject was Augustine of Hippo. Edited, these lectures <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> his 1986 book, Augustine. He retired from the professorship in 1983 and settled in Oxford.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 David {{teamed up}} with comedian Jerry Seinfeld to create a pilot for NBC called The Seinfeld Chronicles, which <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Seinfeld, {{one of the most}} {{successful}} shows in history, reaching the top of TV Guide list of the 50 greatest TV shows of all time. Entertainment Weekly ranked it the third-best TV show of all time. David made occasional uncredited appearances on the show, playing such roles as Frank Costanza's cape-wearing lawyer and the voice of George Steinbrenner. He was also the primary inspiration for the show's character George Costanza. David left Seinfeld on friendly terms after the seventh season but returned to write the series finale in 1998, two years later. He also continued to provide the voice for the Steinbrenner character.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Lake Placid and Keene were {{connected}} by the North West Bay Road, an east–west highway linking Hopkinton to Westport. The highway was initially a crude, impassable road; however, it was significantly improved {{by the state}} of New York in the mid-1810s. A highway linking Keene to Underwood was constructed by 1846; at Underwood, the road connected to a stagecoach road that went from Albany to the Canada–US border. The latter road <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> most of modern US9.|$|E
5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Presumably, he died either {{during the}} reign of William I or during the {{following}} reign of William II.
