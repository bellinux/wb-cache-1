5|$|On the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, drive fishing of <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphins was {{practice}}d until 1990, {{when the}} practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly Indian Ocean <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphins but also common <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphins were captured in these hunts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> {{dolphins}} {{can live}} {{for more than}} 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all <b>Bottlenose</b> dolphins will live longer than 60 years. <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> {{dolphins}} {{conflict with}} small-scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas. Common <b>bottlenose</b> dolphins are probably attracted to fishing nets because {{they offer a}} concentrated food source.|$|E
40|$|In Japan, {{the chinese}} finless {{porpoises}} {{which had been}} caught in the Japanese coastal sea are bred in three aquariums, but the underwater sound of this species have not been recognized yet. The authors collected their signals and analyzed them by sound spectorograph {{in the same way as}} for the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin. 1) Unlike the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin, however, this species did not make "Whistle", and "Clicks" of this species were lower than those of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin...|$|R

5|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female <b>bottlenose.</b> Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Recent {{molecular}} studies show the genus contains two species, the common <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). <b>Bottlenose</b> dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. They live in all oceans except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions.|$|E
40|$|The {{underwater}} {{sound of the}} false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) was-recorded at the sea area between Iki island and Tsushima island north-west of Kytighu {{as well as at}} the Shimonoseki Aquarium where the false killer whale had beeri kept since 1960. The recorded sound was analysed by the sound spectrograph. The false killer whale is taxonomically close to the killer whale (Orcinusow), but the feeding migration of the false killer whale in winter is mixed with the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin (Tursiops gilli) and also the {{underwater sound}} of the false killer whale bears a remarkable resemblance to that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin. The underwater sound of the false killer whale is divided into three types of signals, that is, whistle, clicks, and stratiform sound, and the function of these signals is the very same as that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin. The whistle is in the range from 5 to 10 kc being identical to that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin. However, unlike in the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin, it is rather toneless and its sound spectorographic pattern is parallel to the abscissa. Next, the frequency of the clicks is not so high being within the limit below 13 kc, but the repetition rate of the clicks is full of variety ranging from 2 -per-second to 100 -per-second. Finally, the stratiform sound which is observed at the time of feeding and in the course of courtship is the same as that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin. Generally speaking, these three types of signals are almost the same as those of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin, but vary much more than the latter. !?﻿ 1. The underwater sound of the false killer whales had been recorded since 1960 mainly at the Shimonoseki Aquarium and partly at the sea area of Iki-Tsushima. 2. The underwater sound of the false killer whales is roughly classified into three types of signals, i. e., whistle, clicks and stratiform sound. 3. Whistle of the talse killer whale is much the same as that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin, but with less intonation. 4. The false killer whale emits whistle together with clicks at a time. 5. Whistle of the false killer whale is in the frequency range of 4 - 9 kc. 6. There are many kinds of clicks of the false killer whale, however, generally the repetition rate is low as compared with that of the <b>bottlenosed</b> dolphin. And the frequency range of these clicks is below 15 kc. 7. Stratiform sound of the false killer whale is in greatest abundance and richest variety. Mating call, food intake call, calls similar to bird songs, and grating sound all belong to the stratiform sound. 8. The clicks of the false killer whale show the sonagraphic pattern of the stratiform sound when repetition rate is momentarily increased to be more than 100 pulses per second...|$|R

5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin, {{especially}} calves. The <b>bottlenose</b> dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on <b>bottlenose</b> dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. <b>Bottlenose</b> dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|Some recent genetic {{evidence}} suggests the Indo-Pacific <b>bottlenose</b> {{belongs in the}} genus Stenella, since it is more like the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) than the common <b>bottlenose.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in criticism and the considerable toxicity {{of the meat}} appears to be achieving the opposite. During the first hunt {{of the season in}} Taiji in 2009, an estimated 50 Pilot Whales and 100 <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphins were captured. Although all the Pilot Whales were killed, and 30 <b>Bottlenose</b> Dolphins were taken for use in dolphinariums, the 70 remaining animals were set free again instead of being killed for consumption.|$|E
