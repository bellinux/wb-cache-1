5|$|Phillips first sold {{bicycles}} and motorbikes, but later started selling and recharging <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> a {{shop in the}} front room of his house in 1925. After a decline in demand for <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> the early 1950s, he started selling electrical goods and popular records. In 1955, Phillips set up a recording studio called Phillips' Sound Recording Services.|$|E

5|$|The {{transfer}} of 750 noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It {{had been stripped}} of practically every NCO except the first sergeants of companies and <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> the division. Even though it had received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 {{of them from the}} Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it had only two battalions in its three regiments, two firing <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942 heavy Guards mortar battalions {{were formed}} around the new M-30 static rocket launch frames, {{consisting}} of 96 launchers in three <b>batteries.</b> <b>In</b> July, {{a battalion of}} BM-13s {{was added to the}} establishment of a tank corps. In 1944, the BM-31 was used in motorized heavy Guards mortar battalions of 48 launchers. In 1943, Guards mortar brigades, and later divisions, were formed equipped with static launchers.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{volunteers and}} draftees {{provided}} the Union army with 129 infantry regiments, 13 cavalry regiments, 3 cavalry companies, 1 regiment of heavy artillery, and 26 light artillery <b>batteries.</b> <b>In</b> {{addition to providing}} Union troops, Indiana also organized its own volunteer militia, known as the Indiana Legion. Formed in May 1861, the Legion was responsible for protecting Indiana's citizens from attack and maintaining order within the state.|$|E
5|$|The IAF {{began working}} on a SAM {{suppression}} operation {{since the end of}} the Yom Kippur War. Rising tensions between Israel and Syria over Lebanon escalated in the early 1980s and culminated in Syria deploying the SAM <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> the Beqaa Valley. On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, and on the third day of the war, with clashes going on between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Syrian Army, Israel decided to launch the operation.|$|E
5|$|The XXII Corps was {{supported}} by the majority of the Yildirim Army's heavy artillery for counter battery operations. Here, three of the five Ottoman Army heavy artillery <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> Palestine (the 72nd, 73rd and 75th Batteries) were deployed. Further, the Ottoman front line regiments had been alerted that a major attack was imminent.|$|E

5|$|The nickel {{hydrogen}} battery {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2). For example, the ISS, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor are equipped with nickel-hydrogen <b>batteries.</b> <b>In</b> the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life.|$|E
5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for issue to the <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of the war the river {{monitors}} bombarded Paraguayan positions and artillery <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> support of the army, notably at Angostura, Timbó and along the Tebicuary and Manduvirá Rivers. After the war the ships were divided between the newly formed Upper Uruguay and Mato Grosso Flotillas. Alagoas was transferred to Rio de Janeiro in the 1890s and participated in the Fleet Revolt of 1893–94. The ships were disposed of during the last two decades of the 19th century, although Rio Grande was docked for reconstruction in 1899. However, the work was never completed and she was eventually scrapped in 1907.|$|E

5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigade—a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun <b>batteries.</b> <b>In</b> the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads and from the flanks of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.|$|E
5|$|In several countries, {{fire safety}} {{officials}} encourage citizens {{to use the}} two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires. Similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans, inspecting vehicle lights, checking storage areas for hazardous materials, reprogramming thermostats, and seasonal vaccinations. Locations without DST can instead use {{the first days of}} spring and autumn as reminders.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; {{three were}} damaged {{in the attack}} but all {{returned}} to base. On 26January, RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several Silkworm missile <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a Polnochny-class landing ship with rockets and cannon. The Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched on the Kuwait-Saudi border, were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them, allied Jaguars forming {{a portion of the}} delivering aircraft. The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm.|$|E

The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.|$|E
5|$|The French {{opened fire}} on the forts of Salé at 10:00a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated {{instantly}} with forty batteries of artillery weapons. An hour into the confrontation, the <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> Salé were destroyed, and the artillery in Rabat were damaged to a level that they became almost useless. The French fire intensified, but at 3:30p.m., the damaged batteries {{were removed from the}} city by Moroccan forces; however, resistance did not stop until 5:00p.m. Sané and Gomer, lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle, while Henri IV continued its barrage on the city until 7:00a.m. the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion <b>batteries</b> <b>in</b> plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard.

Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
