5|$|As an {{opponent}} of the Vietnam War, Bedell signed a petition urging against United States military intervention in Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war would <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{advances}} in astronomy came {{about with the}} introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth's own Sun, but {{with a wide range of}} temperatures, masses, and sizes.|$|E

5|$|As colonies {{closer to}} each other are more genetically similar, {{independent}} colony foundation is most likely associated with nuptial flight if they disperse far from genetically similar colonies they originate from. Inseminated queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out, known as the nest-site limitation hypothesis. Some queens could even try {{to return to their}} nests that they came from after nuptial flight, but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> queens birth nest.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Clans, yet follows {{a different set of}} ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E
5|$|He {{spoke to}} Harold Howitt {{when he was}} {{thinking}} of leaving the BTC and was informed that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) would <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> production of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, 1996, BBC Radio 1 {{broadcast}} the one-hour play Independence Day UK, written, produced, {{and directed by}} Dirk Maggs, a spin-off depicting the alien invasion from a British perspective. None of the original cast was present. Dean Devlin gave Maggs permission to produce an original version, {{on the condition that}} he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that the British were not depicted as saving the day. Independence Day UK was set up to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds - the first 20 minutes were live.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued heavy {{rainfall}} and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario. A gale warning was also issued for Lake Ontario, eastern Lake Erie, the Saint Lawrence River and Georgian Bay. A news report on September 14 warned conditions could <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disaster caused by Hurricane Hazel 49years prior, resulting in widespread media {{coverage on the}} hurricane. Researchers on a Convair 580 flight studied the structure of Isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm, after two similar studies for Hurricane Michael in 2000 and Tropical Storm Karen in 2001. While flying in a thunderstorm, ice build forced the plane to descend.|$|E

5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system would <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would {{have the option of}} using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might <b>be,</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of an internal global salty ocean with an aquatic environment supported by global ocean circulation patterns, with an energy source and simple organic compounds in contact with Enceladus's rocky core, may advance the study of astrobiology {{and the study of}} potentially habitable environments for microbial extraterrestrial life. The {{presence of}} a wide range of organic compounds and ammonia indicates their source may <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water/rock reactions known to occur on Earth and that are known to support life. Therefore, several robotic missions have been proposed to further explore Enceladus and assess its habitability; some of the proposed missions are: Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), Enceladus Explorer (En-Ex), Enceladus Life Finder (ELF), Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE), and Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability (ELSAH).|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series trains.|$|E
5|$|A {{one-shot}} {{comic book}} {{adaptation of the}} show was announced in October 2014. Produced by KaBoom!, an imprint of Boom! Studios, the comic was released on November 5, 2014. The comic was supervised by McHale and was produced as an oversized special. The comic was illustrated by Jim Campbell, a writer/storyboard artist on the television series. A special variant cover, by McHale, was also released. The success of the standalone comic led to further issues being commissioned in May 2015 and began {{to be released in}} August 2015. According to Patrick McHale, the comic books would <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one-shot comic, detailing the events that occurred in between certain episodes and will expand on the miniseries. The success of the series of one-shots led to an ongoing series of comics, serving as both a sequel and prequel to the series, rather than telling adventures that happened between episodes. The stories are told parallel, with half the comic detailing Greg returning to mysterious dreamlands in his sleep. The other half chronicles the Woodsman's daughter, Anna, and how she became lost in the Unknown.|$|E
