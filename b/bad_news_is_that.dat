Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life".

Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters.

2500|$|... {{but here}} we run into trouble, since some entries of the first {{sequence}} may be bigger than the corresponding entries of the second sequence, and some others may be smaller. [...] It follows that the relation defined {{in this way is}} only a partial order. [...] To get around this, we have to specify which positions matter. Since there are infinitely many indices, we don't want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free ultrafilter U on the natural numbers; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good news is that Zorn's lemma guarantees the existence of many such U; the <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they cannot be explicitly constructed.) We think of U as singling out those sets of indices that [...] "matter": We write (a0, a1, a2, ...) ≤ (b0, b1, b2, ...) if and only if the set of natural numbers { n : a'n ≤ b'n } is in U.|$|E
2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency. Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen's proposal: an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas special. The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special for advertising during the holiday season. [...] "The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> today is Wednesday and they'll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday," [...] Allen remarked to Mendelson. He quickly contacted Schulz, and the duo got to work with plans for a Peanuts Christmas special. The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose [...] "ideas flowed nonstop." [...] According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of [...] "winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music." [...] The outline did not change over the course of its production.|$|E

The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the book leaves out much that it ought to include and includes some that it ought to leave out." [...] As {{an example of what}} he felt should have been included, Cooper notes [...] "In spite of the book’s strength in depicting Wilson’s family life, it is also oddly unsatisfactory about one of its most important figures: his father." [...] As another example, Cooper states that [...] "Equally glaring is the lack of attention to Wilson’s thought." [...] Cooper questions Berg's inclusion of the memories of Wilson wife by saying [...] "Kristie Miller’s excellent biography of Wilson’s two wives could have raised red flags about Edith’s memory." [...] Cooper not only disputes Berg's framing of Wilson's racism but also his religious perspective, calling into question the use of Bible quotations {{at the beginning of each}} chapter: [...] "Other reviewers have found this practice tiresome; I found it unenlightening and strange." [...] Cooper ends by saying [...] "To sum up, this biography has much to recommend it, especially the pleasure it affords in reading it. Its shortcomings make it far from balanced or comprehensive, much less “definitive." ...|$|E

As a comparison, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad only reported 33 percent of its passenger trains an average of only 8 minutes late.

As it had no real freight traffic or industries on the line, the passenger traffic was about all there was left, at this point, and with most trains being almost 20 minutes late every day, it would never build up a solid, profitable, passenger base.|$|R

Also, distortions arising from the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field are calculated. These effects resolve the controversy on unphysical numbers of 'wrong-charge' TPC tracks.
