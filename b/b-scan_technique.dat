40|$|Twenty {{patients}} undergoing routine {{left ventricular}} single-plane angiography {{have been investigated}} by an ultrasonic triggered <b>B-scan</b> <b>technique</b> to provide a two-dimensional cross-sectional image of the left ventricle in end-systole end-diastole. An area-length method {{has been used to}} establish the correlation between the angiographic and the echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular chamber volume (r equals 0. 88) and ejection fraction (r equals 0. 81). Differences between the two techniques are discussed, and it is concluded that in approximately 80 per cent of patients triggered B-scanning may provide a safe, non-invasive, and convenient technique for the determination of volumes and certain functional parameters, especially in patients with dilated hearts and irregular left ventricular shape, where M-scanning is known to be less reliable...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{pulse-echo}} rf waveform {{analysis and}} selected pattern rec-ognition methods {{were applied to}} classification of breast tissue. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} classification of solid tissue areas since fluid areas are easily identified by present <b>B-scan</b> <b>techniques.</b> Pattern recognition techniques such as the Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD), Probability Density Function (PDF) curves, jackknife estimate and committee vote were used to construct and evaluate a two class algorithm, malignant versus benign tissue areas. domain features from 100 pathologically confirmed tissue areas from 87 patients were used to train the algorithm. Algorithm performance was acquired via the generalized jackknife procedure to significantly reduce the bias frequently encountered in algorithm evaluation. Estimated values of algorithm performance are sensitivity and specificity values of 96 percent and 68 percent, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{reconstruction}} by {{the synthetic}} aperture focusing technique (SAFT) {{has a great}} potential to image concrete elements and detect embedded objects. Its algorithm focuses ultrasonic signals received at many aperture points by coherent superposition, yielding a high-resolution image of the region of interest. Using this approach, several problems caused by the strongly inhomogeneous structure of concrete are diminished, where scattering of transmitted pulses leads to disturbing phenomena such as attenuation and structural noise. This contribution is intended to review {{the work of the}} writers on the application of SAFT reconstruction to concrete testing. First, consequences of scattering of ultrasonic waves in concrete are qualitatively explained. Then the use of SAFT is discussed in comparison to traditional A-scan and <b>B-scan</b> <b>techniques.</b> Different reconstruction algorithms and implementations are presented for one-, two-, and three-dimensional SAFT. Pulse-echo measurement systems are described, which are able to acquire large sets of data on linear and planar apertures employing single transducer, transducer array, and scanning laser Doppler vibrometer arrangements. To illustrate the application of the SAFT techniques, examples from laboratory and field experiments are described comprising imaging of back walls, tendon ducts containing faults, layers, and reinforcement in concrete elements...|$|R

Mechanized ultrasonic inspections {{play a major role}} within the ISI framework. Requirements in terms of scope and experience with ISI have been reported earlier. The ultrasonic techniques that had been used for many years utilized multichannel UT equipment, recording maximum amplitudes and corresponding time-of-flight gates. The measured data were presented in computer processed C-Scans with additional time-of-flight evaluations of indications in <b>B-Scan</b> representations (TIM-LOK <b>techniques).</b> The defect classification capabilities of our UT ISI technique have been proven in PISC I, PISC II and other round robin tests...|$|R
40|$|Signal-degrading speckle is {{one factor}} that can reduce the quality of optical {{coherence}} tomography images. We demonstrate {{the use of a}} hierarchical model-based motion estimation processing scheme based on an affine-motion model to reduce speckle in optical coherence tomography imaging, by image registration and the averaging of multiple <b>B-scans.</b> The proposed <b>technique</b> is evaluated against other methods available in the literature. The results from a set of retinal images show the benefit of the proposed technique, which provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of the square root of the number of averaged images, leading to clearer visual information in the averaged image. The benefits of the proposed technique are also explored in the case of ocular anterior segment imaging...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Vaknine and Lorenz [l] discuss {{the merits of}} lateral {{deconvolution}} of demodulated <b>B-scans.</b> While this <b>technique</b> will decrease the lateral blurring of single discrete targets, such as the diaphragm in their figure 3, it is inappropriate to apply the method to the echoes arising from inhomogeneous structures such as soft tissue. In this latter case, the echoes from individual scatterers within the resolution cell of the transducer interfere to give random fluctuations in received echo amplitude termed speckle { 2]. Although his process can be modeled as a linear convolution {{similar to that of}} conventional image formation theory { 31, the process of demodulation is a nonlinear process which loses the all-important phase information, and prevents the subsequent restoration of the image by Wiener filtering, itself d linpar process. 0 198 s Academic press, This fact has been demonstrated by examining the effect of deconvolution and demodulation on tht detectability of regions of differing mean amplitude embedded in a random scattering matrix C 4. 51, the so-called low contras...|$|R
5000|$|As stated above, {{properties}} of ultrasound energy traveling through biological tissues {{has been extensively}} studied in recent years. The attenuation due to scattering of energy in different tissues can be measured by a device called a transducer. Recorded information from transducers such as the relationship {{to the site of}} origin and intensity of the signal can then be put together to form images of what lies inside the target tissues. Higher frequency ultrasound waves generally produce higher resolution images, but attenuation also increases as frequency increases which restricts imaging depth. Consequently, the best frequency has been determined for each type of diagnostic test and body tissue. Some of the more common ultrasound tests include A-scans, M-scans, <b>B-scans,</b> and Doppler <b>techniques.</b> These test produce images ranging from one-dimensional images to moving, real-time two -dimensional images that can often be seen immediately on a screen. The advent of ultrasound technology has completely changed the medical diagnostic field due to its non-invasive characteristic. Medical professionals can now observe tissues within the body without having to physically enter the body. This reduces the amount of invasive and risky diagnostic procedures and increases the chances of a correct diagnosis. Some common medical imaging procedures include: ...|$|R
