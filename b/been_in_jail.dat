5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E

Franklin has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> since his arrest awaiting trial; the large volume of evidence in this case, some dating back thirty years, had caused a lengthy pretrial discovery.|$|E

Each of the three charges carried a maximum of 10 years in prison. He is still awaiting sentencing to between 30 and 46 months in prison depending on whether U.S. Chief Judge Michael J.

25|$|Joseph Smith, {{the founder}} {{and leader of the}} Latter Day Saint movement, and his brother Hyrum Smith were killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois, on June 27, 1844. The {{brothers}} had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> awaiting trial when an armed mob of about 200 men stormed the facility, their faces painted black with wet gunpowder. Hyrum was killed first, having been shot in the face. After emptying the pistol with which he tried to defend himself, Joseph was then shot several times while trying to escape from a second-story window, and fell from the window as he died.|$|E
25|$|On 7 December, Anti-Treaty IRA gunmen shot two TDs, Sean Hales and Pádraic Ó Máille, in Dublin as {{they were}} on their way to the Dáil. Hales was killed and O'Máille was badly wounded. After an {{emergency}} cabinet meeting, the Free State government decided on the retaliatory executions of four prominent Republicans (one from each province). Accordingly, on 8 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four members of the IRA Army Executive, who had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> since the first week of the war - Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey - were executed in revenge. O'Connor and Mellows particularly were revered heroes of the War of Independence. This was arguably an unlawful act, as the four Republicans had been captured before the Dáil passed the legislation authorising executions. Later on the same day the Dáil debated the executions and retrospectively approved them by a vote of 39-14. One of the poignant aspects of the incident was that O'Connor and Kevin O'Higgins were formerly close friends, and O'Connor had been best man at O'Higgins' wedding just a few months previously. Historian Michael Hopkinson reports that Richard Mulcahy had pressed for the executions and that Kevin O'Higgins was the last member of cabinet to give his consent.|$|E

Labour came in third with 15 seats. In July 2013, as a [...] "good will gesture" [...] to restart peace talks with the Palestinian Authority, Israel agreed to release 104 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> since before the 1993 Oslo Accords, including militants who had killed Israeli civilians.

2500|$|Many of {{the prisoners}} had already <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for 13 months when, on 14 July 1880 Bryce {{introduced}} the Maori Prisoners' Bill designed to postpone their trial indefinitely. Bryce, who prided himself on plain talk, told Parliament it was [...] "a farce to talk of trying these prisoners for the offences {{for which they were}} charged ... if they had been convicted in all probability they would not have got more than 24 hours' imprisonment. In the Bill we drop that provision in regard to the trial altogether." [...] The new legislation declared that all those in jail were now deemed to have been lawfully arrested and to be in lawful custody and decreed that [...] "no Court, Judge, Justices of the Peace or other person shall during the continuance of this Act discharge, bail or liberate the said Natives".|$|E

2500|$|An initial {{toxicology}} {{report released}} by the Harris County medical examiner's office found [...] "a remarkably high concentration" [...] of THC for someone who had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for three days, leading to speculation that Bland may have had access to marijuana while in jail. [...] Waller County assistant district attorney, Warren Diepraam {{said that it was}} more likely that Bland had ingested a very large amount of marijuana prior to her arrest. [...] A toxicologist for the Tarrant County medical examiner's office agreed, indicating a THC level as high as Bland’s suggests she “either had access to the drug in jail or she was a consistent user of the drug and her body had accumulated THC {{to the point that it}} was slowly releasing it over time.” But he added: [...] "I have never seen a report in the literature or from any other source of residual THC that high three days after someone stops using the drug." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that in late November 2012, Kat's lover would [...] "turn stalker", with Inside Soap saying that [...] "there {{is no way that}} the mystery man is letting her get away so easily [...] That's proved when he ups his game to get Kat to meet with him at their lovenest". An insider told the magazine that Kat's man is [...] "persistent, ruthless and utterly fixated on her. This could be a very dangerous game for Kat to play. Might the man who loves her completely destroy her life?" [...] It was also reported in November that Derek would be killed off from the series at Christmas, and it was speculated that he would be murdered. Alfie and Kat were both named as suspects, amongst many others, with Soaplife saying that if Derek is Kat's lover, he might turn violent if she continues to reject him and she might be forced to kill him, or Alfie might find out that Derek is Kat's lover and murder him in revenge, referring back to Richie's reminders that Alfie had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> and would want to harm Kat's lover. In fact, Alfie quickly became the favourite with bookmakers William Hill.|$|E
2500|$|In early September, it was {{reported}} that Kat would confess the affair to Alfie, but would refuse to name the man involved. Shane Richie spoke to Inside Soap, saying that Alfie has no reason to believe Kat is cheating on him, assumes she is just partaking in harmless flirtation, and fully trusts her. He opined that Alfie believes Kat would not lie to him after having affairs in the past, but does not believe her excuses when she receives flowers from her lover. This leads to Kat confessing. Richie said that Alfie's [...] "heart [...] break in two". Richie went on to describe the Moons' marriage as [...] "a bit staid" [...] because Alfie is [...] "set in his ways" [...] while Kat is [...] "out looking for a bit of fun." [...] He explained that Alfie is very committed to Kat, and is [...] "in this marriage for the long run." [...] He said that viewers may not want to see Kat and Alfie totally happy, describing them as [...] "like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor [...] They can't be with each other and they can't be without each other." [...] He then promised that [...] "what happens to Alfie next is absolutely great!" [...] When asked what Alfie might do when he finds out who Kat is having the affair with, Richie said that he would get revenge, as [...] "everyone forgets Alfie's <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> Marriage has taken off his edge, but if he finds out his wife has been with one of his closest friends, well, any bloke would want to cut the other blokes knackers [...] off, wouldn't he?" [...] Richie added that the cast were [...] "thrilled" [...] with the storyline, saying that everyone involved is enjoying it. It was confirmed that viewers would not find out who Kat was having the affair with at this time, and that suspects would still be eliminated one at a time. Inside Soap then reported that a second suspect would be eliminated [...] "very soon". Michael was then eliminated in the episode broadcast on 14 September.|$|E
