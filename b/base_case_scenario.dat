The search for an optimal solution to a problem must take into consideration this variability, otherwise running the risk of critical dimensioning or cost estimation errors. Testing solutions using full data sets covering large periods of time can be a computational challenge, and the analysis of results complicated. For the feasibility of such a study, it is therefore necessary to reduce the large data sets to a number of <b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> which simultaneously reduce the number of data points to be handled while still representing the variability of the system. A novel method is therefore developed to address this problem.

The method exploits a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, minimising the standard deviation of the <b>base</b> <b>cases</b> compared to the real data as well as respecting crucial null value periods. Null value periods are typically found in turnarounds or supply and demand problems and are usually incorrectly represented in other methods. Lastly, the resulting <b>base</b> <b>cases</b> are sequential periods, which is important when dealing with scheduling, shutdown or storage problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Simulations {{with the}} power market model EMPS with weekly time {{resolution}} {{have been made to}} assess the effects of large scale wind production to the Nordic electricity market. Two <b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> are made (reference for the Nordic market area for years 2000 and 2010) and wind is added to these systems in 3 steps. The results for the simulations with 16 … 46 TWh/a wind production in Nordic countries (4 … 12 % of electricity consumption), show that wind power replaces mostly coal condense and oil as fuel for electric boilers. As a result of fuels replaced by wind production a CO 2 reduction is achieved, of 680 … 620 gCO 2 /kWh. Indications for bottlenecks in transmission can be seen, especially to Central Europe, when the wind production is above 20 TWh/a. Average spot market price drops by roughly 0. 2 eurocents per 10 TWh/a wind production added to the system. Avoided costs for wind power production are roughly 2 eurocents/kWh for today’s system and 3. 1 eurocents/kWh for 2010 system with CO 2 tax and reduced power surplus. Changes in socio-economic surplus for the market is 2. 4 … 2. 0 eurocents/kWh for 16 … 46 TWh/a wind production, i. e. 15 % higher than average spot price (for 2010, 3. 9 eurocents/kWh, 30 % higher than average spot price) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to perform}} comparative impact assessment for production of conventional aluminum alloy (AlMg 3) used in aircraft fuselage and lighter weight carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The epoxy resin (EP), a thermosetting polymer typically impregnated with carbon fiber (CF) tows {{is assumed to}} be replaced by polypropylene (PP) which is a thermoplastic polymer. The assessment framework is demonstrated by postulating a scenario where AlMg 3 in Boeing B 737 - 800 fuselage is substituted with CFRP to reduce the fuselageweight by about 4. 3 tons. OpenLCA 1. 4. 2 platform, including Ecoinvent v 2. 2 life cycle inventory (LCI) database and TRACE 2. 1 methodology for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), is used to quantify and compare mid-point impact categories of the AlMg 3 -based scenario and the postulated <b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> using CFRP (53. 8 wt% CF). The CF content in CFRP is used as a sensitivity parameter for impact categories calculations. The assessment results showed that AlMg 3 -based scenario leads to higher impact categories compared to the postulated CFRP (53. 8 wt% CF) <b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario.</b> Additionally, results of the performed scenario analysis show ≈ 42 % reduction in energy intensity associated with the high-volume CFRP production (<b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario)</b> compared to the low-volume production scenario. All calculated impact categories associated with the low-volume production scenario exceed the corresponding impact categories associated with the high-volume production (<b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario).</b> For example, ozone depletion potential (ODP) for the low-volume production scenario is ≈ 20. 7 % higher than that of the high-volume production scenario and global warming potential (GWP) for the low-volume production scenario is ≈ 10. 2 % higher than that of the high-volume production scenario. This research also compares impact categories associated with recycled CF (rCF) from end-of-life (EOL) CFRP (with PP resin matrix) to those corresponding to rCF from EOL-CFRP (with EP resin matrix). Overall, the results of this research support its alternative hypothesis (H 1) which claims that replacing PE with PP in CFRP reduces the energy intensity and LCIA impact categories associated with CFRP production as well as rCF from EOL-CFRP. Finally, replacing fuselage’s AlMg 3 with CFRP in Boeing’s new aircraft fleet by 2035 (Boeing Market Outlook 2016 – 2035) will lead to an estimated global carbon footprint reduction of ≈ 1 x 10 ^ 6 tons CO 2 eq.

This leads to a multi-criteria selection problem for multi-alternatives. In this study, a multi-criteria assessment model was developed to rank different road transportation fuel-based vehicles (both renewable and non-renewable) using a method called Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment and Evaluations (PROMETHEE). This method combines qualitative and quantitative criteria to rank various alternatives. In this study, vehicles based on gasoline, gasoline-electric (hybrid), E 85 ethanol, diesel, B 100 biodiesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) were considered as alternatives. These alternatives were ranked based on five criteria: vehicle cost, fuel cost, distance between refueling stations, number of vehicle options available to the consumer, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit distance traveled.

ETM is an optimization global energy model which aims at providing the optimum energy system composition {{in terms of}} social wealth and sustainability including fusion as an alternative technology in the long term. Two framework scenarios are defined: a <b>Base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> with no limits to CO 2 emissions, and a 450 ppm scenario with a limit of 450 ppm in CO 2 -eq concentrations set by 2100. Previous results showed that in the <b>Base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario,</b> with no measures for CO 2 emission reductions, fusion does not enter the energy system. However, when CO 2 emission restrictions are imposed, the global energy system composition changes completely. In a 450 ppm scenario, coal technologies disappear in a few decades, being mainly replaced by nuclear fission technologies which experience a great increase when constrained only by Uranium resources exhaustion. Fission technologies are then replaced by the fusion power plants that start in 2070, with a significant contribution to the global electricity production by 2100. To conclude the work, a sensitivity analysis will be presented on some parameters that may affect the possible role of fusion in the future global energy system...|$|E

Furthermore, the approach developed in this study is not intended to provide definitive conclusions on the uncertainties related to the indoor CO 2 concentration but rather to target the most influential parameters on which it will be necessary to improve the knowledge (limiting the uncertainties). This study particularly points out the need for a more precise characterisation of the occupant behaviour. This characterisation could be inspired by methods developed in studies on the determinants of energy consumptions of the household sector [56, 57, 58, 59]. Moreover, future buildings will be built with some connected objects, such as thermostats or CO 2 sensors. These are potential solutions to develop the knowledge of occupant behaviour. But also, improving the knowledge of CO 2 in dwelling is a relevant subject for occupants to be able to interpret the importance of their measurements. Furthermore, other contaminants and indicators could be implemented to improve the characterisation of the IAQ. This way, more information would be provided on uncertainties related to the IAQ and other solutions to improve indoor air quality would be identified. Finally, the approach developed in this paper could be generalized at the building design phase, by focusing on reducing most influential parameters uncertainties.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems when considering the geologic storage of CO 2 is the risk of leakage which can lead to seepage from the storage area. The model described in this paper examines the injection of CO 2 into faulted reservoirs with some degree of compartmentalization. Presented here are analytical solutions to relate the transmissivity of a fault to the pressure responses in the compartments. The solutions also show the different groups of parameters influencing the migration of injected CO 2 in faulted areas that contain saline aquifers. The amount of cross-fault leakage that can occur is evaluated with respect to basic reservoir parameters that can be easily obtained prior to injection. The model is intended for a type of formation likely to be used for storage in Trinidad. We use the average reservoir pressure and an estimated fault transmissivity from the Mahogany field offshore Trinidad to illustrate the practical application of these analytical solutions. Fluid and rock properties influence the pressure response, and two possible cases are studied for their effects on the reservoir pressure and cross-fault flow. One case that is applicable is at early injection times, when {{on either side of the}} fault the water compressibility is dominant. The other case presents a more realistic case that treats the supercritical CO 2 as slightly compressible. A sensitivity analysis shows the effects of fault transmissivity, pore volume and fluid compressibilities.

These cases are (1) CO{sub 2 } sequestration <b>base</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> for 4, 000 -ft and 6, 200 -ft depth coal beds in the Lower Calvert Bluff Formation of east-central Texas, (2) sensitivity study of the effects of well spacing on sequestration, (3) sensitivity study of the effects of injection gas composition, (4) sensitivity study of the effects of injection rate, and (5) sensitivity study of the effects of coal dewatering prior to CO{sub 2 } injection/sequestration. Results show that, in most cases, revenue from coalbed methane production does not completely offset the costs of CO{sub 2 } sequestration in Texas low-rank coals, indicating that CO{sub 2 } injection is not economically feasible for the ranges of gas prices and carbon credits investigated. The best economic performance is obtained with flue gas (13 % CO{sub 2 } - 87 % N{sub 2 }) injection, as compared to injection of 100 % CO{sub 2 } and a mixture of 50 % CO{sub 2 } and 50 % N{sub 2 }. As part of technology transfer for this project, we presented results at the West Texas Geological Society Fall Symposium in October 2005 and at the COAL-SEQ Forum in November 2005...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} and functional impacts of PBS PVLS were quantified at network level using a life cycle costing approach. The assessment involved comparative {{analysis of the}} changes in agency and user costs associated with a number of <b>scenarios</b> with a <b>base</b> <b>case.</b> The <b>base</b> <b>case</b> included the current fleet, operating under GML and related pavement loading. The scenarios included different combinations of PBS vehicles with different take-up rates and their associated pavement loading. In developing the scenarios, it was assumed that the new PBS fleet will perform the same transport task as the current fleet it is replacing. Growth in freight task was applied for the <b>base</b> <b>case</b> and the <b>scenarios.</b> The assessment results indicated that the PBS PVLS requires further assessment to limit the overall wear caused by vehicles converting for volume gain and operating fully laden under PBS...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the current}} Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF) Performance Assessment (PA) revision, Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) vault closure cap {{degradation}} mechanisms and their impact upon filtration through the MSE vault closure cap were evaluated for the <b>base</b> <b>case</b> land use <b>scenario</b> (i. e. institutional control to pine forest). The degradation mechanisms evaluated included pine forest succession, erosion, and colloidal clay migration (Phifer 2003). Infiltration through the upper hydraulic barrier layer of the closure cap as determined by this evaluation will be utilized as the infiltration input to subsequent PORFLOW vadose zone contaminant transport modeling, which will also be performed as {{part of the}} PA revision...|$|R
