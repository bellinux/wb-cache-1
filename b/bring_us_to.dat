[...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-executive {{producer}} and staff writer Adam Horowitz stated that [...] "It's always interesting {{to pull back}} another layer {{on one of our}} characters, and to see another chapter in Juliet's story on the island and <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> where she is now was great", while fellow co-executive {{producer and}} staff writer Edward Kitsis thought that [...] "the interesting thing about the episode is the way Ben looks at Juliet ... everything is informed by that look." [...] Horowitz also enjoyed the juxtaposition of Juliet's character development with the revelations on the [...] "freighter folk". [...] Kitsis picked the episode's final scene where Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) discover that Ben has negotiated his release and will be dining with them that evening as his favorite of the episode. [...] Actress Rebecca Mader, who plays Charlotte, said that she was [...] "so excited" [...] for the episode to air because she thought that it was [...] "even better" [...] than the previous episode, which is widely {{regarded as one of the}} best episodes of the series. [...] Charlotte knocks Kate unconscious with the barrel of her gun and asks [...] "what?" [...] to a speechless Daniel in [...] "The Other Woman". [...] Mader found this hilarious and described it as [...] "the pinnacle of [...] career".|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taunton {{was founded}} by {{settlers}} from England and officially incorporated as a town on September 3, 1639. Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton in Somerset, England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, [...] "in honour and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, {{in the midst of}} the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us." [...] Prior to 1640, the Taunton area was called Cohannet, Tetiquet or Titiquet.|$|E
2500|$|Part of Horrobin's {{doctrine}} was {{his approval}} of a book which Wilson had censured. On 19 January 1722 John Stevenson, a layman of Balladoole, forwarded to Wilson {{a copy of the}} Independent Whig, 1721, which had been circulated in the island and sent to Stevenson by Richard Worthington for the public library. Wilson issued a pastoral letter to his clergy, bidding them excommunicate the [...] "agents and abettors" [...] of [...] "such-like blasphemous books". For suppressing the book Stevenson was imprisoned in Castle Rushen by Horne, who required Wilson to deliver up the volume as a condition of Stevenson's release. This he did under protest. When the book reached William Koss, the librarian, he said [...] "he would as soon take poison as receive that book into the library upon any other terms or conditions than immediately to burn it". Horrobin, on the other hand, affirmed that the work [...] "had rules and directions in it sufficient to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> heaven, if we could observe them".|$|E

2500|$|Tridentine editions {{prescribed}} that {{a prayer}} {{be said for}} the person who recited the Confiteor. After the priest's recitation, the server(s) prayed: [...] "Misereátur tui omnípotens Deus, et dimíssis peccátis tuis, perdúcat te ad vitam ætérnam" [...] (May Almighty God have mercy upon you and, your sins having been forgiven, may He bring you to eternal life). And the priest responded: [...] "Amen." [...] After the recitation by the server(s), the priest said the same prayer (with vestri and vestris, [...] "you" [...] plural, not [...] "you" [...] singular), and the server(s) answers: [...] "Amen." [...] In editions since 1970, in which the Confiteor is recited jointly, this prayer is said by the priest alone, replacing vestri and vestris ("you" [...] and [...] "your") with nostri and nostris ("us" [...] and [...] "our"). The official English translation is: [...] "May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> everlasting life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this novel, {{published}} by Arbor House/William Morrow in 1988, a man dying of AIDS is {{taken in by}} his cousin, a rancher in the Colorado mountains. Award-winning author Nancy Kress writes [...] "Michael Bishop has pulled off a rare and amazing feat. [...] Unicorn Mountain successfully weaves such traditional fantasy elements as unicorns and Indian lore together with the all-too-contemporary..." [...] Orson Scott Card writes [...] "The triumph of this, Bishop's most artistically whole and successful novel to date, is that {{he set out to}} do something that is nearly impossible in fiction: He wrote a novel about constructing a tribe...To do it, he had to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know and understand and care about more created characters than most writers produce in a career." [...] John Clute's assessment emphasizes another theme of the work: [...] "Michael Bishop, whose voice is like a shout {{from the bottom of the}} well of the enormous South, and whose heart is on his sleeve, [...] in Unicorn Mountain to generate a moving tale out of ecological disaster here and in another world, AIDS, the death of cultures, the death of species, and the slow sea-changing of America into themeparks." [...] The novel would go on to win the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was shortlisted for the 1989 Locus Award.|$|E
