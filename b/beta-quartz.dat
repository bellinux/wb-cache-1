5000|$|Evidences of {{the effect}} of {{lightning}} on rock are the presence of <b>beta-quartz</b> (T > , called [...] "flashstones" [...] by local diggers), melted barbed wires (T > [...] ); furrows in soils and colluvium up to 120 m long with the presence of cristobalite, the high-temperature modification of quartz (1713 - 18 °C F). In permeable Precambrian quartzites, the instantaneous shock rise of temperature from 15 to 1500 °C F, or higher, results in an extremely severe explosion-like expansion of water, leading to the formation of fissures and widening of other systems. The evidence points to lightning action, since quartz can change its modification from α to β and back again without cracking, as long as the temperature change is less than [...] per minute. For this reason, cracks caused by solar radiation or fire can be ruled out.|$|E

Coupled and decoupled vibrational modes were identified {{at room temperature}} {{as a function of}} composition. Tetrahedral tilting librational modes involved in the displacive alpha <b>beta-quartz</b> phase transition are decoupled. The wave number of the coupled A 1 mode located at 464 cm− 1 for pure alpha-quartz was found to vary quite linearly with germanium content. Raman spectra were recorded up to 1473 K. Substitution of germanium in the quartz lattice clearly improves the thermal stability of the alpha phase. The alpha <b>beta-quartz</b> phase transition temperature increases from 846 ± 1 K for x= 0 to about 1300 ± 50 K for x= 0. 24. At the same time, the dynamic disorder observed in quartz well below the transition is reduced in the solid solutions...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} in previous researches in this laboratory that <b>beta-quartz</b> is piezoelectric. This property suggests the feasibility of measuring the dynamic elastic constants for this substance utilizing the piezoelectric effect {{as a means for}} setting up vibrations. A method of measuring frequencies of vibration for parallelopipeds of beta-quarts is described. The technique involves driving the plates with a frequency modulated carrier and detecting beat notes which are amplified and placed on an oscilloscope screen for ease of observation. High order harmonics of the resonances are measured under conditions which permit the plates to be treated as having essentially infinite lateral dimensions. Characteristic values are computed and sufficient number of determinantal equations derived to completely resolve the five elastic constants for <b>beta-quartz</b> as a simultaneous solution. The values of these constants are listed in Table X which also contains all the known results of other experimenters for comparison...|$|E
40|$|Quartz {{obtained}} from structural materials (bricks, tiles, etc.) is often {{employed as a}} dosimeter using the thermoluminescence (TL) technique {{in the field of}} dating and retrospective dosimetry. As known, the TL response depends on the impurities in quartz lattice. For this motive, some members of <b>beta-quartz</b> series were synthesised using the ceramic method from precursor powders -Li 2 CO 3, Al(NO 3) 3. 9 H 2 O, Si(C 2 H 5 O) 4 - with different compositions, to create standard materials. The lattice of aluminosilicates consists of chains of SiO 4 and AlO 4 tetrahedra forming spirals or rings. The Al 3 + ions are replacing Si 4 + and a positive charge is needed (trapped holes or Na+, K+, Li+, etc. cations). The Li+ ions are placed in void channels inside the spirals of (Si, Al) O 4 tetrahedra. Here some characteristic features of the TL signal in three of <b>beta-quartz</b> with different concentrations of lithium-aluminium were measured in the UV-blue region of the spectrum. Irradiated -quartz samples display high linearity - one of the main features of a dosimeter - after additional radiation doses (from 0. 5 to 5 Gy). Peer Reviewe...|$|E

PIMD account for quantum fluctuations of atomic vibrations, which can modify material properties at temperatures below the Debye temperature. The difference between classical and quantum mechanical results for bond lengths, bond angles, elastic modulii, and some dynamical properties is calculated and comparison to experimental data is done. Only quantum mechanical simulations are able to reflect the correct thermomechanical properties below room temperature. It is discussed in how far classical and PIMD simulations can be helpful in constructing improved potential energy surfaces for silica. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to J. Chem. Phy...|$|E
40|$|The 'rigid unit mode' (RUM) model {{requires}} unit blocks, in {{our case}} tetrahedra of SiO_ 4 groups, to be rigid within first order of the displacements of the O-ions. The wave-vectors of the lattice vibrations, which obey this rigidity, are determined analytically. Lattices with inversion symmetry yield generically surfaces of RUMs in reciprocal space, whereas lattices without this symmetry yield generically lines of RUMs. Only in exceptional cases as in <b>beta-quartz</b> a surface of RUMs appears, if inversion symmetry is lacking. The occurence of planes and bending surfaces, straight and bent lines is discussed. Explicit calculations are performed for five modifications of SiO_ 2 crystals.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the phase {{diagram of the}} ``BKS'' potential [Van Beest, Kramer and van Santen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 1955 (1990) ], a model of silica widely used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We conduct MD simulations of the liquid, and three crystals (<b>beta-quartz,</b> coesite and stishovite) over wide ranges of temperature and density, and {{evaluate the}} total Gibbs free energy of each phase. The phase boundaries {{are determined by the}} intersection of these free energy surfaces. Not unexpectedly for a classical pair potential, our results reveal quantitative discrepancies between the locations of the BKS and real silica phase boundaries. At the same time, we find that the topology of the real phase diagram is reproduced, confirming that the BKS model provides a satisfactory qualitative description of a silica-like material. We also compare the phase boundaries with the locations of liquid-state thermodynamic anomalies identified in previous studies of the BKS model. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a series of heat treatments on the appearance and microstructure of Li 2 O-ZnO-Al 2 O 2 -SiO 2 glasses with varying ZnO/Li 2 O. The base glasses coloured yellowish, become violet at temperatures between 700 - 800 degrees C. The glass remains transparent and the obtained colour is stable during cooling. When heated at temperatures > 800 degrees C the samples become opaque violet and finally opaque white at 900 degrees C. The effect of the heat treatment on the physical and chemical properties of these materials is explained on the basis of changes in composition and morphology of the residual amorphous and crystalline phases. Electron microscopic observations individuated an initial glass nucleation induced by phase separation, which occurs at lower temperatures, followed at intermediate temperatures by the crystallisation of <b>beta-quartz</b> (ss) which at higher temperatures converts to beta-spodumene as shown by x-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. Mie light scattering as a consequence of phase separation have been proved to be responsible for bulk glass colouring. Besides microwave irradiation effects on the crystalline phases evolution has been explained on the basis of ionic diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Atomistic non-equilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of shock wave compression of quartz {{have been performed}} using the so-called BKS semi-empirical potential of van Beest, Kramer, and van Santen [Phys. Rev. B 43, 5068 (1991) ] to construct the Hugoniot of quartz. Our scheme mimics the real world experimental set up by using a flyer-plate impactor to initiate the shock wave and is the first shock wave simulation that uses a geometry optimised system of a polar slab in a three-dimensional system employing periodic boundary conditions. Our scheme also includes the relaxation of the surface dipole in the polar quartz slab which is an essential pre-requisite to a stable simulation. The original BKS potential is unsuited to shock wave calculations and so we propose a simple modification. With this modification, we find that our calculated Hugoniot is in good agreement with experimental shock wave data up to 25 GPa, but significantly diverges beyond this point. We conclude that our modified BKS potential is suitable for quartz under representative pressure conditions of the Earth core, but unsuitable for high-pressure shock wave simulations. We also find that the BKS potential incorrectly prefers the <b>beta-quartz</b> phase over the alpha-quartz phase at zero-temperature, {{and that there is}} a beta -> alpha phase-transition at 6 GPa...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} {{have been}} developed in which the elastic behaviour of the α-quartz and α-cristobalite molecular tetrahedral frameworks of both silica and germania are modelled by rotation, or dilation or concurrent rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra. Rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra both produce negative Poisson’s ratios (auxetic behaviour), whereas {{both positive and negative}} values are possible when these mechanisms act concurrently. Concurrent rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra reproduces with remarkable accuracy both the positive and negative nu 31 Poisson’s ratios observed in silica α-quartz and α-cristobalite, respectively, when loaded in the x 3 direction. A parametric fit of the concurrent model to the germania α-quartz experimental nu 31 Poisson’s ratio is used to predict nu 31 for germania α-cristobalite, for which no experimental value exists. This is predicted to be + 0. 007. Strain-dependent nu 31 trends, due to concurrent rotation and dilation in the silica structures, are in broad agreement with those predicted from pair-potential calculations, although significant differences do occur in the absolute values. Concurrent dilation and rotation of the tetrahedra predicts that an alternative uniaxial stress (sigma 3) -induced phase exists for both silica α-quartz and α-cristobalite and germania α-cristobalite, having geometries in reasonable agreement with <b>beta-quartz</b> and idealised beta-cristobalite, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL glow-curves of irradiated annealed and non-annealed synthetic <b>beta-quartz</b> (Li 0. 73 ¿l 0. 73 Si 1. 27 O 4) synthesized {{using the}} ceramic method {{have been studied}} Annealed samples (1200 °C for 12 h) exhibit some changes of shape and intensity in TL glow curves when compared with non-annealed samples {{in the range of}} 0. 05 - 5 Gy. These changes can be attributed to thermal alkali self-diffusion through the lattice interfaces and tilting of the Al-Si crankshafts involving modifications in the components of the luminescent traps. In non-annealed samples five groups of components at about 110 ºC, 180 ºC, 210 ºC, 325 ºC and 425 ºC can be found, whereas annealed samples only displays one very intense at ~ 900 º¿ and ¿ lower intensity second peak at ~ 240 ºC. In this paper, computerized curve-fitting based on general-order kinetics has been used to characterize the glow curve structure resolving trapping parameters for each glow peaks: trap depth (¿), frequency factor (s) and the order of the kinetics (b). The dose dependence of the individual components of the glow curve has been also studied. These data allow us to select the more stable component to be used for dosimetric purposes.

40|$|Quartz mylonites {{produced}} by intense ductile deformation in shear zones are often invoked as seismic reflectors {{in the lower}} continental crust. The seismic properties (Vp, Vsl, V., AV, and polarization planes of V,, and V=) have been calculated for five quartz mylonites that display typical lattice preferred orientations (LPOs). All specimens display considerable seismic anisotropy with V, anisotropy coefficients of between 8 and 12 per cent. There are good correlations between the LPO of the a-axes and the minimum V, direction, and the c-axes and the maximum V, direction. The other seismic properties are not reliable indicators of LPO. As the a-axis is the major flow direction in quartz, a correlation between the ductile flow direction and the V, minimum can be made. With increasing temperature and pressure alpha-quartz transforms to <b>beta-quartz.</b> In the beta field quartzites are seismically transverse isotropic. Furthermore there is a considerable increase in V, from 6 km s-l in the alpha field to nearly 7 km s- ' in the beta field. The transition is instantaneous and hence {{will result in a}} sharp seismic discontinuity with a reflection coefficient of- 0. 08 between pure aggregates of alpha and beta phases. However, under typical conditions of the continental crust the seismological importance of this phase transition will be limited by the presence of secondary minerals and partial melting.

40|$|Interfacial {{reactions}} between {{silica glass}} and tellurite melts were studied under confined {{conditions in the}} temperature regime of 400 - 700 degrees C, applying two different sampling techniques: isothermal heat-treatment of a several micrometer thick tellurite film, confined in a silica/tellurite/silica sandwich, and capillary filling of tellurite melts into silica microcapillaries. The sandwich technique provides detailed ex situ insights on the interface chemistry, microstructure and diffusion after given treatment times and temperatures. Data on dynamic viscosity, surface tension, wetting behaviour and eventual scaling effects {{was obtained from the}} capillary filling technique. For temperatures > 500 degrees C, silica is completely wet by the considered tellurite melts. At T > 600 degrees C and for a treatment time of 20 min or longer, cationic diffusion of Na(+) and Te(4 +) into the silica substrate occurs to a depth of several micrometers. At the same time, the tellurite melt attacks the silica surface, leading to the formation of a stationary silica-tellurite reaction layer and silica dissolution. Dissolved silica was observed to re-precipitate from the tellurite melt by liquid-liquid phase separation. In the early reaction stages, as a result of alkali diffusion into the silica substrate, <b>beta-quartz</b> crystallizes at the interface (what can be avoided by using alkali-free filling glasses). Obtained data set the boundary conditions for the generation of tellurite-silica all-solid fiber waveguides by melt infiltration of silica photonic crystal fibers or microcapillaries.

40|$|It {{has been}} assumed {{heretofore}} that the relatively large phase called [P bar] in records of near-by earthquakes in the continents is the direct longitudinal wave, {{and that the}} corresponding velocity of about 5. 6 km/sec is characteristic of the “granitic layer. ” This leads to contradiction with the calculated origin-time of transverse waves in earthquakes and cannot be reconciled with observations of the longitudinal waves from blasts. It seems {{more likely that the}} velocity of longitudinal waves below the sediments is about 6 km/sec, increases to 6 1 / 2 km/sec or more at a depth of roughly 10 km, and possibly decreases below a depth of between 10 and 15 km. Such a decrease in velocity is to be expected in rocks with an appreciable content of quartz, since in laboratory experiments a decrease of elastic constants of quartz with increasing temperature has been found approaching the temperature at which transformation from alpha- to <b>beta-quartz</b> occurs (corresponding to a depth of 25 km or more). At the bottom of a deeper layer with higher velocity (usually 7 - 7 1 / 2 km/sec) the Mohorovičić discontinuity at a depth of between 30 and 40 km, but deeper under some mountain chains, forms the boundary between the simatic crustal layers and the ultra-basic material below (wave velocity 8. 2 km/sec). Most earthquake foci seem to be in the hypothetical low-velocity layer. Geophysical and geological evidence indicates a greater difference between the structure of the Pacific basin and the surrounding continental areas than between the bottom of the Atlantic or Indian oceans and the surrounding shelves or continents. In the Pacific, the surface layers seem to consist of sediments, erupted and perhaps some simatic material. Below them is probably ultra-basic material with a boundary (Mohorovičić discontinuity) at a depth of only a few kilometers. In the Atlantic Ocean (and probably similarly the Indian Ocean) the transition from the continents to the basins seems to be more gradual, and the Mohorovičić discontinuity seems to be at greater depth than in the Pacific but much shallower than in the continents. While at present there is no indication of extensive sialic material {{in the bottom of the}} Pacific, there may be limited areas with sialic material at least in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean while relatively basic simatic (but not ultra-basic) material seems to be close to the surface at least in parts of the western Atlantic basin...|$|E
