25|$|From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was {{employed}} as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural <b>bacteriocides,</b> fungicides, and preservatives. However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces. One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had gained control of the island of Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The {{problem was that the}} glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with camouflage; canteen disinfectants; DDT to control malaria; and insulation for small electronics.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a brief review of the current {{knowledge}} regarding metabolism and toxicity of copper and copper-based pesticides in living organisms. Copper is an essential trace element in all living organisms (bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals), because it participates in different metabolic processes and maintain functions of organisms. The transport and metabolism of copper in living organisms is currently the subject of many studies. Copper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body via the complex of homeostatic processes, which provide organisms with a needed constant level of this micronutrient and avoid excessive amounts. Many aspects of copper homeostasis were studied at the molecular level. Copper based-pesticides, in particularly fungicides, <b>bacteriocides</b> and herbicides, are widely used in agricultural practice throughout the world. Copper is an integral part of antioxidant enzymes, particularly copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), and plays prominent roles in iron homeostasis. On the other hand, excess of copper in organism has deleterious effect, because it stimulates free radical production in the cell, induces lipid peroxidation, and disturbs the total antioxidant capacity of the body. The mechanisms of copper toxicity are discussed in this review also...|$|R
40|$|Organomercury {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used in medicinal applications. Alkoxyalkylmercurials {{have been used as}} fungicides and <b>bacteriocides</b> and, in addition, a range of diuretics containing substituted (betap-methoxyethyl) mercury(II) groups RCH(OMe) CH 2 Hg and CH 2 (OMe) CH(R) Hg, have been extensively used since the 1920 's. Theophylline is often administered in conjunction with the mercurial diuretics as its presence greatly enhances diuretic effectiveness, but the nature of any chemical reaction between organomercurials and theophylline has not been established. We report here the isolation of a crystalline complex from the reaction of (beta-methoxyethyl) mercury(II) acetate and theophylline, and a crystallographic determination of the binding site for mercury in the complex.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} microcin C 7 (McC) {{acts as a}} <b>bacteriocide</b> by inhibiting aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and stalling {{the protein}} translation machinery. McC is synthesized as a heptapeptide-nucleotide conjugate, which is processed by cellular peptidases within target strains to yield the biologically active compound. As unwanted processing of intact McC can result in self-toxicity, producing strains utilize multiple mechanisms for autoimmunity against processed McC. We have shown previously that the mccE gene within the biosynthetic cluster can inactivate processed McC by acetylating the antibiotic. Here, we present the characterization of this acetylation mechanism through biochemical and structural biological studies of the MccE acetyltransferase domain (MccEAcTase). We have also determined five crystal structures of the MccE-acetyl-CoA complex with bound substrates, inhibitor, and reaction product. The structural data reveal an unexpected mode of substrate recognition through π-stacking interactions {{similar to those found}} in cap-binding proteins and nucleotidyltransferases. These studies provide a rationale for the observation that MccEAcTase can detoxify a range of aminoacylnucleotides, including those that are structurally distinct from microcin C 7...|$|E

In a fish group challenged with the weakened-virulent bacteria (n= 30), infiltrated neutrophils markedly phagocytized bacteria at 17 hs post challenge, and bacteria-laden neutrophils were decreased whereas normal cells were markedly increased between 30 and 48 hs. On the other hand, in a fish group challenged with the high-virulent bacteria (n= 30), neutrophils phagocytized bacteria between 17 and 48 hs. Fragmented neutrophils were increased in two fish at 48 hs. Electron microscopy revealed phagocytized bacteria received marked {{damage in the}} cell wall followed by cellular digestion within the phagosomes, and formed secondary lysosomes in the cytoplasm in both fish groups. A small number of fragmented neutrophils allowed intracytoplasmic propagation of bacteria.

40|$|Abstract Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that bacteria are capable of creating specific redox conditions which are visible as species-specific continuous redox potential (Eh) measurements. It has been demonstrated that continuous measurements of Eh are valuable for tracking bacterial metabolic activities of bacterial species in liquid cultures. However, it remains uncertain whether this phenomenon is widespread among bacterial species and whether Eh mea-surements reflect similar mechanisms in more complex systems such as soils and sediments. The {{purpose of this study}} is therefore to evaluate whether bacteria that natu-rally occur in sediments have the capacity to control Eh and assess the relative partitioning of biological processes involved in Eh in natural sediments. To this end, continu-ous Eh measurements are linked to growth of bacteria in liquid cultures and bacterial metabolic activity in aquatic sediment microcosms containing the bioturbator Tubifex spp., in which we evaluate bacterial partitioning in microcosms treated with the <b>bacteriocide</b> formalin. The tested bacterial species (Micrococcus luteus, Paracoccus pantotrophus and Aminobacter aminovarans) appeared to have specific stable Eh signals during linear-exponential growth phase, suggesting that these species are capable of exerting an extracellular control on Eh measurements, thereby supporting the notion that species-specific Eh signals may be widespread among bacterial species. For-malin treatment reduced temporal variability of Eh in sediment microcosms. This outcome suggests that bacterial metabolism and inherent relative contributions of members of bacterial community principally determine development of Eh in sediment systems and that quantitation of sediment electrochemical properties may offer a potential indicator that characterizes bacterial processes...|$|E

The ubiquitous nature of the organism, coupled with its ability to colonise food-processing surfaces by forming biofilms, causes it to be of a major concern to the industry. Increased foodborne pathogen resistance and negative consumer perceptions {{regarding the use of}} synthetic <b>bacteriocides,</b> has resulted in natural antimicrobials being sourced from the plant kingdom. The listerial antibiofilm activities of Syzygium aromaticum (clove), Mentha spicata (spearmint), Lippia rehmannii and Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) essential oils and their major components were evaluated using the crystal violet assay and confocal scanning laser microscopy. Listerial biofilms treated with S. aromaticum or M. spicata essential oils, or the pure compounds nerol and citral, exhibited a similar biofilm biomass to the positive control. However, the essential oils of lemongrass, L. rehmannii, eugenol and R-carvone caused biofilm enhancement, rather than inhibition. L. rehmannii and lemongrass essential oils did not display any antibiofilm properties. Results obtained were confirmed by microscopic observations indicating either a reduction (inhibition) or an increase (enhancement) in biofilm biomass when exposed to the essential oils or pure compounds. The present study revealed that M. spicata and S. aromaticum essential oils as well as pure citral and nerol are good candidates for further development of ecofriendly disinfectants...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to isolate and {{identify}} aerobic bacteria associated with raw cattle hides and sheep skins and to examine their effect on tissue of hides and skins, in Gezira region. A total of 160 samples were collected. They were collected from slaughterhouse, warehouse and tannery. Samples collected were hides and skins treated with salt, washed and air dried. Samples taken 2 hours after slaughter and samples delivered without treatment. The bacterial damage was clear in {{raw hides and skins}} delivered without treatment. They showed signs of putrefaction, offensive odour and hair slipping. A number of bacteria were isolated. A number of bacteria were isolated also from traditional salted hides and skins and this was probably due to delay in curing and absence of <b>bacteriocides.</b> A number of bacteria were isolated from samples taken from washed and air dried hides and skins and samples 2 hours taken after slaughter, this probably due to poor hygiene, large number of labors and bad condition of collection room of raw hides and skins. A total of 414 organisms were isolated and consist of 379 Grampositive bacteria and 35 were Gram- negative bacteria. One hundred and thirty four bacterial strains were isolated from fresh and washed cattle hides and sheep skins in slaughterhouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Aerococcus homorri, Enterococcus casselifarus, Aerococcus viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gamella haemolysan, Stomococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. Also one hundred and sixty three strains were isolated from salted and dried cattle hides and sheep skins in warehouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus faecalis, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, Bacillus spp, Morexell bovis, Proteus vulgaris bigroup II, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli.

40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) is a corrosive {{and toxic}} gas, which poses serious health and operational risks when present in produced fluids such as condensate, gas and water. Therefore {{efforts have been}} made to remove H 2 S from the sour gas. In today’s world, {{there are a number of}} processes in use for treating “sour” gases containing the acid components H 2 S and CO 2. The goal of the present work is to study the reduction of Metachloronitrobenzene using Hydrogen sulphide and phase transfer catalyst and to study the effect of temperature, catalyst loading, concentration of reactants and temperature on the conversion and selectivity of the product. H 2 S is generally separated from the sour gas to produce elemental sulphur. This process is known as Claus process. Although elemental sulphur is produced, the cost of this process is high because it involves stripping of the H 2 S rich alkanolamine solution to give back the lean alkanolamine solution. However, if we use the absorbed H 2 S solution to produce other chemicals which are beneficial to the chemical industry, then we need not spend a lot on production of elemental sulphur. Chloroanilines are of great importance when it comes to the manufacturing of dyestuffs, drugs and various types of pesticides. Chlorhexidine, which is a very important antimicrobial and <b>bacteriocide</b> is produced from chloroanilines. It is important component of the chemicals required for producing various types of pesticides likemonolinuron,anilofos and chlorphthali.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate BiOWiSHTM-Aqua, a commercial dry solid formulation containing a consortium of bacteria and yeast, as a biopesticide for treatment of Botrytis cinerea, a gray mold that affects strawberries. BiOWiSHTM-Aqua was compared with another commercial product specifically used as a fungicide and <b>bacteriocide,</b> Serenade® Garden Disease Control Spray (concentrated Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713). Both laboratory tests {{as well as in}} vivo lab tests were conducted. BiOWiSHTM-Aqua results varied widely from plate to plate, regardless of experimental conditions. In some of these plates, inhibition zones were observed around colonies from BiOWiSHTM-Aqua, indicating efficacy. The organism responsible for the inhibition zones of B. cinerea growth was isolated from BiOWiSHTM-Aqua, and 16 s rRNA analysis identified this culture as a strain of B. subtilis. This strain was designated as B. subtilis ssp. KLB. The B. subtilis KLB concentration required to completely inhibit B. cinerea was 9. 1 x 104 CFU/mL when B. subtilis KLB was inoculated 48 hours before B. cinerea, 1. 3 x 105 CFU/mL at 24 hours, and 3. 2 x 106 CFU/mL when both were inoculated at the same time. Various preliminary experiments using B. subtilis KLB were also conducted to investigate its economic feasibility, to characterize the organism, and to test its post-harvest in vivo viability. B. subtilis KLB cell concentration was 1. 6 x 109 CFU/mL in a bioreactor with LB {{at the end of the}} log growth phase. B. subtilis KLB achieved cell concentrations as high as 5 x 109 CFU/mL in shake flasks with food-grade tapioca as a carbon source. Inoculation of B. subtilis KLB on post-harvest strawberries did not have an effect on Botrytis infection rates compared to the negative control. These various experiments were the first step in research to potentially produce B. subtilis KLB on a commercial scale...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobal {{drugs are}} {{chemotherapeutics}} {{with a wide}} spectrum of use in human and veterinary medicine and livestock practice. Beta-lactams are the most widespread group of antimicrobal drugs and are most often used in human and veterinary medicine in the treatment of bacterial infections due to their powerful antimicrobial activity and very low toxicity. They are divided into the groups of penicillins, cefalosporins and monobactams. Penicillins are obtained from the filtrate of the mould cultures Penicillium notatum and Penicillium chrysogenum, while cefalosporins are obtained from the filtrate of the actinomycete cultures (Cephalosporium acremonium). Research has lead to the discovery of active groups of 6 -amino-penicillin acids, whose isolation has made it possible to produce semi-synthetic penicillins that have surpassed the limitations of natural penicillin G. The physico-chemical properties of the beta-lactams can be altered by substituting hydrogen in the carboxyl group of penicillins, i. e. in modifying the side chain of cefalosporin. This increases the resistance to the activity of β-lactamase and expands the spectrum of activity. Beta-lactams, in therapy concentrations, act as a <b>bacteriocide</b> by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Penicillins are important for antibacterial chemotherapy, often in combination with other antimicrobal drugs. Cefalosporins are usually used as a replacement for penicillin in treating infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and in prophylaxis for surgery. The use of beta-lactams in animals used for food can result in the residues of these drugs in meat and meat products or milk and eggs. The introduction of antimicrobal drugs in the human body via food is particularly dangerous due to their direct toxicity or carcinogenicity, influences on the composition of the intestinal microflora, possible allergic reactions in sensitive people, and the appearance of resistance of individual pathogenic microorganisms, and therefore their determination is necessary. Considering that they are widely used in the treatment of mastitis, they are the most commonly determined antimicrobal drugs in milk. For the purpose of determining the residues of beta-lactams in food of animal origin, microbiological screening methods are used, and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry is most often used for identification and quantification...|$|E
