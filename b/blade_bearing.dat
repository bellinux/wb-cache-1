40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{involving an}} in-service {{failure of a}} “variable pitch in motion” fan’s <b>blade</b> <b>bearing.</b> Variable pitch in motion fans rotate at a constant speed, with the changing blade angle varying the load. A pitch-change mechanism facilitates the change in blade angle. A <b>blade</b> <b>bearing</b> supports each blade enabling it to rotate. The author observed that as the fan aerodynamic stage loading progressively increased, so did the rate of blade-bearing wear. The reported research addressed two separate, but linked, needs. First, the ongoing need to increase fan pressure development capability required an increase in fan loading. This increase was {{within the context of}} an erosive operating regime which systematically reduced fan pressure development capability. The second need was to identify the root cause of blade-bearing failures. The author addressed the linked needs using a computational analysis, improving the rotor inflow aerodynamic characteristics through an analysis of the inlet box and design of inlet guide vanes to control flow nonuniformities at the fan inlet. The results of the improvement facilitated both an increase in fan-pressure-developing capability and identification of the root cause of the blade-bearing failures...|$|E

40|$|Typical damage {{modes of}} rotor <b>blade</b> <b>bearings</b> are mainly related to {{oscillating}} movements with small angles under high loads. Under these conditions, the lubrication film between rollers and raceways of the bearings tends to collapse, which causes metal to metal contact and surface induced damage. Since established calculation methods for lifetime prediction are unsuitable for wind turbine <b>blade</b> <b>bearings,</b> full-scale test rigs are developed to close this particular knowledge gap. To generate realistic boundary conditions for bearing tests, the stiffness of the interfaces such as blade and hub {{have to be}} investigated. Because of the disadvantages of using real components within these test rigs, a possible solution is to use substitute components which aim to emulate the interface behaviour of the real components. This paper presents a method to derive a substitute of a rotor hub based on a FE-model of the virtual IWT 7. 5 - 164 research turbine.

40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, <b>blade</b> carrier <b>bearings</b> and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and <b>blade</b> carrier <b>bearings</b> and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and <b>blade</b> carrier <b>bearings,</b> crank disk and <b>blade</b> carrier <b>bearings.</b> Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, <b>blade</b> carrier <b>bearings</b> and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|R

After initiation, the crack has propagated progressively over about 40 to 50 % of the blade cross section before giving way to final static overload fracture. Examination revealed delamination/cracking of the coating at the fatigue crack origin. A few intergranular cracks were also found present in the blade material in this region. Evidences suggest that most probably, the cracks got generated first in the coating and in the adjacent region of the blade material, and the stress raisers thus resulted were responsible for the subsequent transgranular fatigue crack initiation. It needs to be examined whether or not the past history of the engine has any influence on the initial crack generation in the coating and the blade material.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} a wind turbine to react to rapid {{fluctuations}} in wind velocity is blunted by the massive rotational inertia of the rotor assembly as a whole, {{as well as the}} mass of individual <b>blades</b> <b>bearing</b> upon pitch change mechanisms. Thus, wind turbines often operate with a less than optimal relationship to the instantaneous wind conditions. A wind turbine interacting with slow fluctuations in wind velocity may suffer a loss in potential energy extraction due to stalling of the blades. Interaction with rapid fluctuations in wind velocity can subject a wind turbine to the phenomenon of dynamic stall, which produces severe variations in the aerodynamic loads upon the blades resulting in major structural issues. Flow separation is a major contributing factor to the aerodynamic challenges associated with wind turbine operation. The ability to control or reduce the magnitude of regions of separated flow over an airfoil can {{play a significant role in}} reducing the negative effects associated with turbine operations in fluctuating wind conditions. The use of Air Jet Vortex Generators (AJVG) has been shown to provide net increases in power output on full scale turbines. In addition, AJVG's have been shown experimentally to reduce the fluctuating aerodynamic loads associated with dynamic stall. Such devices are ideal for use in rapidly fluctuating conditions, as there is potential for an active flow control technique with a rapid response time which would be more difficult to achieve with fixed Vane Vortex Generators (VVG). The current work details experiments carried out with a new type of AJVG that has proven to consume less energy compared with traditional devices. The use of such a device on full scale wind turbines may lead to greater net gains in power output, as well as reducing the magnitude of aerodynamic loads associated with dynamic stall...|$|R
