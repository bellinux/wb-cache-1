40|$|Abstract Background A {{relatively}} {{high incidence of}} pathological conditions in retrieved femoral heads, including a group of patients having low grade B-cell lymphoma, has been described before. At short term follow up none of these patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma showed evidence of systemic disease. However, the long term follow up of these patients is not known. Methods From November 1994 {{up to and including}} December 2005 we screened all femoral heads removed at the time of primary total hip replacement histopathologically and included them in the <b>bone</b> <b>banking</b> protocol according to the guidelines of the American Associations of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the European Association of Musculo-Skeletal Transplantation (EAMST). We determined the percentage of B-cell lymphoma in all femoral heads and in the group that fulfilled all criteria of the <b>bone</b> <b>banking</b> protocol and report on the long-term follow-up. Results Of 852 femoral heads fourteen (1. 6 %) were highly suspicious for low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Of these 852 femoral heads, 504 were eligible for bone transplantation according to the guidelines of the AATB and the EAMST. Six femoral heads of this group of 504 were highly suspicious for low-grade B-cell lymphoma (1. 2 %). At long term follow up two (0. 2 %) of all patients developed systemic malignant disease and one of them needed medical treatment for her condition. Conclusion In routine histopathological screening we found variable numbers of low-grade B-cell lymphoma throughout the years, even in a group of femoral heads that were eligible for bone transplantation. Allogenic transmission of malignancy has not yet been reported on, but surviving viruses are proven to be transmissible. Therefore, we recommend the routine histopathological evaluation of all femoral heads removed at primary total hip arthroplasty as a tool for quality control, whether the femoral head is used for <b>bone</b> <b>banking</b> or not. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the amount of bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP- 7) in bone samples in different storage and treatment conditions used in <b>bone</b> <b>banks</b> and thereby evaluate the benefit of this test as a routine measure before bone grafting. Methods Fresh as well as frozen bone chips, each with and without antibiotic impregnation, were screened for theirBMP- 7 content. Human bone chips were produced from femoral heads of two female donors who had undergone total hip replacement surgery. The amount of BMP- 7 was detected using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Results There were no significant differences between groups in samples obtained from the first femoral head. Bone-chip samples derived from the second femoral head showed significant differences between groups. The actual amount of these differences was small and most likely biologically irrelevant. It is important to note that there was a significant difference between groups when comparing both femoral heads, reflecting donor-to-donor variability. Conclusion ELISA testing for BMP- 7 as a qualitative measurement of bone grafts should be considered a routine quality-control test for <b>bone</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bone allografts are {{a useful}} and {{sometimes}} indispensable {{tool for the}} surgeon to repair bone defects. Microbial contamination is {{a major reason for}} discarding allografts from <b>bone</b> <b>banks.</b> To improve the number of safe allografts, we suggest chemical cleaning of the grafts followed by antibiotic impregnation. Comparison of two chemical cleaning processes for bone allografts aiming for antibiotic impregnation and consequently delivery rates in vitro. Bone chips of 5 – 10 mm were prepared from human femoral heads. Two cleaning methods (cleaning A and cleaning B) based on solutions containing hydrogen peroxide, paracetic acid, ethanol and biological detergent were carried out and compared. After the cleaning processes, the bone chips were impregnated with gentamicin. Bacillus subtilis bioassay was used to determine the gentamicin release after intervals of 1 – 7 days. Differences were compared with non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests. The zones of inhibition obtained from the bone grafts cleaned with both cleaning processes were similar between the groups. The concentration of the released antibiotic was decreasing gradually over time, following a similar pattern for both groups. The cleaning procedure A as well as the cleaning procedure B for bone allografts allowed the impregnation with gentamicin powder in the same concentrations in both groups. The delivery of gentamicin was similar for both groups. Both cleaning procedures were easy to be carried out, making them suitable for routine use at the <b>bone</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND:Bone allografts carry {{a risk of}} infection, so {{terminal}} sterilization by gamma irradiation at 25 kGy is recommended; but is deleterious to bone quality. Contemporary <b>bone</b> <b>banking</b> significantly reduces initial allograft bioburden, questioning the need to sterilize at 25 kGy. METHODS:We inoculated allograft bone with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus pumilus, then exposed them to gamma irradiation at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 kGy. Mechanical and biological properties of allografts were also assessed. Our aim was to determine an optimal dose that achieves sterility assurance while minimizing deleterious effects on allograft tissue. RESULTS: 20 - 25 kGy eliminated both organisms at concentrations from 101 to 103 CFU, while 10 - 15 kGy sterilized bone samples to a bioburden concentration of 102 CFU. Irradiation did not generate pro-inflammatory bone surfaces, as evidenced by macrophage activation, nor did it affect attachment or proliferation of osteoblasts. At doses = 10 kGy, the toughness of cortical bone was reduced (P< 0. 05), and attachment and fusion of osteoclasts onto irradiated bone declined at 20 and 25 kGy (P< 0. 05). There was no change in collagen cross-links, but a significant dose-response increase in denatured collagen (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS:Our mechanical and cell biological data converge on 15 kGy as a threshold for radiation sterilization of bone allografts. Between 5 and 15 kGy, <b>bone</b> <b>banks</b> can undertake validation that provides allografts with an acceptable sterility assurance level, improving their strength and biocompatibility significantly. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The application of radiation sterilization doses between 5 and 15 kGy will improve bone allograft mechanical performance and promote integration, while retaining sterility assurance levels. Improved quality of allograft bone will promote superior clinical outcomes. Griffith Health, School of Medical ScienceFull Tex...|$|R

50|$|Allograft bone, like {{autogenous}} bone, {{is derived}} from humans; {{the difference is that}} allograft is harvested from an individual other than the one receiving the graft. Allograft bone can be taken from cadavers that have donated their bone {{so that it can be}} used for living people who are in need of it; it is typically sourced from a <b>bone</b> <b>bank.</b> Bone banks also supply allograft bone sourced from living human bone donors (usually hospital inpatients) who are undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (total hip replacement surgery). During total hip replacement, the orthopaedic surgeon removes the patient's femoral head, as a necessary part of the process of inserting the artificial hip prosthesis. The femoral head is a roughly spherical area of bone, located at the proximal end of the femur, with a diameter of 45 mm to 56 mm in adult humans. The patient's femoral head is most frequently discarded to hospital waste at the end of the surgical procedure. However, if a patient satisfies a number of stringent regulatory, medical and social history criteria, and provides informed consent, their femoral head may be deposited in the hospital's <b>bone</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E

Most bone grafts are expected to be reabsorbed and replaced as the natural bone heals over a few months’ time.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in demand for allograft bone in recent years. This type of bone provides an excellent material to fill in bony defects, but could be associated with an incidence of infection. Any newly established tissue bank has to meet the very stringent criteria to process and store bone and maintain a donor and recipient database to avoid transmission of infection. The Sheffield Tissue Bank has been functioning since 1989 and until 1993 has provided bone allografts to 220 patients; these have been used mainly to reconstruct defects at revision hip and knee arthroplasty and for scoliosis surgery. There have been no cases of disease transmission and the rate of infection has been reduced by strict screening protocols.

We are not trying to find the most optimal polyaffine model of the femur, but the simplest model with a minimal number of parameters. There is no need to optimize for different number of regions, boundaries and choice of weights, since this fine tuning will be done automatically by a final demons relaxation step with Gaussian smoothing.

40|$|ABSTRACTBone {{banks are}} {{necessary}} for providing biological material {{for a series of}} orthopedic procedures. The growing need for musculoskeletal tissues for transplantation has been due to the development of new surgical techniques, and this has led to a situation in which a variety of hospital services have been willing to have their own source of tissue for transplantation. To increase the safety of transplanted tissues, standards for <b>bone</b> <b>bank</b> operation have been imposed by the government, which has limited the number of authorized institutions. The good performance in a <b>bone</b> <b>bank</b> depends on strict control over all stages, including: formation of well-trained harvesting teams; donor selection; conducting various tests on the tissues obtained; and strict control over the processing techniques used.
