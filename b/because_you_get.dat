Believing the novel's language to be [...] "far more arcane than in [...] later books," [...] Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the [...] "elegance and wit of the original." [...] She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had [...] "a lot of good stuff in it" [...] but needed to be edited, and second drafts would [...] "almost certainly be rubbish... <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into a panic." [...] Thompson credits Doran for [...] "help me, nourish me and mentor me through that process... I learned about screenwriting at her feet." ...|$|E

Her final question was whether experience or education serves a person better in life to which she answered [...] "Definitely experience <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> your knowledge through experience." [...] She competed on the platform of integrating people with mental challenges into society. [...] In the nationally televised pageant, {{she became the first}} woman from Missouri to win the Miss USA title. During her reign as Miss USA, Finnessey became an advocate for breast cancer and ovarian cancer awareness and research.

Finnessey resided in a luxury Riverside Drive apartment in New York City provided by the Miss Universe Organization and pageant co-owner Donald Trump.|$|E
500|$|Both the {{physical}} appearance {{and behavior of}} Henry and Sam were designed to reflect that of Joel and Ellie; the backpack and jeans worn by both duos reflect {{the physical}} resemblance, while the behavioral resemblance was {{in that they are}} both forced to make tough decisions over time. After Brandon Scott was chosen to portray Henry, the team only showed him some artistic sketches of the game, avoiding specific details about the story. Scott enjoyed portraying the character, particularly {{due to the fact that}} he was allowed to introduce elements of his own personality. [...] "You don't have to plan ... <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to just be the character," [...] Scott said. He also felt that recording the voice and actions simultaneously was [...] "exciting" [...] and helpful. The team felt that Henry's actions are dedicated to protecting Sam, and that Scott introduced that dedication to the character. Druckmann stated that Henry and Sam's relationship mirrored that of Joel and Ellie's. Ellie was seen by the team as a mentor to Sam. Johnson felt that Sam was [...] "genuinely scared", admiring this significant difference from the game's other characters.|$|E

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's {{not a good idea to}} have a lot of people around <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E

Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.
