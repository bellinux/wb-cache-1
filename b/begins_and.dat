5|$|Interstate37 starts {{near the}} Gulf Coast in Corpus Christi and heads {{northwest}} toward San Antonio. It links South Texas {{to the northern}} {{parts of the state}} via I-69E, US77, and US281. The highway functions {{as one of the few}} freeway hurricane evacuation routes for the southern Texas coast. It roughly parallels US 181, which both <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> ends at I-37, and US 281.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E

5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form. The main sections (A and B) are contrasted in key and character, A is slow and meditative; B is more intense and animated. The movement <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> ends slowly and quietly.|$|E
5|$|The A49 {{also goes}} to Shrewsbury, joining the A5 {{at the south}} of the town, coming from Ludlow and Leominster. At this point the road merges with the A5 for , before {{separating}} again to the east of the town. From there it runs north, passing Sundorne, then Battlefield, before heading out towards Whitchurch. At Battlefield, the A53 route <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> heads northeast towards Shawbury and Market Drayton then onwards towards Newcastle-under-Lyme and Stoke-on-Trent.|$|E
5|$|The road then {{approaches}} the Warrendale toll plaza, where toll ticketing <b>begins,</b> <b>and</b> continues southeast to an interchange with PA8 in Hampton Township. The turnpike then {{comes to the}} Allegheny Valley exit in Harmar Township, which provides access to PA28 via Freeport Road. East of this interchange, the road heads south and crosses the Allegheny River on the six-lane Allegheny River Turnpike Bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Sanskrit term {{is composed}} of two letters, {{the first and the}} last of the Sanskrit alphabet. Together, they symbolically represent the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> the end of all things. In Japanese Mikkyō Buddhism, the letters represent the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> the end of the universe. [...] This appears in Greek as Alpha-Omega, similarly adopted by Christianity to symbolize Christ as the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of all.|$|R

5|$|The {{structure}} of the piece is unusually symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text. Harmonically, the piece <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> ends in C major, and the central movement is in D minor. The second movement modulates from A minor to F major, while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} Center Street (Route 150) {{near the}} Wallingford train station, the road becomes North Colony Street and heads {{out of the}} town center. The road crosses Route 68 at a grade-separated junction about two miles (three km) later, followed {{by a series of}} junctions about half a mile (0.8km) apart each: an interchange with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (at exit 66), a split to the left where Route 71 <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> a merge from the left where Route 150 ends.|$|E
30|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of each curve (different numbers for each measurement as implied below) led to {{the determination of the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end number for each curve and measurement. Thereafter by simply averaging the velocities within the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end number we calculated the mean velocity (apparently for each curve and measurement). It is noted that the velocity of each measurement at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of each curve was calculated with linear regression of the values right before and right after the curve implying that the trajectory and hence the variation of the velocity between two consecutive points, is linear.|$|R

5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
5|$|At 13thStreet, NY32 leaves Broadway {{and follows}} 13th two blocks west to an {{intersection}} with 2ndAvenue. Here, NY155 <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> occupies 13th Street {{to the west}} of 2nd Avenue while NY32 turns north onto 2nd. NY32 continues in the vicinity of I-787 and its continuation, NY787, through Watervliet and back into the town of Colonie, this time it is through the hamlet of Maplewood, to Cohoes, where NY787 ends at NY32 near the convergence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers at New Courtland Street. Past NY787, NY32 crosses the Mohawk River into Saratoga County and the town of Waterford, after crossing into the village of Waterford NY32 crosses the Erie Canal before intersecting US4 {{in the heart of the}} village. The two routes merge, forming an overlap northward along the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|At a {{party in}} the Great Northern to welcome the new investors, Benjamin and Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{secretly}} discuss their plan to burn the town's sawmill and buy the land cheaply. Leland begins sobbing hysterically when {{a piece of music}} <b>begins,</b> <b>and</b> Martell escorts him away. Meanwhile, Shelly waits at home with her gun, as Johnson arrives back. Hank attacks him beside his truck, threatening him; Johnson returns home and lashes out at Shelly, and she draws the gun and shoots him.|$|E
30|$|Two {{research}} questions guided this study: (1) Is district Pre-K attendance {{associated with a}} significant difference in letter–sound identification and word identification during the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle of first grade? (2) Is district Pre-K attendance associated with {{a significant difference in}} text-level reading ability during the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle of first grade? It was hypothesized that literacy achievement among Pre-K attendees would be higher during the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle of first grade, compared to the no-preschool group, for each literacy measure administered.|$|R
50|$|Note: the {{deletion}} of the Om syllable in the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> {{addition of}} the Hrīh syllable is an adaptation. Hrīh signifies the element metal and lungs. The placement of Avalokiteśvara at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end obviously signifies that the other deities are contained within Avalokiteśvara.|$|R

The war <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> in the early days, Bhishma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasena who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjuna afterwards.|$|E

By 2009, Feshbach had become a high-ranking spokesperson for the Scientology organization.|$|E
5|$|I'll be {{offering}} my vision when my campaign <b>begins.</b> <b>And</b> {{it will be}} comprehensive and sweeping. And I {{hope that it will}} be compelling enough to draw people toward it.

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper <b>begins</b> <b>and</b> ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session <b>begins,</b> <b>and</b> formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and {{is followed by a}} general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an early election.|$|E
