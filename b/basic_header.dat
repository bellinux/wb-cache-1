5000|$|Packets {{are sent}} over a TCP {{connection}} which are established first between client and server. They contain a header {{and a body}} which, {{in the case of}} connection and control commands, is encoded using the Action Message Format (AMF). The header is split into the <b>Basic</b> <b>Header</b> (shown as detached from the rest, in the diagram) and Chunk Message Header. The <b>Basic</b> <b>Header</b> is the only constant part of the packet and is usually composed of a single composite byte, where the 2 most significant bits are the Chunk Type (fmt in the specification) and the rest form the Stream ID. Depending on the value of the former, some fields of the Message Header can be omitted and their value derived from previous packets while depending on the value of the latter, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Header</b> can be extended with 2 or 3 extra bytes (as {{in the case of the}} diagramme that has 3 bytes in total (c)). If the value of the remaining 6 bits of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Header</b> (BH) (least significant) is 0 then the BH is of 2 bytes and represents from Stream ID 64 to 319 (64+255); if the value is 1, then the BH is of 3 bytes (last 2 bytes encoded as 16bit Little Endian) and represents from Stream ID 64 to 65599 (64+65535); if the value is 2, then BH is of 1 byte and is reserved for low-level protocol control messages and commands. The Chunk Message Header contains meta-data information such as the message size (measured in bytes), the Timestamp Delta and Message Type. This last value is a single byte and defines whether the packet is an audio, video, command or [...] "low level" [...] RTMP packet such as an RTMP Ping.|$|E

Due to IPv 6 Agreement is the agreement for the next generation network and the core of it, IPHC header compression technology provides IPv 6 <b>basic</b> <b>headers</b> and expanding headers with a good support, so we adopt IPHC header compression scheme which groups the data that need to transmitting, introduce retransmission mechanism and header request mechanism to make IPHC have much compression effect on headers. But IPHC header compression scheme is hard on signal channel, it required that loss rate of transportation link is a little lower. In order to let IPHC better adapt to wireless link, compression based on link state is offered: Using simple portioned Markov model to check channel error rate, adopting RTS/CTS access mechanism to search for link state. Apply OPNET simulation software to imitate and finally achieve the desired target. In past two decades, computer network got rapid development, with the application of computers wider and wider. But because of being limited by areas and time, users couldn’t surf on the Internet, communicate with each other, and transport messages at any time and at any place. In this case, the wireless network developed, wireless network technology also produced therewith. Compute...|$|R

Since options must always be inspected routers, it is generally believed that routers prioritize ordinary packets over packets carrying options in a way that significantly impacts the performance of options. This article presents an experiment based on end-to-end probing using UDP packets, capturing the performance penalties associated with IPv 4 options. Analysis of experiment results quantifies the impact of IPv 4 options on forwarding performance in terms of delay, jitter and loss rate. From the analysis it can be concluded that there is a slight increase in delay and jitter and severely increased loss rate. Godkänd; 2004; 20071207 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|Wireless is {{becoming}} a popular way to connect mobile computers to the Internet and other networks. The bandwidth of wireless links will probably always be limited due to properties of the physical medium and regulatory limits {{on the use of}} frequencies for radio communication. Therefore, it is necessary for network protocols to utilize the available bandwidth efficiently. Headers of IP packets are growing and the bandwidth required for transmitting headers is increasing. With the coming of IPv 6 the address size increases from 4 to 16 bytes and the <b>basic</b> IP <b>header</b> increases from 20 to 40 bytes. Moreover, most mobility schemes tunnel packets addressed to mobile hosts by adding an extra IP header or extra routing information, typically increasing the size of TCP/IPv 4 headers to 60 bytes and TCP/IPv 6 headers to 100 bytes. In this paper, we provide new header compression schemes for UDP/IP and TCP/IP protocols. We show how {{to reduce the size of}} UDP/IP headers by an order of magnitude, down t [...] .

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of wireless and mobile network infrastructures and capabilities, {{a wide range of}} exploitable vulnerabilities emerges due to the use of multivendor and multidomain cross-network services for signaling and transport of Internet- and wireless-based data. Consequently, the rates and types of cyber-attacks have grown considerably and current security countermeasures for protecting information and communication may be no longer sufficient. In this paper, we investigate a novel methodology based on multicriterion decision making and fuzzy classification that can provide a viable second-line of defense for mitigating cyber-attacks. The proposed approach has the advantage of dealing with various types and sizes of attributes related to network traffic such as <b>basic</b> packet <b>headers,</b> content, and time. To increase the effectiveness and construct optimal models, we augmented the proposed approach with a genetic attribute selection strategy. This allows efficient and simpler models which can be replicated at various network components to cooperatively detect and report malicious behaviors. Using three datasets covering a variety of network attacks, the performance enhancements due to the proposed approach are manifested in terms of detection errors and model construction times...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} analyze the effect of {{manufacturing}} defects and inlet header design {{on the effectiveness of}} heat exchangers. A commercial computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT 5. 4, was used to numerically simulate individual and pairs of passages as well as sections of an inlet header and heat-exchanger core. The one- and two passage models show that the four representative manufacturing defects do not have a large impact on overall effectiveness, even when the defects are quite large relative to the passage dimensions. The core and header sections showed that the <b>basic</b> <b>header</b> contour and the angle of the incoming flow as well as the pressure drop through the core {{have a significant impact on}} the flow distribution. Small variations in the header dimensions and the core/header aspect ratio have little effect on the effectiveness. Decreasing the angle the incoming flow turns through and increasing the pressure drop through the core both create a more even flow distribution through the heat exchanger, hence increasing its effectiveness. by Charles Booten.

According to the experiment of applying numerous Chinese e-mails to our spam filtering method, we obtain the following excellent datums: the Accuracy is 96. 5 %, the Precision is 96. 67 %, and the Recall is 96. 3 %. Thus, the method proposed in this paper can efficiently identify the spam e-mails by checking only the header sessions, which can reduce the cost for calculation...|$|R
50|$|Over ATM/DSL (aka PPPoEoA): The {{amount of}} {{overhead}} added by PPPoEoA on a DSL link {{depends on the}} packet size because of (i) the absorbing effect of ATM cell-padding (discussed below), which completely cancels out additional overhead of PPPoEoA in some cases, (ii) PPPoEoA + AAL5 overhead which can cause an entire additional 53-byte ATM cell to be required, and (iii) {{in the case of}} IP packets, PPPoE overhead added to packets that are near maximum length (‘MRU’) may cause IP fragmentation, which also involves the first two considerations for both of the resulting IP fragments. However ignoring ATM and IP fragmentation for the moment, the <b>basic</b> additional protocol <b>header</b> overheads for AAL5 payload due to choosing PPP + PPPoEoA are: 2 bytes (for PPP) + 6 (for PPPoE) + 18 (Ethernet MAC, variable) + 10 (RFC 2684 LLC, variable) = 36 bytes. This overhead is that obtained when using the LLC header option described in RFC 2684 for PPPoEoA.|$|R

This paper explores a new countermeasure approach for anomaly-based intrusion detection using a multicriterion fuzzy classification method combined with a greedy attribute selection. The proposed approach {{has the advantage of}} dealing with various types of attributes including network traffic <b>basic</b> TCP/IP packet <b>headers,</b> as well as content-based, time-based and host-based attributes. At the same time, to reduce the dimensionality and increase the computational efficiency, the greedy attribute selection algorithm enables it to choose an optimal subset of attributes that is most relevant for detecting intrusive events. The simplicity of the constructed model allows it to be replicated at various network components in emerging open system infrastructures such as sensor networks, wireless ad hoc networks, cloud computing, and smart grids. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared on a commonly-used intrusion detection benchmark dataset. The results show more than 99. 9 % overall accuracy with high detection rates for various types of intrusions can be achieved with about 26 % only of the available attributes...|$|R
