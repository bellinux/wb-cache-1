5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or <b>bounce</b> shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The <b>bounce</b> or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it <b>bounce</b> or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gallup Organization, Obama {{began his}} {{presidency}} with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining {{for the rest}} of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll <b>bounce</b> shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This <b>bounce</b> lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.|$|E

40|$|We present herebelow a {{model for}} <b>bouncing</b> {{droplets}} consisting of two masses joined by a spring and a damper <b>bouncing</b> onto an oscillating plate. We analyze the dynamics through the <b>bouncing</b> threshold and spatio-temporal diagrams. We obtain an analytic expression for the threshold. Resonance and Anti-resonance phenomena are found and investigated. The behavior of the <b>bouncing</b> spring is compared to the <b>bouncing</b> droplet dynamics. In particular, key features of the <b>bouncing</b> droplet dynamics are reproduced...|$|R

5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a <b>bounce</b> dive the diver descends {{directly to}} the maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends {{directly to the}} surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a <b>bounce</b> dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not relevant in this usage.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the <b>bouncing</b> ball {{has been}} a popular theme in {{computer}} demo effects since the 1950s, when a <b>bouncing</b> ball demo was released for Whirlwind computers. It later became the primary theme for the early Atari games Pong and Breakout. Commodore released a <b>bouncing</b> ball demo at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time animation showing a red-and-white spinning ball <b>bouncing</b> and casting a shadow, this <b>bouncing</b> ball became the official logo of the Amiga company. Within the context of this tradition of <b>bouncing</b> ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a <b>Bouncing</b> Ball demo for the Atari VCS/2600, with a spinning and <b>bouncing</b> ball, at the same event. Following these semi-official demonstrations, the <b>bouncing</b> ball theme has reappeared in various demoscene productions.|$|R

5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to <b>bounce</b> out of the bag, jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to <b>bounce</b> and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E

40|$|In recent {{laboratory}} studies the robustness of a <b>bouncing</b> barrier in planetesimal formation was studied with an ensemble of preformed compact mm-sized aggregates. Here {{we show that}} a <b>bouncing</b> barrier indeed evolves self-consistently by hit-and-stick from an ensemble of smaller dust aggregates. In addition, we feed small aggregates to an ensemble of larger <b>bouncing</b> aggregates. The stickiness temporarily increases, but the final number of aggregates still <b>bouncing</b> remains the same. However, feeding on the small particle supply, {{the size of the}} <b>bouncing</b> aggregates increases. This suggests that {{in the presence of a}} dust reservoir aggregates grow into but also out of a <b>bouncing</b> barrier at larger size...|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} common fire play {{techniques}} are <b>bouncing</b> and streaking. In <b>bouncing,</b> lit fire wands (sometimes called batons; essentially a small torch) are <b>bounced</b> along the skin. This {{may or may}} not involve transfer of burning fuel.|$|R

5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for <b>bounce</b> dives to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E
5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball <b>bounce</b> at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Affleck had {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with actress Gwyneth Paltrow from 1997 to 2000.

Although they first broke up in January 1999, months later, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in <b>Bounce</b> (2000) and they soon resumed their relationship. They separated again in October 2000. In a 2015 interview, Paltrow said she and Affleck remain friends.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, <b>bouncing</b> an oval-shaped ball {{is still}} a {{volatile}} skill. Even top level players will occasionally lose the ball while <b>bouncing</b> it, by accidentally <b>bouncing</b> the ball on its point, only to see it quickly skid away from him or her.|$|R
5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would <b>bounce</b> slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball <b>bounce</b> at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Further showers breathed extra {{life into}} the pitch, and Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep <b>bounce</b> with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times. Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13. Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106/3.|$|E

50|$|The bonus {{screen is}} {{accessed}} {{every time a}} course is completed, it consists of mystery spaces which increase the player's score when <b>bounced</b> on for the player to receive. 40 <b>bounces</b> are allowed on each bonus screen, though this figure can be increased by the player uncovering more from mystery squares during the preceding course. Once all <b>bounces</b> are used {{or all of the}} mystery spaces are <b>bounced</b> on, play moves to the next course. <b>Bouncing</b> on all mystery spaces awards the player 10,000 points as well as an extra life.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} a {{delivery}} is how far down the pitch towards the batsman the ball <b>bounces.</b> It is described as being either short (<b>bouncing</b> closer to the bowler), full (<b>bouncing</b> nearer the batsman), or a good length (an optimal length, somewhere in between).|$|R

In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and <b>bounce</b> around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of droplets falling onto a horizontal soap film. Both static and vertically vibrated soap films are considered. In the static case, a variety of behaviours were observed, including <b>bouncing,</b> crossing and partial coalescence. A quasi-static description of the soap film shape yields a forceâ€“displacement relation that provides excellent agreement with experiment, and allows us to model the film as a nonlinear spring. This approach yields an accurate criterion for the transition between droplet <b>bouncing</b> and crossing. Moreover, it allows us to rationalize the observed constancy of the contact time and scaling for the coefficient of restitution in the <b>bouncing</b> states. On the vibrating film, a variety of <b>bouncing</b> behaviours were observed, including simple and complex periodic states, multi-periodicity and chaos. A simple theoretical model is developed that captures the essential physics of the <b>bouncing</b> process, reproducing all observed <b>bouncing</b> states. The model enables us to rationalize the observed coexistence of multiple periodic <b>bouncing</b> states by considering the dependence of the energy transferred to the droplet on the phase of impact. Quantitative agreement between model and experiment is deduced for simple periodic modes, and qualitative agreement for more complex periodic and chaotic <b>bouncing</b> states. Analytical solutions are deduced in the limit of weak forcing and dissipation, yielding insight into the contact time and periodicity of the <b>bouncing</b> states. 1...|$|R
