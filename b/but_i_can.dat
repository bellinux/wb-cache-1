5|$|For {{the last}} nine months I have kept silence and treated with disdain the charges of disloyalty and {{suggestions}} of treachery made against me in the Press and elsewhere. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep silence no longer, for these charges and suggestion have now been repeated by public men who have not scrupled to use their position to inflame the overstrained feelings of the people.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E

25|$|The private {{language}} {{argument is}} of central importance to {{debates about the}} nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in my head are distinct from the concepts in your head. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Since his {{departure}} from the United States Air Force, Stone has made several public appearances. Honored at the Spike's annual 2016 Guys' Choice Awards, Stone and his friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler accepted the hero award on June 4, 2016 from actor Clint Eastwood, sharing a conversation with him backstage. [...] "People try and ask us what's the coolest things we've done, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> name 100. It's hard to categorize them," [...] Stone said.|$|E
500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] is {{the kind}} of arena anthem that already sounds like it's being belted {{in the middle of a}} sold-out Madison Square Garden. It's a slow and steady build, but once it reaches that Journey-esque chorus ("I don't want to be alone forever, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be... TONIGHT!", there's no going back. Cue the endless {{intercontinental}} shout-outs at the end ("I don't speak German, but I try!" [...] — a cute nod to [...] "Scheiße"), and you've got an instant classic from Artpop.|$|E

500|$|Adam thought Petipa [...] "charming" [...] as both {{dancer and}} actor, {{and that he}} had [...] "rehabilitated" [...] male dancing with his performance. Of Dumilâtre he wrote, [...] "... in spite of her coldness, [...] {{deserved}} the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> think of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [...] seems to bear a strong resemblance to that goddess." ...|$|E

Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: [...] "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And… make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!" ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan has cited [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] {{as one of}} {{his songs}} that means the most to him. In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't even know where to begin, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe.

500|$|His {{answer was}} {{that in many cases}} animals exist with {{intermediate}} structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find out no such case." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was {{generally}} met with positive reviews from music critics. Romanian publication Libertatea praised the refrain of [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] for being optimistic, and described its beats as [...] "explosive". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, expected the track to become a hit, although stating that the lyrics [...] "aren't exactly strong and Viper's solo in the song adds nothing. He has a unique voice but it's not something I can see myself listening to, he isn't a great singer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see how his vocals change the track." [...] German portal Mix1 awarded [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] with seven out of eight stars when reporting about its release.|$|E
500|$|Taborn's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} came in 1994, {{and was released}} by DIW. Craig Taborn Trio, with bassist Jaribu Shahid and drummer Tani Tabbal, featured Taborn playing {{in a range of}} styles on piano and included several of his own compositions. At this stage in his career, his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were: [...] "Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music, I like to swing. I like to work with harmony and melody in my own music, and I like acoustical instruments. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be quite dictatorial about the composed section, and lay down in great detail what everyone is supposed to do and how they should do it." ...|$|E

And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|Huré became supreme {{commander}} of all troops in Morocco in 1931. [...] Upon his appointment the War Minister, André Maginot, warned him that [...] "if {{you have one}} unfortunate engagement, I will hide your losses and I will lie against the evidence; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only do that once. [...] If you have a second reverse I will be obliged to tell the truth, and then all those - like me - who wish for the pacification of Morocco will be swept away, like Ferry after Lang Son". [...] Referring to the fall of Prime Minister Jules Ferry after the disastrous retreat from Lang Son in Vietnam in 1885. [...] On 16 March 1932 {{he was promoted to}} grand-officer of the Legion, having also received promotion to général de division (major-general).|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it.

[...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E
