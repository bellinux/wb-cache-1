40|$|Scanning Laser Epitaxy (SLE) {{is a new}} layer-by-layer {{additive}} manufacturing process being developed in the Direct Digital Manufacturing Laboratory at Georgia Tech. SLE allows for the fabrication of three-dimensional objects with specified microstructure through the controlled melting and re-solidification of a metal powder placed atop a base substrate. This dissertation discusses the work done to date on assessing the feasibility of using SLE to both repair single crystal (SX) turbine airfoils and manufacture functionally graded turbine components. Current processes such as selective laser melting (SLM) {{are not able to}} create structures with defined microstructure and often have issues with warping of underlying layers due to the high temperature gradients present when scanning a high power laser beam. Additionally, other methods of repair and buildup have typically been plagued by crack formation, equiaxed grains, stray grains, and grain multiplication that can occur when dendrite arms are separated from their main dendrites due to remelting. In this work, it is shown that the SLE process is capable of creating fully dense, crack-free equiaxed, directionally-solidified, and SX structures. The SLE process, though, is found to be currently constrained by the cumbersome method of choosing proper parameters and a relative lack of repeatability. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a real-time feedback control scheme based upon a robust offline model will be necessary both to create specified defect-free microstructures and to improve the repeatability of the process enough to allow for multi-layer growth. The proposed control schemes are based upon temperature data feedback provided at high frame rate by a thermal imaging camera. This data is used in both PID and model reference adaptive control (MRAC) schemes and drives the melt pool temperature during processing towards a reference melt pool temperature that has been found to give a desired microstructure in the robust offline model of the process. The real-time control schemes will enable the ground <b>breaking</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the SLE process to create engine-ready net shape turbine components from raw powder material. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Self-Reconfigurable Modular Robots are robotic systems {{consisting}} {{of a number of}} self-contained modules that can autonomously interconnect in different positions and orientations thereby varying the shape and size of the overall modular robot. This ground <b>breaking</b> <b>capability</b> is what in theory, makes self-reconfigurable modular robots more suitable for use in the navigation of unknown or unstructured environments. Here, they are required to reconfigure into different forms so as to optimise their navigation capabilities, a feat that is rendered impossible in conventional specialised robots that lack reconfiguration capabilities. However, the frequent development and use of self-reconfigurable modular robots in everyday robotic navigation applications is significantly hampered by the increased difficulty and overall cost of production of constituent robotic modules. One major contributor to this is the difficulty of designing suitably robust and reliable docking mechanisms between individual robotic modules. Such mechanisms are required to be mechanically stable involving a robust coupling mechanism, and to facilitate reliable inter-module power sharing and communication. This dissertation therefore proposes that the design and development of a functional low cost self-reconfigurable modular robot is indeed achievable by optimising and simplifying the design of a robust and reliable autonomous docking mechanism. In this study, we design and develop such a modular robot, whose constituent robotic modules are fitted with specialised docking connectors that utilise an optimised docking mechanism. This modular robot, its robotic modules and their connectors are then thoroughly tested for accuracy in mobility, electrical and structural stability, inter-module communication and power transfer, self-assembly, self-reconfiguration and self-healing, among others. The outcome of these testing procedures proved that it is indeed possible to optimise the docking mechanisms of self-reconfigurable modular robots, thereby enabling the modular robot to more easily exhibit efficient self-reconfiguration, self-assembly and self-healing behaviours. This study however showed that the type, shape, functionality and structure of electrical contacts used within the docking connectors for inter-module signal transfer and communication {{play a major role in}} enabling efficient self-assembly, self-reconfiguration and self-healing behaviours. Smooth spring loaded metallic electrical contacts incorporated into the docking connector design are recommended. This study also highlights the importance of closed loop control in the locomotion of constituent robotic modules, especially prior to docking. The open loop controlled locomotion optimisations used in this project were not as accurate as was initially expected, making self-assembly rather inaccurate and inconsistent. It is hoped that the outcomes of this research will serve to improve the docking mechanisms of self-reconfigurable modular robots thereby improving their functionality and pave the way for future large scale use of these robots in real world applications...|$|R

Therapeutic strategies designed to edit such mutations will likely depend on the introduction of double-strand breaks and their subsequent repair by homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining. At present, the <b>break</b> repair <b>capabilities</b> of mature neurons, in general, and rod cells, in particular, are undefined. To detect break repair, we generated mice that carry a modified human rhodopsin-GFP fusion gene at the normal mouse rhodopsin locus. The rhodopsin-GFP gene carries tandem copies of exon 2, with an ISceI recognition site situated between them. An ISceI-induced break can be repaired either by non-homologous end joining or by recombination between the duplicated segments, generating a functional rhodopsin-GFP gene. We introduced breaks using recombinant adeno-associated virus to transduce the gene encoding ISceI nuclease. We found that virtually 100 % of transduced rod cells were mutated at the ISceI site, with ∼ 85 % of the genomes altered by end joining and ∼ 15 % by the single-strand annealing pathway of homologous recombination.

40|$|Scanning Laser Epitaxy (SLE) {{is a new}} {{laser-based}} layer-by-layer generative {{manufacturing technology}} being developed in the Direct Digital Manufacturing Laboratory at Georgia Tech. SLE allows creation of geometrically complex three-dimensional components with as-desired microstructure through controlled melting and solidification of stationary metal-alloy powder placed on top of like-chemistry substrates. The proposed research seeks to garner knowledge about the fundamental physics of SLE through simulation-based studies and apply this knowledge for hot section turbine component repair and ultimately extend the process capability to enable one-step manufacture of complex gas turbine components. Prior methods of repair specifically for hot-section Ni-base superalloys have shown limited success, failed to consistently maintain epitaxy in the repaired part and suffered from several mechanical and metallurgical defects. The use of a fine focused laser beam, close thermal control and overlapping raster scan pattern allows SLE to perform significantly better {{on a range of}} so-called “non-weldable” Ni-base superalloys. The process capability is expanded further through closed-loop feedback control of melt pool temperature using an infra-red thermal camera. The process produces dense, crack-free and epitaxial deposit for single-crystal (SX) (CMSX 4), equiaxed (René- 80, IN 100) and directionally solidified (DS) (René- 142) Ni-based superalloys. However, to enable consistent and repeatable production of defect-free parts and future commercial implementation of the technology several concerns related to process capabilities and fundamental physics need to be addressed. To explore the process capability, the fabricated components are characterized in terms of several geometrical, mechanical and metallurgical parameters. An active-contour based image analysis technique has been developed to obtain several microstructural responses from the optical metallography of sample cross-sections and the process goes through continuous improvement through optimization of the process parameters through subsequent design of experiments. The simulation-based study is aimed at developing a multiphysics model that captures the fundamental physics of the fabrication process and allows the generation of constitutive equations for microstructural transitions and properties. For this purpose, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) finite-volume solver is used to model the melting and solidification process. The development work also focuses on studying process response to different superalloy materials and implementing a multivariate statistical process control that allows efficient management and optimization of the design parameter space. In contrast to the prior work on single-bead laser scan, the model incorporates the raster scan pattern in SLE and the temperature dependent local property variations. The model is validated through thermal imaging data. The flow-thermal model is further tied to an empirical microstructural model through the active-contour based optical image analysis technique, which enables the identification of several microstructural transitions for laser beam describing a raster scan pattern. The CFD model can effectively be coupled with finite element solver to assess the stress and deformation and can be coupled with meso-scale models (Cellular Automata) to predict different microstructural evolutions. The research thus allows extending the SLE process to different superalloy materials, performs statistical monitoring of the process, and studies the fundamental physics of the process to enable formulation of constitutive relations for use in closed-loop feedback control; thus imparting ground <b>breaking</b> <b>capability</b> to SLE to fabricate superalloy components with as-desired microstructures.

40|$|Abstract Background Efficient {{and correct}} repair of DNA damage, {{especially}} DNA double-strand breaks, {{is critical for}} cellular survival. Defects in the DNA repair may lead to cell death or genomic instability and development of cancer. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the major repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells. The ability of other repair pathways, such as homologous recombination, to compensate for loss of NHEJ {{and the ways in}} which contributions of different pathways are regulated are far from fully understood. Results In this report we demonstrate that long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends are formed at radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in NHEJ deficient cells. At repair times ≥ 1 h, processing of unrejoined DNA double-strand breaks generated extensive ssDNA at the DNA ends in cells lacking the NHEJ protein complexes DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) or DNA Ligase IV/XRCC 4. The ssDNA formation was cell cycle dependent, since no ssDNA ends were observed in G 1 -synchronized NHEJ deficient cells. Furthermore, in wild type cells irradiated in the presence of DNA-PKcs (catalytic subunit of DNA-PK) inhibitors, or in DNA-PKcs deficient cells complemented with DNA-PKcs mutated in six autophosphorylation sites (ABCDE), no ssDNA was formed. The ssDNA generation also greatly influences DNA double-strand break quantification by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, resulting in overestimation of the DNA double-strand <b>break</b> repair <b>capability</b> in NHEJ deficient cells when standard protocols for preparing naked DNA (i. e., lysis at 50 °C) are used. Conclusion We provide evidence that DNA Ligase IV/XRCC 4 recruitment by DNA-PK to DNA double-strand breaks prevents the formation of long ssDNA ends at double-strand breaks during the S phase, indicating that NHEJ components may downregulate an alternative repair process where ssDNA ends are required. </p...|$|R

With Aquarius and SMOS in orbit with their associated resolution and revisit capability in L-band, further enhancements are of interest. Following studies into desirable resolution and frequency band interests for oceanographic applications (ref: Microwat - an ESA study, see also [URL]), breaking through and desirable requirements have been derived. Investigations into potential antenna architectural realisations have been initiated. Included are radiometer sensor (read:antenna) scenarios, based on conical scanning, interferometric 1 D and pushbroom coverage. A wide coverage {{is available from}} the first two architectures, and a very good sensitivity is available with the pushbroom scenario. There are a couple of interesting aspects, related to polarimetry capabilities, resolution, sensitivity, etc. The pushbroom architecture, at cost of some complexity offers a very good sensitivity with interesting antenna architecture solutions to offer <b>breaking</b> through <b>capabilities,</b> in particular concerning the sensitivity requirements, in combination with polarimetric capabilities. Coverage comes with some infrastructural antenna complexity, with the needs and creativity for a deployable antenna configuration.

Interesting aspects include ongoing technology developments in other related fields with refined results to come would enable to consider antenna architectures are used in which focal plane arrays find a combination with shaped reflector assemblies. With processing capabilities further enhanced - with ongoing developments underway in other sectors as radio astronomers can confirm - one would be able to further improve and refine sensitivity aspects in combination with polarimetric capabilities and resolution enhancement. Instrument sensors (read: antennas) have to be absolutely accurate, where in comparison telecommunication scenarios require a link budget to be fulfilled. The developments and availability of RF front-end and Analogue to Digital circuitry are an important aspect here, enabling the use of focal plane arrays with several hundreds of elements, as already ongoing within the radio-astronomy studies for the square kilometer arrays. Terrestrial applications in low power circuitries are ongoing in various domains, be it for local networks, sensor networks or other (various, IMEC, Fraunhofer, etc.). Further spin-in is expected. One could consider the resulting microwave push-broom antenna architecture in fact as a sensitive multi-frequency microwave camera, operating in frequency bands of interest. We are investigating currently the pushbroom scenario for 2, possibly 3 bands, from C-band up to Ku-band...|$|R
40|$|The North West European shelf-break acts as {{a barrier}} to the {{transport}} and exchange between the open ocean and the shelf seas. The strong spatial variability of these exchange processes is hard to fully explore using observations, and simulations generally are too coarse to simulate the fine-scale processes over the whole region. In this context, under the FASTNEt programme, a new NEMO configuration of the North West European Shelf and Atlantic margin at 1 / 60 ° (∼ 1. 8 km) has been developed, with the objective to better understand and quantify the seasonal and interannual variability of shelf <b>break</b> processes. The <b>capability</b> of this configuration to reproduce the seasonal cycle in SST, the barotropic tide, and fine-resolution temperature profiles is assessed against a basin-scale (1 / 12 °, ∼ 9 km) configuration and a standard regional configuration (7 km resolution). The seasonal cycle is well reproduced in all configurations though the fine-resolution allows the simulation of smaller scale processes. Time-series of temperature at various locations on the shelf show the presence of internal waves with a strong spatio-temporal variability. Spectral analysis of the internal waves reveals peaks at the diurnal, semi-diurnal, inertial and quarter-diurnal bands, which are only realistically reproduced in the new configuration. Tidally induced pycnocline variability is diagnosed in the model and shown to vary with the spring neap cycle with mean displacement amplitudes in excess of 2 m for 30 % of the stratified domain. With sufficiently fine-resolution, internal tides are shown to be generated at numerous bathymetric features resulting in a complex pycnocline displacement superposition pattern...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} radiobiological {{model has}} been developed in this thesis using the Monte Carlo toolkit “Geant 4 ” to produce a radiobiological modelling software package. The result is a simulation capable of: (a) growing a simulated 3 D cell structure (i. e. tumour or mammalian tissue) composed of individual cells (with accurate chemical composition and geometry), (b) irradiating the cells and recording the microdosimetric track structure in each cell, (c) clustering spatially correlated ionisation events into DNA double strand breaks and then (d) predicting the likelihood that any given cell will survive. The novelty of this model {{is its ability to}} predict both the microscopic and macroscopic outcome of radiobiology experiments while varying input parameters such as cell line, radiation type, tumour geometry, dose etc. Previous research in this area has been limited to simple water volumes as representations of cells and none have been combined into an integrated radiobiological model. Model Development Cellular Growth Model The cellular growth model consists of two parts. The first part is a geometrical and chemical description of a single cell. The second is a cellular growth model describing the growth kinetics of a group of cells. When combined, they form a simulated macroscopic cell mass composed of individual microscopic cells. A template was first designed within Geant 4 for a single cell containing properties such as cell size, nucleus dimensions, and cytoplasm composition. Cellular dimensions and composition were obtained from previous publications. The cellular growth model is a mathematical model which attempts to replicate the growth characteristics of either regular or cancerous cells. The code populates a volume of specified dimension and shape with cells of random dimension, rotation and position governed by the characteristics of a given cell line. A general requirement for Geant 4 simulations is a non-overlapping geometry. A custom algorithm was developed in the current work to ensure that the cells in the tumour geometry did not overlap before importing into Geant 4. The time required to “grow” a tumour using this code is proportional to the number of cells in the volume. The time to produce a tumour containing approximately 10 ⁵ cells is typically less than 1 hour. However, the time required to complete the irradiation stage of the code is strongly dependant on the number of cells in the tumour. To produce results in a reasonable amount of time, we were limited to using tumours containing less than 10 ⁴ cells. The position, rotation and size of each tumour were then exported to a file in a format which could be imported by our custom Geant 4 simulation. Cellular Irradiation A method called parameterisation was used inside Geant 4 to combine the single cell structure and the spatial properties of the cells (generated by the cellular growth model) to produce a cellular mass which can be irradiated virtually. To our knowledge, Geant 4 has not been used to simulate particle interactions in such a large number of complex volumes. This achievement {{is the result of the}} efficiency of the unique parameterisation code developed in this thesis. The Geant 4 particle tracking tool kit enables the cells to be irradiated with different types of radiation (such as protons, electrons, photons) and records the positions of the ionisation damage in each cell. For high LET radiation (such as heavy ions), the primary cell damage mechanism is direct ionisation damage. By recording the position and energy deposited in each ionisation event, the probability of a cell surviving or dying can be calculated. The first two stages of the code were tested by predicting and quantifying the radiosensitisation effect of cells by gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles were introduced into the cellular geometries and the frequency of ionisation effects within the cells was measured. It was determined that the radiosensitisation effect of gold nanoparticles is proportional to the concentration of gold within the cell, inversely proportional to the energy of the incident photon and strongly dependant on position within the cell. When the cells were irradiated with 80 kVp x-rays, the damage to the cells was determined to be approximately 10 times that of cells irradiated without gold nanoparticles. When a typical 6 MV linear accelerator x-ray beam was used to irradiate the cells, the damage to the cells was only 1. 2 times higher that measured without gold nanoparticles. These results suggest that the primary dose enhancement effect is the result of the increase in photoelectric cross section caused by the local increase in the effective atomic number within the cell. Ionisation Clustering In order to predict the biological damage to the cells, the ionisation damage calculated in the previous two stages of the code needed to be clustered into DNA strand breakages. To cluster the ionisation events into double strand breaks, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was developed. Ionisation events are clustered into a DSB if the Euclidean distance from the centre of the DSB centroid ("centre of mass" of the cluster) is less than 3. 4 nm (length of 10 base pairs in DNA). A DSB is defined to be “simple” if the cluster contains two ionisation events. A DSB is “complex” if it contains three or more ionisation events. In typical radiotherapy treatments, several grays of radiation dose are delivered. Microscopically, this corresponds to billions or trillions of individual ionisation events. When simulated computationally, this has obvious storage and processing issues. The effects of this problem were minimised by considering only a small volume of cells (< 10 ³ cells). Even with such a small number of cells, the total number of ionisation events to process was in excess of 10 ⁷. In terms of computational time, this section of the code is highly efficient but at the expense of system resources. The large system RAM requirements mean that the code can only be executed on a 64 bit processor in its current form. DNA Repair Model The basis for the DNA repair model in the current work is the two lesion kinetics (TLK) model. In the current work we have expanded on the TLK model and implemented it as a method of describing the repair of the ionisation damages produced in Geant 4. The most notable improvement lies in implementing the model on a cell by cell basis instead of modelling the repair kinetics as an average of all cells in the volume (e. g. a tumour). The DNA repair model was calibrated and tested using experimental data for V 79 Chinese hamster cells irradiated with 0. 76 and 1. 9 MeV proton radiation. Once calibrated, the experimental and calculated values for cell survival were in good agreement (< 7 % difference). Cross Section Verification The validity and accuracy of the Geant 4 cross sectional data was tested by comparing simulated and experimental data. Geant 4 has been shown to be able to simulate radiation interactions of very low energy particles (to approximately ~ 1 eV (debated)). However, our investigation (and previous publications) has shown differences of up to ± 30 % (between simulated and experimental data) in the differential cross section of electrons and protons at energies below 100 eV. Our investigation also revealed a similar discrepancy with other comparable Monte Carlo packages including PARTRAC and RITRACKS. However, within the energy range we have investigated throughout this research, there is good agreement between both experimental data and data predicted by other MC packages. Effect of Indirect Radiation Damages on Cellular Survival To investigate the contribution from indirect damages in our previous studies, a MC software package called RITRACKS was used which is capable of simulating the production yields of free radical species due to the physical interactions of ionising radiation in water. Utilising the clustering algorithm and DNA repair model from our previous Geant 4 investigation, we attempted to quantify the cellular lethality of direct and indirect radiation damages. Our study has shown that for particles with LET ~ 1000 keV/μm (50 MeV/amu ⁵⁶Fe ions, the contribution to DNA damage from indirect damages is still approximately 50 %. Conclusion A comprehensive radiobiological simulation has been developed capable of predicting the complex ionisation track structure of ionising radiation (e. g. photons, protons and carbon ions) through individual cells. Subsequently, predicting the biological outcome within individual cells by tracking the formation and repair of DNA strand <b>breaks.</b> The <b>capabilities</b> of the software have been demonstrated for use in novel radiotherapy treatment techniques.
