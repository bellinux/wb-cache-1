40|$|Due {{to their}} sessile nature, plants {{have to cope}} with and adjust to their {{fluctuating}} environment. Temperature elevation stimulates the growth of Arabidopsis aerial parts. This process is mediated by increased biosynthesis of the growth-promoting hormone auxin. How plant roots respond to elevated ambient temperature is however still elusive. Here we present strong evidence that temperature elevation impinges on <b>brassinosteroid</b> hormone signaling to alter root growth. We show that elevated temperature leads to increased root elongation, independently of auxin or factors known to drive temperature-mediated shoot growth. We further demonstrate that <b>brassinosteroid</b> signaling regulates root responses to elevated ambient temperature. Increased growth temperature specifically impacts on the level of the <b>brassinosteroid</b> receptor BRI 1 to downregulate <b>brassinosteroid</b> signaling and mediate root elongation.

Application of brassinolide and castasterone rescued the dpy phenotype, as did C- 23 -hydroxylated, 6 -deoxo intermediates of brassinolide biosynthesis.

Measurements of endogenous <b>brassinosteroid</b> levels by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were consistent with this hypothesis. To examine brassinosteroid-regulated gene expression in dpy, we performed cDNA subtractive hybridization and isolated a novel xyloglucan endotransglycosylase that is regulated by <b>brassinosteroid</b> treatment.

40|$|The <b>brassinosteroid</b> {{receptor}} <b>BRASSINOSTEROID</b> INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI 1) is {{a member}} of the leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase family. The intracellular kinase domain of BRI 1 is an active kinase and also encapsulates a guanylate cyclase catalytic centre. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of BRI 1 generates pmol amounts of cGMP per μg protein with a preference for magnesium over manganese as a co-factor. Importantly, a functional BRI 1 kinase is essential for optimal cGMP generation. Therefore, the guanylate cyclase activity of BRI 1 is modulated by the kinase while cGMP, the product of the guanylate cyclase, in turn inhibits BRI 1 kinase activity. Furthermore, we show using Arabidopsis root cell cultures that cGMP rapidly potentiates phosphorylation of the downstream substrate <b>BRASSINOSTEROID</b> SIGNALING KINASE 1 (BSK 1). Taken together, our results suggest that cGMP acts as a modulator that enhances downstream signaling while dampening signal generation from the receptor. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} is {{a universal}} mechanism that regulates cellular activities. The <b>brassinosteroid</b> (BR) signal transduction pathway is a relay of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cascades. It starts with the BR-induced activation of the membrane receptor kinase <b>brassinosteroid</b> insensitive 1 (BRI 1), resulting in the dephosphorylation of transcription factors such as BZR 1 /BES 2 and BZR 2 /BES 1 followed by BR-induced gene expression. <b>Brassinosteroid</b> signal transduction research has progressed rapidly by identifying the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation site(s) of the BR-regulated kinase and phosphatase substrates with a simultaneous pursuit of mutant phenotypes. Autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation, and serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor protein kin-ases BRI 1 and BRI 1 -associated kinase (BAK 1) have increased {{the understanding of the}} regulatory role of those kinases during physiological and developmental processes in plants.

50|$|BAK1 is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase {{has been}} {{reported}} to regulate the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1. It is involved in signalling by FLS2 and EFR.

The bak1-mutant plants also show a reduction in early, but not late, EF-Tu-triggered responses. The decrease in responses to PAMPs is not due to reduced sensitivity to <b>brassinosteroids.</b> In vivo FLS2 and BAK1 form a complex, in a specific ligand-dependent manner, within the first minutes of stimulation with flagellin.

50|$|Programmed {{senescence}} {{seems to}} be heavily influenced by plant hormones.

Cytokinins help to maintain the plant cell and expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes late in development prevents leaf senescence. Withdrawal of cytokinin, or if the cell cannot perceive the cytokinin, it may then undergo apoptosis or senescence. In addition, mutants that cannot perceive ethylene show delayed senescence. Genome-wide comparison of mRNAs expressed during dark-induced senescence versus those expressed during age-related developmental senescence demonstrate that jasmonic acid and ethylene are more important for dark-induced (stress-related) senescence while salicylic acid is more important for developmental senescence.|$|E
