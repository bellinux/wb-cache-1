50|$|The {{blacksmith}} lapwing or <b>blacksmith</b> <b>plover</b> (Vanellus armatus) occurs commonly from Kenya through central Tanzania {{to southern}} and southwestern Africa. The vernacular name {{derives from the}} repeated metallic 'tink, tink, tink' alarm call, which suggests a blacksmith's hammer striking an anvil.|$|E
40|$|Prey {{manipulation}} {{was investigated}} {{as a means}} of reducing the bird hazard at the Bloemfontein airport, central South Africa. From January 1985 to December 2005 approximately 7, 000 individuals representing 55 bird species which, potentially, posed a threat to aviation, were collected at the airport. Numerically the crowned plover (Vanellus coronatus), <b>blacksmith</b> <b>plover</b> (V. armatus), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), white-winged korhaan (Eupodotis afraoides) and double-banded courser (Smutsornis africanus) in order of importance constituted more than 90 % of the total sample. Based on stomach analyses harvester termites (Hodotermes mossambicus) comprise the dominant food source of all five species concerned. Experimentally a significant and sustainable decrease in termite numbers and activities in disturbed grass areas could be accomplished by administering bait treated with Gaucho, a systemic insecticide. By using a combination of pitfall traps, mouse traps and sweep nets over a period of 15 months, prey abundance in undisturbed long grass (average 57 cm) and grass which were kept permanently short (average 22 cm) by regular mowing was compared. Terrestrial invertebrates, mainly insects, contributed more than 90 % of the overall sample with twice as many individuals in short grass than in long grass. The available food source for the predominantly insectivorous avifauna at the Bloemfontein airport can thus be effectively reduced by implementing a so-called long grass policy in combination with seasonal chemical control of harvester termites, thereby limiting bird numbers and also bird strikes...|$|E
25|$|The Wetlands {{is a large}} aviary {{alongside}} Tsavo and is home to {{a variety}} of Storks, Cranes and waterfowl. In 2009, a walk-through bird safari with African bird species opened. It currently houses von der decken's hornbills, lilac-breasted rollers, hamerkops, weaver birds, <b>Blacksmith</b> <b>Plovers,</b> Red-Winged Starlings and a variety of waterfowl, amongst other species. At {{the other side of the}} Bird Safari is a Large pen for wattled cranes and Black crowned cranes.|$|R
40|$|Bloemfontein airport, {{situated}} in the central Free State, experiences {{the greatest number of}} bird-aircraft collisions at South African airports, relative to its (low) air traffic. In an attempt to rectify the situation, aspects of the feeding ecology of birds presenting a potential hazard at the airport were investigated. Plant surveys indicated that the study area can be classified as a dry Cymbopogon – Themeda veld type in a relatively good condition. Using 270 pitfall traps over a continuous period of 15 months, it was established that {{more than twice as many}} ground-living invertebrates, mainly insects, occurred in grass kept permanently short (average height 22 cm) compared to those in undisturbed long grass (average height 57 cm). Based on 4, 843 birds from 51 species posing a threat to aviation and which were shot as part of an ongoing management program extending over 11 years, medium-sized, ground-living birds such as crowned <b>plovers</b> (Vanellus coronatus), <b>blacksmith</b> <b>plovers</b> (V. armatus), whitewinged korhaans (Eupodotis afraoides), double-banded coursers (Smutsornis africanus), spotted dikkops (Burhinus capensis), cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), Swainson’s francolins (Francolinus swainsonii) and Orange River francolins (F. levaillantoides) dominated the local bird population. Crop and/or stomach analyses of these birds indicate that insects, mainly Isoptera but also Coleoptera and Orthoptera, collectively constitute their main food source. The Isoptera, more specifically the harvester termite (Hodotermes mossambicus), is, moreover, the only important prey taxon showing a conspicuous utilization peak during the relative food shortage of the dry season. A significant and sustained decrease in harvester termite numbers and activities was accomplished by administering Gaucho-treated bait in disturbed grass areas, thereby reducing the availability of food and, hopefully, also bird numbers and bird-aircraft collisions. Implementation of a so-called long grass policy as a control strategy should have a similar effect...|$|R
