40|$|A <b>burst</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{remaining}} in a reactor may eventually release such quantities of radioactive fission products into the coolant circuit as {{to cause a}} potential health hazard or maintenance difficulty. It is important, therefore, {{to be able to}} detect and locate a burst so that the reactor operator can discharge the cartridge concerned. Of all the possible methods, only detection by the released fission products is satisfactory. Gaseous fission products diffuse through the leak in the can wall against a coolant inflow induced by oxidation of the fuel, and their presence in the coolant has to be detected against an unavoidable background count. The leak size at the threshold of detection can be estimated from the operating conditions, {{and the manner in which}} b. c. d. (<b>burst</b> <b>cartridge</b> detection) signals arise from a developing burst merits special study. To discriminate against the radioactive decay of the coolant gas itself the precipitation system of monitoring is used. From each fuel channel in the reactor a sample of gas is drawn periodically. This is passed through a precipitation chamber where particular fission product nuclides decay to give ionized daughter products which are collected on a charged wire. The wire is moved to a shielded scintillation counter and the fission product nuclides, which undergo a second radioactive transition, are measured to the exclusion of the active nuclides in the coolant which do not. The performance and sensitivity of the system can be calculated and optimized by considering the expression for the count from the wire. The mechanical design of the equipment varies in detail from station to station. In later designs the mechanical equipment is simpler and easier to maintain, and greater use is being made of automatic processing and presentation of the signal...|$|E
60|$|They {{had also}} rifles not a few, and cartridges, which they {{hid in the}} roof. The women wept very greatly when we burned such houses, {{but they did not}} {{approach}} too near after the flames had taken good hold of the thatch, for fear of the <b>bursting</b> <b>cartridges.</b> The women of the Boer-log are very clever. They are more clever than the men. The Boer-log are clever? Never, never, no! It is the Sahibs who are fools. For their own honour's sake the Sahibs must say that the Boer-log are clever; but it is the Sahibs' wonderful folly that has made the Boer-log. The Sahibs should have sent us into the game.|$|R
5000|$|The Imperial Japanese Army {{introduced}} the Type 30 rifle in 1897. However, the weapon had numerous shortcomings, which were highlighted by combat {{experience in the}} early stages of the Russo-Japanese War. These included <b>bursting</b> <b>cartridges,</b> a poorly designed lock in which excess gunpowder tended to accumulate, burning the face of the shooter, frequent misfires, jamming, difficulty in cleaning, and cartridge extraction. Major Kijiro Nambu undertook a redesign of the Type 30 rifle, which was introduced in 1906. Nambu reduced the number of parts making up the Type 30's bolt from nine to six and at that same time simplified manufacture and disassembly of the bolt without the need of tools. A dust cover was added because of experiences in the Russo-Japanese War that left rifles inoperable from dust. The weapon was produced in several locations: ...|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "rapid firing" [...] {{firearms}} {{were usually}} {{similar to the}} 19th century Gatling gun, which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as {{and as long as}} the operator turned a crank. Eventually, the [...] "rapid" [...] firing mechanism was perfected and miniaturized to the extent that either the recoil of the firearm or the gas pressure from firing could be used to operate it, thus the operator needed only to pull a trigger (which made the firing mechanisms truly [...] "automatic"). An automatic (or [...] "fully automatic") firearm is one that automatically re-cocks, reloads, and fires as long as the trigger is depressed. An automatic firearm is capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The Gatling gun may have been the first automatic weapon, though the modern trigger-actuated machine gun was not widely introduced until the First World War with the German [...] "Spandau" [...] and British Lewis Gun. Automatic rifles such as the Browning Automatic Rifle were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired handgun rounds, known as submachine guns, also appeared in this time. Many modern military firearms have a selective fire option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the firearm be fired either in the semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. In the current M16A2 and M16A4 variants of the U.S.-made M16, continuous fully automatic fire is not possible, having been replaced by an automatic <b>burst</b> of three <b>cartridges</b> (this conserves ammunition and increases controllability). Automatic weapons are largely restricted to military and paramilitary organizations, though many automatic designs are infamous for their use by civilians.|$|R
