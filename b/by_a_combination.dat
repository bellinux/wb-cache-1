5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine. A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E

5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of genetic and {{environmental}} factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E

5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} caused <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder.

On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E
