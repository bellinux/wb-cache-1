Grange Farm in Kesgrave in the outskirts of Ipswich is <b>built</b> <b>round</b> a network spine of cycle and footpaths. The Maidenhall area of Ipswich is also <b>built</b> <b>round</b> a central spine of footpaths. Kesgrave High School is accessible from the network via a pedestrian subway under the main road.|$|R

50|$|The rope-worked tunnel {{proved a}} major handicap, {{and after the}} company had {{been taken over by}} the North British Railway, a longer but more {{convenient}} route was <b>built</b> <b>round</b> {{the eastern edge of the}} city at Abbeyhill. It opened in 1868.|$|R
5000|$|The bus-driver Bob Scobie fancies Irene {{but seldom}} says {{anything}} but 'Eh?' and 'Aye' (that is, 'yes') and his entire part is <b>built</b> <b>round</b> {{responding to the}} comments and questions of others with {{one or both of}} these two monosyllables.|$|R
50|$|The name of {{the village}} itself commemorates one Gwollu (or Gbollu) Koro Limann, who had a double {{circular}} wall <b>built</b> <b>round</b> the local community in the 19th century as a defence against Babatu's raids. A preserved section of the mud wall can still be seen.|$|R

5000|$|The {{community}} {{was named for}} the sandy character of the soil in the area. It {{is the site of}} the Round Methodist Church on the National Register, <b>built</b> <b>round</b> by the Poling family [...] "so the devil would have no place to hide."It's post office is now closed.|$|R
40|$|Circulus Maximus is an {{installation}} in the <b>round</b> <b>space</b> {{on the ground}} floor of the Antwerp museum of contemporary art (MuHKA). Its spatial structure questions the identity of this compelling exhibition space. The intervention consisted in inserting a diagonal disc - diagonal in the sense that connected an upper and lower opposing point of the cylindrical space - that provided a sloping floor, that simultaneously nearly touches the floor and the sealing of the <b>round</b> <b>space.</b> The disc was covered with a soft beige carpet that matches the existing colour of the wall and ceiling of the exhibition space. As a materialisation of the largest possible circular surface within the space, Circulus Maximus substantiates a poetic measure of the space. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{greater part}} of Gleaston, the villages of Leece and Dendron, are {{included}} in the parochial parish of St. Matthew Dendron. The ancient village of Leece is <b>built</b> <b>round</b> a tarn and appears twice in the Domesday Book. Lies was listed in the Manor of Hougun held by Earl Tostig.|$|R

The second, {{much larger than}} the first, but of the same form, was <b>built</b> <b>round</b> the other, in which service was held to the last, when it was {{literally}} thrown out of the windows of its successor. The last edifice disappeared about forty years since.--EDITOR.] ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{little time}} being lost in seeking our own equipage, {{we reached the}} hotel perhaps about ten minutes after these strangers. It was an hotel in the foreign sense: a {{collection}} of dwelling-houses, not an inn--a vast, lofty pile, with a huge arch to its street-door, leading through a vaulted covered way, into a square all <b>built</b> <b>round.</b>|$|R
60|$|Thus they drifted on {{till the}} old city of Avignon rose on {{the eyes of the}} travellers, a dark pile of {{buildings}} where the massive houses, <b>built</b> <b>round</b> courts, with few external windows, recalled that these had once been the palaces of cardinals accustomed to the Italian city feuds, which made every house become a fortress.|$|R
50|$|Great Fulford House lies to {{the west}} of Dunsford; a Domesday manor which has been the home of the Fulford family since at least 1190. The present house was mainly built in the early 16th century and is a semi-fortified mansion house <b>built</b> <b>round</b> a central courtyard. It was the {{backdrop}} to the 2014 reality-television programme, Life Is Toff.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} <b>built</b> <b>round</b> a {{rectangle}} of streets, {{with the church}} in the south corner, and the green, with most of the older houses near it, on the northwest side. The southern part of the village has been developed extensively since 1920. The village green is a large uninclosed stretch of grass, with a stream running through it.|$|R
50|$|The marsh {{was turned}} into {{productive}} farm land in past centuries. The land of Walland Marsh was reclaimed mostly from the 13th to 15th century, later than that of Romney Marsh to the north-east. The reclamation was done in stages by creating innings: an embankment was <b>built</b> <b>round</b> an area of marsh, which would drain at low tide.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} maps all {{the exhibitions}} that ever {{took place in}} the <b>round</b> <b>space</b> {{on the ground floor of}} the M HKA since its opening in 1993 until 2015. The publication is part of Spatium Vacuum, a project that exhibits the <b>round</b> exhibition <b>space.</b> By means of isolating this iconic cylindrical room from the rest of the museum and making it directly accessible from the street it temporarily becomes an artefact in public space. During 24 hours one can freely walk in and out. The space is left empty. Before entering it one can pick up a free copy. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} two architectural firms working in conjunction: by DP Architects (DPA) of Singapore and the London-based Michael Wilford & Partners (MWP), although the latter left the project in May 1995. The design consists of two <b>rounded</b> <b>space</b> frames fitted with triangulated glass elements and sunshades, which balance outward views with solar shading.|$|R

And {{it was a large}} well, <b>built</b> <b>round</b> a rock, with room for many people; and the sultan entered, and the judges and the rich men {{followed}} him. And when he saw the gazelle lying there he wept afresh, and took it in his arms and carried it away.|$|R

A fourth floor, known as Top Deck, was converted from retail units in 2007 into a 10-screen cinema by Vue with Europe's first digital screen.|$|R

Sharan Newman commented, [...] "The idea of building a church in the form of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem wasn't new. A hundred years before the Templar order was founded, the Benedictine church at Saint-BÃ©nigne at Dijon was <b>built</b> with a <b>round</b> nave in imitation of the Holy Sepulcher. Even the Hospitallers <b>built</b> <b>round</b> churches." ...|$|R
