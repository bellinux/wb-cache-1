500|$|To be {{registered}} as a Finnhorse, a horse must either have parents registered as Finnhorses, or be verified to be descended {{from at least}} three generations of Finnhorses. To qualify for the Finnhorse stud book as a <b>breeding</b> <b>animal,</b> a horse must prove itself by meeting or exceeding the breed standard set for various qualities: performance ability, conformation, disposition, and in some cases, quality of offspring. Any horse offered for the Finnhorse studbook {{must be at least}} 4 years old, a stallion or a mare, and registered a Finnhorse. The stud book evaluation board considers the performance of horses in their desired discipline: riding, driving, harness racing, or workhorse events. Horses to {{be registered}} in the stud book are tested for performance at the stud book registration inspection. With the exception of the trotter section, they are also evaluated on [...] "type"; the suitability of the horse's overall build for the section for which it is offered. Individuals that do not qualify for the studbook on their own merits during the stud book evaluation process may be accepted later, based on the quality and accomplishments of their offspring. For this to occur, a horse's offspring are evaluated by their competitive history or their stud book evaluation, and if of high enough quality, their parent then is also granted acceptance into the stud book. Conversely, a horse may be removed from the studbook if its offspring are found to have any inherited flaw or condition. A stallion may also be removed if his offspring are clearly below the average level in competitive success or stud book evaluations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Accounting for and {{quantifying}} the associative {{effect of}} each animal could improve both {{welfare of animals}} and response to selection. Because of the limitation of REML, Gibbs Sampling could be an alternative technique to estimate the variance component of the associative effect. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the estimation accuracy of the variance component of associative effect by using simulation via Gibbs Sampling. The simulated data comprised five generations of pigs. The <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> of each generation were selected randomly. In the simulation, variations were introduced for the methods of assigning pens (random, mixed sib and full sib), the number of pigs per pen (5 or 10), the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> per generation (162 or 324) and the correlation between genetic direct effect and genetic associative effect (- 0. 5, 0. 1 or + 0. 5). Each set of simulation was run for 30 replications. Results Random assignment or mixed sib assignment resulted in bias of estimated variance components in only 3 of 24 combinations. Furthermore, these 3 cases occurred with 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> With full sib assignment, 9 out of 12 groups of estimates significantly deviated from the true parameter value. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with the full sib assignment were higher than with the other two methods of pen assignment in most of the cases. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with datasets with 324 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> were notably smaller than the datasets from 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> Within each method of pen assignment, the relative bias of the associative effect was significantly smaller with group size 10 than with group size 5. Conclusion Full sib assignment caused difficulties to estimate variance components in most of the cases, due to a lack of identifiability. With random and mixed assignment, most data structures yielded unbiased results but increasing the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> or group size improves the estimation. Thus to get identifiable and unbiased estimates of the genetic associative effect, it is recommended to avoid close genetic relationship between animals within one pen and to use sufficient numbers of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> and sufficient group sizes. </p...|$|R
