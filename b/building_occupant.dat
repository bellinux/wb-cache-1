40|$|As Hong Kong {{is famous}} for its image of leading {{international}} financial metropolis, many high-rise office buildings are confined inside some developed commercial districts of Hong Kong. A place for provision of greenery in such districts seems impracticable. However, greenery can exist in forms of green roof onto office buildings, it seems a practical way to embellish this concrete city. Academic studies from other countries have proven that having green roof onto buildings is able to bring numerous psychological benefits to the <b>building</b> <b>occupants,</b> but is this fact still true for office <b>building</b> <b>occupants</b> of Hong Kong? Besides, what do office <b>building</b> <b>occupants</b> think about the presence of green roof onto the building they are working inside? In this study we would like to explore the perceptions of office <b>building</b> <b>occupants</b> in Hong Kong toward green roof, as well as their mode of green roof usage in case green roof is present. The opinions on how office <b>building</b> <b>occupants</b> get satisfied with the green roof they have visited during their working time may give us a glance to the direction of green roof development in the future. What they expect on green roof is the best source of evidence in designing an optimal green roof on human-based consideration. Study result features that green roof on office building can provide a decent leisure place to occupants for relaxation, although they seem do not treat green roof as a vital place where they must go. Office <b>building</b> <b>occupants</b> are generally satisfied with green roof having appropriate provisions such as large variety of vegetation, attractive appearance and good management level. Some crucial characteristics of green roof have been identified in the viewpoints of office <b>building</b> <b>occupants</b> such as its aesthetic nature and location for convenient access. In considering the numerous benefits of green roof, every visitor, as office <b>building</b> <b>occupants,</b> agrees that green roof should be present for their needs.

40|$|Physics based {{collapse}} {{simulations of}} moment resisting steel framed buildings are presented. Survival {{probability of a}} <b>building</b> <b>occupant</b> is proposed as a single scalar measure to quantify resistance to progressive collapse of a particular structure at hand. Practical procedure for the survival probability calculations by means of physics based simulations and theorem of total probability {{is shown in the}} paper. Simulations of structural response to the sudden removal of a key structural member have been carried out for a number of failure scenarios. Such analysis is at the forefront of civil engineering modeling because it involves material nonlinearities, large deflections, finite strains, and certainly requires dynamic analysis. Saving human lives in the case of abnormal loadings and/or unexpected hazards is equivalent to minimizing the area of collapsed floors. Such approach should also minimize the financial loss to a building owner. The area of collapsed floors can be extracted from the physics based simulations. It is proposed to quantify the goodness of design with the survival probability of a <b>building</b> <b>occupant.</b> Such single scalar measure provides an opportunity to employ optimization algorithms to produce the safest and the most economic structural design. © 2009 ASCE...|$|E

40|$|Facade {{parameters}} {{influence the}} energy flows {{coming through the}} facade, in order to optimize the indoor environment for {{the comfort of the}} individual <b>building</b> <b>occupant</b> with minimal energy use. How can the facade make optimal use of the free incoming energy flows to maximize the comfort level of the individual <b>building</b> <b>occupant</b> at minimal energy use? The type of façade described as a second skin façade is characterised by a single glass layer on the outside and an isolated façade layer on the inside, which often includes an insulated glass layer. The application of the single glass layer as a second skin around the insulated layer results in an air cavity between these two layers. The property that distinguishes a second skin façade from other DSF is that it relies on natural ventilation of the cavity, in comparison to other facades which use mechanical systems to induce the airflow. The advantage of merely using natural ventilation in the façade cavity is the lower energy consumption. However, it also results in some unresolved issues which require further attention. This project is concerned with the behaviour of a highly complex shaped second skin facade on a Dutch office building, and the thermal comfort impact on the building user. During 3 weeks different measurements were done to determine the main characteristics of the glass and the facade. These measurements were related to earlier measurements done by other buildings with a second skin facade. A key difference between a second skin facade, as well as other climate facades, and more traditional opaque facades is its dynamic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Decommissioning Technical Basis Document (DTBD) is to {{establish}} the average nuclide fraction for structures and to derive the resulting structure DCGL. In addition, the use of surrogates is also discussed. 2. 0 DISCUSSION Individual nuclide DCGLs were previously derived for structures in DTBD 04 - 004 based on the <b>building</b> <b>occupant</b> dose model. This DTBD employs site sample data to determine the nuclides present in structural materials {{as well as the}} relative amounts of the nuclides, including the hard-to-detect nuclides. The sample data are then subjected to the " 10 percent rule " in order to remove those nuclides contributing less than {{a small fraction of the}} dose to the <b>building</b> <b>occupant.</b> In addition, the individual nuclide fractions are averaged to derive the structure DCGL for the site. Finally, the adjusted data are then analyzed to derive the specific dose for each sample and for all of the samples combined to ensure the DCGL is less than 25 mrem. Surrogate DCGLs are also calculated using both Cs- 137 and, where appropriate, Co- 60. 3. 0 DEFINITIONS Surrogate DCGL A derived concentration guideline value for one or more hard to detect nuclides based on the relationship to an easily detected radionuclide. If there is an established ratio among concentrations of n nuclides in a survey unit or site nuclide mix the concentration of every nuclide can be expressed in terms of any one of them.
