[...] "Try {{to understand that this}} is merely common malaria; I've had it several times, and it seldom <b>bothers</b> <b>you</b> much when you're out of the tropics. Why, Bertram--you've seen my cousin--was down with it a week at Sandymere; temperature very high, old fool of a family doctor looking serious and fussing.

Are you aware that the master of a ship has charge of all the cash in hand, pays the men advances, receives freight and passage-money, and runs up bills in every port? All this he does as the owner's confidential agent, and his integrity is proved by his receipted bills. I tell you, the captain of a ship {{is more likely to}} forget his pants than these bills which guarantee his character. I've known men drown to save them--bad men, too; but this is the shipmaster's honour. And here this Captain Trent--not hurried, not threatened with anything but a free passage in a British man-of-war--has left them all behind. I don't want to express myself too strongly, because the facts appear against me, but the thing is impossible." ...|$|E

6000|$|After puberty, a {{child may}} as well be told the simple and {{necessary}} facts of sex. As things stand, the parent may as well do it. But briefly, coldly, and with as cold a dismissal as possible.--"Look here, you're not a child any more; you know it, don't you? You're going to be a man. And you know what that means. It means you're going to marry a woman later on, and get children. You know it, and I know it. But in the meantime, leave yourself alone. I know you'll have a lot of bother with yourself, and your feelings. I know what is happening to you. And I know you get excited about it. But you needn't. Other men have all gone through it. So don't you go creeping off by yourself and doing things on the sly. It won't do you any good.--I know what you'll do, because we've all been through it. I know the thing will keep coming on you at night. But remember that I know. Remember. And remember that I want you to leave yourself alone. I know what it is, I tell you. I've been through it all myself. You've got to go through these years, before you find a woman you want to marry, and whom you can marry. I went through them myself, and got myself worked up a good deal more than was good for me.--Try to contain yourself. Always try to contain yourself, and be a man. That's the only thing. Always try and be manly, and quiet in yourself. Remember I know what it is. I've been the same, in the same state that you are in. And probably I've behaved more foolishly and perniciously than ever you will. So come to me if anything really <b>bothers</b> <b>you.</b> And don't feel sly and secret. I do know just what you've got and what you haven't. I've been as bad and perhaps worse than you. And the only thing I want of you is to be manly. Try and be manly, and quiet in yourself." ...|$|E
