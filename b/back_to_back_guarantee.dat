40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> can {{be defined}} as a rule of {{construction}} by which in appropriate circumstances the wording of the reinsurance agreement is to be construed {{in the same way as}} the wording of the underlying policy. The discussion on whether or not two contracts are <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> is always interconnected with the contract wording. That way, the most suitable way <b>to</b> discuss the <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> principle is <b>to</b> discuss firstly the full reinsurance clause, incorporation, and then <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> principle conditions, scope, and limits. <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> overlaps incorporation. If two contracts are rendered <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back,</b> one contract incorporates terms of other one, and the incorporated terms in the reinsurance contract will hold the same meaning as in the underlying policy. Some clauses that can have their meaning altered by <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> presumption are follow the settlements, follow the fortunes, claims control and claims cooperation...|$|R

40|$|LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{steel beam}} {{produced}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills (OATM). The new beam is effectively a channel section with two rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web, and is manufactured using patented dual electric resistance welding and automated roll-forming technologies. OATM is promoting the use of LSBs as flexural members in residential construction. When LSBs are used as <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> built-up sections, {{they are likely to}} improve their moment capacity. However, the research project conducted on the flexural behaviour of <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> built-up LSBs showed that the detrimental effects of lateral distortional buckling in single LSB members appear <b>to</b> remain with <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> built-up LSB members. The ultimate moment capacity of <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> LSB member is also affected by lateral distortional buckling failure. Therefore an investigation was conducted with an aim to develop suitable strength improvement methods, which are likely to mitigate lateral distortional buckling effects and hence improve the flexural strengths of <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> LSB members. This paper presents the details of this investigation, the results and recommendations for the most suitable and cost-effective method, which significantly improves the moment capacities of <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>back</b> LSB members...|$|R
