5|$|In July 551, {{the eastern}} Mediterranean was rocked by the 551 Beirut earthquake, which {{triggered}} a tsunami. The combined fatalities of both events probably exceeded 30,000, with tremors <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> from Antioch to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, {{the field of}} mathematics—specifically algebra—underwent a {{profound}} revolution, whose reverberations are still <b>being</b> <b>felt.</b> Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, {{as well as on}} the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846 by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Florida, {{three people}} were killed in {{relation}} to the storm and no more than $10million in damage occurred, with more than half of which was attributed to agricultural losses. In addition, 76people were injured, 12of whom required hospitalization. Structural damage was relatively limited, with only 63homes and businesses, mostly trailers, being destroyed; 159other structures sustained major damage while a further 631experienced minor damage. The majority of damage from Isbell was not from the hurricane itself but rather tornadoes spawned by its outer bands. At least nine, and as many as twelve, tornadoes affected the state with the greatest effects <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> in the Miami metropolitan area. All storm-related injuries were attributed to these tornadoes as well as the majority of structural damage. According to the National Climatic Data Center, four of these tornadoes were of F2 intensity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} these {{guidelines}} are still <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> through the biotechnology industry and {{the participation of the}} general public in scientific discourse. Due to potential safety hazards, scientists worldwide had halted experiments using recombinant DNA technology, which entailed combining DNAs from different organisms. After the establishment of the guidelines during the conference, scientists continued with their research, which increased fundamental knowledge about biology and the public’s interest in biomedical research.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} themes of the play is the effect social change has on people. The {{emancipation}} of the serfs on 19 February 1861 by Alexander II allowed former serfs to gain wealth and status while some aristocrats were becoming impoverished, unable to tend their estates without the cheap labor of slavery. The effect of these reforms was still <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> when Chekhov was writing forty years after the mass emancipation.|$|E

40|$|Cottonwood in Cotton Candy was {{an artistic}} {{expression}} which utilized experimental textile design by having incorporated sustainable found fibers. This piece {{was intended to}} be displayed as a hands-on, dual-sided table cover. This research combined poplar seed hair fibers (cottonwood) with wool fibers, which were felted to silk chiffon. The color scheme and aesthetic was inspired by cotton candy. Cotton candy shares the open, light and airy essence of cottonwood seed hair fibers. The cottonwood fibers were washed and carded. In addition, the silk illustrates decorative fabric manipulation methods which included fold and clamp dye resist techniques, dye discharge, and felting. It was discovered that cottonwood seed fiber hairs accepted dye when manually manipulated, and lent themselves to <b>being</b> <b>felted</b> when mixed with wool roving. The objective of this design research was to demonstrate the ability of cottonwood seed hair fibers to be incorporated into an artistic textile creation...|$|R
60|$|What we {{have said}} of {{empirical}} generalizations from times past to times still to come, holds equally true of similar generalizations from present times to times past; when persons whose acquaintance with moral and social facts is confined to their own age, take {{the men and the}} things of that age for the type of men and things in general, and apply without scruple to the interpretation of the events of history, the empirical laws which represent sufficiently for daily guidance the common phenomena of human nature at that time and in that particular state of society. If examples are wanted, almost every historical work, until a very recent period, abounded in them. The same may be said of those who generalize empirically from the people of their own country to the people of other countries, as if human <b>beings</b> <b>felt,</b> judged, and acted everywhere in the same manner.|$|R

Also on the board are Tory MPs Virginia Bottomley and Richard Shepherd, as well as Lord Saatchi and Lady Howe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the dark}} habitat, {{certain types of}} {{displays}} are reduced in cavefish, but in other cases they have become stronger, shifting from displays that are aimed at being seen to displays aimed at <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> via water movement. For example, during the courtship of the cave form of the Mexican tetra the pair produce turbulence through exaggerated gill and mouth movements, allowing them to detect each other. Breeding behaviors among cavefish vary extensively, and there are both species that are egg-layers and ovoviparous species that give birth to live young. Uniquely among fish, the genus Amblyopsis brood their eggs in the gill chambers (somewhat like mouthbrooders).|$|E

5000|$|In botany, {{as opposed}} to mycology, [...] "felted" [...] seldom refers to {{internal}} tissues, but rather to furriness {{on the outside of}} leaves or stems. The function of the covering is always protective, sometimes against grazing or browsing animals, sometimes against wind or windblown sand, sometimes against intense sunshine or ultraviolet, and sometimes against drought and desiccation. Two illustrative examples are: Oldenburgia grandis, and Senecio haworthii. The former is a tree that grows in moderately harsh circumstances, but with a reasonable amount of seasonal rain. Its leaves are large, being broad and typically about 30 cm long. While growing to their full size they are vulnerable, so it is quite plausible that <b>being</b> <b>felted</b> protects them from browsers, ultraviolet, drought, and heat. Once their tissues have hardened and become rich in fibre and tannins, they can afford to lose their felt. In this respect they resemble many other plants whose leaves pass through vulnerable phases as they mature, though not all strategies are based on felt.|$|R
25|$|Soon after, he is {{reported}} to have healed a sick woman by laying his hands on her. Dozens of apparent miracles were subsequently performed by Kimbangu, and he gained followers from surrounding villages and towns. The official Catholic organizations protested to the authorities, and the Protestant church abandoned him. The economic effects of Kimbangu's ministry were <b>being</b> <b>felt,</b> with thousands of Congolese leaving their work to listen to Kimbangu speak. In June the Belgians arrested him for inciting revolution and civil disobedience. Four months later he was sentenced to death. After an international outcry, Albert I of Belgium commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. He died 30 years later in prison, in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Funk is a {{major element}} of certain artists {{identified}} with the jam band scene of the late 1990s and 2000s. Phish began playing funkier jams in their sets around 1996, and 1998's The Story of the Ghost was heavily influenced by funk. Medeski Martin & Wood, Robert Randolph & the Family Band, Galactic, Widespread Panic, Jam Underground, Diazpora, Soulive, and Karl Denson's Tiny Universe all drawing heavily from the funk tradition. Lettuce, a band of Berklee College Of Music graduates, was formed in the late 1990s as a pure-funk emergence was <b>being</b> <b>felt</b> through the jam band scene. Many members of the band including keyboardist Neal Evans went on to other projects such as Soulive or the Sam Kininger Band. Dumpstaphunk builds upon the New Orleans tradition of funk, with their gritty, low-ended grooves and soulful four-part vocals. Formed in 2003 to perform at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, the band features keyboardist Ivan Neville and guitarist Ian Neville of the famous Neville family, with two bass players and female funk drummer Nikki Glaspie (formerly of Beyoncé Knowles's world touring band, {{as well as the}} Sam Kininger Band), who joined the group in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Coal mining in India has a {{long history}} of {{commercial}} exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was <b>being</b> <b>felt.</b> Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.|$|E
