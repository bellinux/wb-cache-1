50|$|The <b>blessed</b> milk <b>thistle,</b> Silybum marianum, is a {{plant in}} which another type of venal {{variegation}} occurs, {{but in this case}} it is due to a blister variegation occurring along the veins.|$|R
50|$|Silybum marianum {{has other}} common names include cardus marianus, milk <b>thistle,</b> <b>blessed</b> milkthistle, Marian <b>thistle,</b> Mary thistle, Saint Mary's thistle, Mediterranean milk thistle, {{variegated}} thistle and Scotch thistle. This species is an annual or biennial plant of the Asteraceae family. This fairly typical thistle has red to purple flowers and shiny pale green leaves with white veins. Originally {{a native of}} Southern Europe through to Asia, it is now found throughout the world.|$|R

50|$|As namesake {{member of}} the {{subtribe}} Centaureinae of tribe Cynareae, the knapweeds are probably most closely related to genera such as Carthamus (distaff thistles), Cnicus (<b>blessed</b> <b>thistle),</b> Crupina (crupinas) or Notobasis (Syrian thistle), and somewhat less closely to most other thistles. The monotypic Cnicus seems in fact to properly belong in Centaurea.|$|E
5000|$|Cnicus benedictus (St. Benedict's thistle, <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle,</b> holy thistle or spotted thistle), is a thistle-like {{plant in}} the family Asteraceae, native to the Mediterranean region, from Portugal north to {{southern}} France and east to Iran. It is known {{in other parts of}} the world, including parts of North America, as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Cnicus. Largely reclassified to Cirsium, Carduus, Centaurea ...|$|E
5000|$|Alpha-amanitin: For 6-12 hours, {{there are}} no symptoms. This is {{followed}} by a period of gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and profuse, watery diarrhea). This stage is caused primarily by the phallotoxins and typically lasts 24 hours. At the end of this second stage is when severe liver damage begins. The damage may continue for another 2-3 days. Kidney damage can also occur. Some patients will require a liver transplant. Amatoxins are found in some mushrooms in the genus Amanita, but are also found in some species of Galerina and Lepiota. Overall, mortality is between 10 and 15 percent. Recently, Silybum marianum or <b>blessed</b> milk <b>thistle</b> has been shown to protect the liver from amanita toxins and promote regrowth of damaged cells.|$|R
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the <b>blessed</b> milk <b>thistle</b> (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|R
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the <b>blessed</b> milk <b>thistle</b> (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|R
50|$|Orvietan was a {{concoction}} of partially toxic herbs, wine, and dissolved honey, but {{existed in}} powdered form too (sold in lead boxes). Patrizia Catellani and Renzo Console analyzed 35 different recipes for mixing orvietan, published between 1655 and 1857. The number of ingredients varies from 9 to 57. The most frequent 26 ingredients are: garden angelica, healing wolfsbane, birthwort, bistort, sweet flag, Carline thistle, dittany, gentian, masterwort, black salsify, tormentil, valerian, <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle,</b> dittany of Crete, rue, germander, laurel berries, juniper berries, cinnamon, cloves, viper meat, {{and the two}} concoctions mithridate and theriac, as well as white wine and honey.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{composition}} of Essiac is unclear, but it reportedly contains burdock (Arctium lappa), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), slippery elm bark (Ulmus rubra), and Indian rhubarb (Rheum officinale) or turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Some formulations may also contain watercress, <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle,</b> red clover, and kelp. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, {{who claimed that}} it had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated. However, this has never been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy, and there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American culture. Several of the plants in the mixture (burdock, sheep sorrel, Indian rhubarb and turkey rhubarb) are not indigenous to the Americas, and were not growing in the wilds of Northern Ontario during the time Caisse began prescribing this tea. The name [...] "Essiac" [...] is Caisse's surname spelled backwards. Today, Essiac is often sold with apparatus (such as bottles and infusers) for making the tea, and is sometimes promoted with untrue claims that scientific studies have shown it to be effective.|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} investigate the use of <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cnicus benedictus) in amelioration of fescue toxicosis in beef cattle. Twenty-seven crossbred Angus cows were blocked by age and weight into groups of three. Each group (n= 9) was then {{randomly assigned to one}} of three dietary treatments: endophyte-free (EF), endophyte-infected (EI), or endophyte-infected with addition of cut and stemmed <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> (EIBT). Each group was also {{randomly assigned to one of}} three 29 -day replicates. Parameters measured during this trial included: urinary ergot alkaloid concentration (ng ergot alkaloids/mg creatinine), body weight (kg), rectal temperature (°C), serum progesterone (ng/ml), and serum prolactin (ng/ml). No effect of treatment (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) was detected in any of these parameters. A treatment x time interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) was observed for progesterone concentrations, likely a result of estrous cyclicity of cows. Results of this study suggest that we were unsuccessful in inducing fescue toxicity in test subjects assigned to EI and EIBT treatments. Minimal dietary ergovaline (1. 72 μg kg- 1) and cool ambient temperatures (- 6. 7 °C to 23. 3 °C) likely contributed to this inability. Data from this research do suggest, however, that C. benedictus can be successfully incorporated into cattle diets. Further research will need to be performed to fully elucidate what, if any, benefits <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> can have in the treatment of fescue toxicity...|$|E
25|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the <b>blessed</b> milk <b>thistle</b> (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins that are returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|R
40|$|Fescue Toxicosis {{occurs when}} animals are fed or grazing on Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea) syn. (Lolium arudinacea [Schreb]) grass that is {{infected}} with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum (Bacon et al., 1977). This disease affects cattle, sheep, and horses causing reduced feed consumption, average daily gain (ADG), and reproductive performance (Hoveland, 2003). The disease is caused by ergot alkaloids within the fungus, which lives in the plant (Hoveland et al., 1980). Fescue toxicosis {{is a major concern}} because at least 35 million acres in the United States contain Tall Fescue (Faulkner, 1999); areas impacted include southern Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, northern Mississippi, northern Louisiana, Georgia, West Virginia, Arkansas and Missouri and in some areas of the Pacific coast such as Oregon (Roberts et al., 2004). Due to the effects of this disease, producers lose an estimated 609 million dollars per year (Paterson et. al, 1995). The aim of this research project was to determine if the herbal supplement, <b>Blessed</b> <b>Thistle,</b> could be used to counteract the effects of fescue toxicosis in cattle. Eighteen Angus first calf heifers and their calves were divided into three treatment groups (n = 6); negative control fed non-endophyte infected Max Q hay (EN), positive control fed endophyte infected KY- 31 fescue hay (E+), or treatment fed KY- 31 fescue hay and <b>Blessed</b> <b>Thistle</b> extract (E+/BT). Heifers fed E+/BT diet maintained pretreatment prolactin levels throughout the study. Additionally, the change in prolactin levels E- and E+/BT were not significantly different suggesting a protective effect from the <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle.</b> The change in heifer BCS was insignificant except for the E+/BT group which was significantly different (P = 0. 02) before and after. The differences between the calf weights were trending (P = 0. 088) indicating the ability of the E+/BT calves to perform similarly to the E- calves. The milk production estimate was insignificant (P = 0. 497). The rectal temperatures data indicated a difference {{at the beginning and end}} of the study (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). However, no differences were detected between treatment groups. These results suggest that <b>Blessed</b> <b>Thistle</b> can ameliorate some symptoms of fescue toxicosis however, further research is needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to document the negative effects of endophyte-infected fescue consumption on cow physiological responses after stress challenge and to assess the ability of <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> to ameliorate these responses. Twenty -seven Angus crossbred cows approximately 5 - 7 years of age and a body weight of (634 ± 80 kg) were equally divided into 3 treatments. Each treatment was divided into 3 replicates, leaving pens of 3 cows per treatment replicate. Each pen was balanced for initial body weight and low age. Each experimental group was {{randomly assigned to one of}} three replicates and one of three treatment dietary regimens: control/endophyte-free (EF) fescue, endophyte-infected (EI) fescue, endophyte-infected fescue + <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> supplementation (EIBT). Ergovaline, one alkaloid compound thought to be deleterious in the endophyte-infected fescue metabolites was detected in EI seed analysis performed before the trial commenced. Endophyte-free seed samples were negative for total ergot alkaloids. No treatment interaction was observed for heart rate, body temperature, prolactin and urinary alkaloid analysis rate (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). A replicate interaction was observed for prolactin (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was an effect of stress point between before and after samples taken on D- 1 and D 29 on body temperature, heart rate and cortisol (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results suggest treatments were ineffectual at inducing symptoms of fescue toxicosis. The full capability of <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> to ameliorate symptoms of fescue toxicosis may not be fully represented in this study. Further research and knowledge into the mechanism by which fescue toxicosis impacts health and productivity of livestock is needed to develop sustainable treatment regimens...|$|E
40|$|Ceratapion basicorne (Coleoptera: Apionidae) is a weevil {{native to}} Europe and western Asia {{that is being}} {{evaluated}} as a prospective classical biological control agent of Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) in the United States. Host plant specificity of the insect was evaluated in no-choice oviposition experiments. Feeding on leaf tissue by adult females was highly correlated to oviposition rate, both of which occurred primarily on plants in the tribe Cardueae, and {{especially those in the}} monophyletic subtribe Centaureinae. The highest rates of larval development occurred on Ce. solstitialis and Centaurea cyanus (bachelor’s button, garden cornflower), and there was significant development on Centaurea melitensis (Napa starthistle, tocalote), Cnicus benedictus (<b>blessed</b> <b>thistle),</b> Carthamus tinctorius (safflower), and Crupina vulgaris (common crupina). All the plants that supported some larval development are within a monophyletic clade within the Centaureinae. No native North American plants appear to be at risk of significant damage by this insect. Additional testing of safflower and bachelor’s button under choice conditions should complement these results to help determine the degree to which these plants are at risk...|$|E
40|$|Background: Centaurea cyanus is an endemic and {{well-known}} {{herbal medicine}} in Iran, is an annual flowering {{plant in the}} family of Asteraceae. The flowers are the part used in modern herbal medicine and are considered to have tonic, stimulant and emmenagogue properties, with action {{similar to that of}} <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle.</b> The aim {{this study was to investigate}} the phytochemical constituents of C. cyanus extract, its antioxidant, anti-tumor and anti-bacterial activities. Methods: This experimental study was conducted from June to January of 2015 in Islamic Azad University of Varamin, Iran. At first, the phytochemical components of C. cyanus extract was analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Subsequently, the antibacterial potential of the extract was evaluated against 4 pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Psedomonas aeroginosa and Klebsiella pnemoniae via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) mathod. Moreover, the anti-oxidant and anti-tumor activities of extract on colon cancer cell line (HT 29) were investigate using DPPH and MTT colorimetric methods, respectively. Finally, the Bax and Bcl 2 apoptosis gene expression level was analyzed by quantitative Real-time PCR technique. Results: GC-MS analysis of C. cyanus extract was shown 19 major components and the most frequent component was belonged to n-Hexadecanoic acid (36. 4 %) and Linoleic acid (19. 3 %). The maximum antibacterial activity of extract was observed on S. aureus and P. aeroginosa isolates. The antioxidant activity of the extract was 0. 109 ± 0. 07 mg/ml. Moreover, the MTT results show that extract had IC 50 = 26. 04 ± 0. 45 on HT 29 cell line. The Real-time PCR results showed the expression level of Bax and Bcl 2 was significantly increased and decreased respectively in colon cancer cell line (2. 63 ± 0. 54 (P< 0. 05), 0. 38 ± 0. 72 (P< 0. 05)). Conclusion: The results of this study show that the extract had significant anti-bacterial and anti-cancer effects and it appear that the extract has potential uses for pharmaceutical industries...|$|E
40|$|Background: Main {{concerns}} for lactating women about medications include {{the safety of}} their breastfed infants and the potential effects of medication on quantity and quality of breast milk. While medicine treatments include conventional and complementary medicines, most studies to date have focused on evaluating the safety aspect of conventional medicines. Despite increasing popularity of herbal medicines, there are currently limited data available on the pattern of use and safety of these medicines during breastfeeding. This study aimed to identify the pattern of use of herbal medicines during breastfeeding in Perth, Western Australia, and to identify aspects which require further clinical research. Methods: This study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire validated through two pilot studies. Participants were 18 years or older, breastfeeding or had breastfed in the past 12 months. Participants were recruited from various community and health centres, and through advertising in newspapers. Simple descriptive statistics were used to summarise the demographic profile and attitudes of respondents, using the SPSS statistical software. Results: A total of 304 questionnaires from eligible participants were returned (27. 2 % response rate) and analysed. Amongst the respondents, 59. 9 % took at least one herb for medicinal purposes during breastfeeding, whilst 24. 3 % reported the use of at least one herb to increase breast milk supply. Most commonly used herbs were fenugreek (18. 4 %), ginger (11. 8 %), dong quai (7. 9 %), chamomile (7. 2 %), garlic (6. 6 %) and <b>blessed</b> <b>thistle</b> (5. 9 %). The majority of participants (70. 1 %) believed that {{there was a lack of}} information resources, whilst 43. 4 % perceived herbal medicines to be safer than conventional medicines. Only 28. 6 % of users notified their doctor of their decision to use herbal medicine (s) during breastfeeding; 71. 6 % had previously refused or avoided conventional medicine treatments due to concerns regarding safety of their breastfed infants. Conclusions: The use of herbal medicines is common amongst breastfeeding women, while information supporting their safety and efficacy is lacking. This study has demonstrated the need for further research into commonly used herbal medicines. Evidence-based information should be available to breastfeeding women who wish to consider use of all medicines, including complementary medicines, to avoid unnecessary cessation of breastfeeding or compromising of pharmacotherapy...|$|E
