50|$|Torreyanic acid is a dimeric quinone first {{isolated}} and by Lee et al. in 1996 from an endophyte, Pestalotisopsis microspora. This endophyte is likely {{the cause of}} the decline of Florida torreya (Torreya taxifolia), an endangered species that is related to the taxol-producing Taxus brevifolia. The natural product was found to be cytotoxic against 25 different human cancer cell lines with an average IC50 value of 9.4 µg/mL, ranging from 3.5 (NEC) to 45 (A549) µg/mL. Torreyanic acid was found to be 5-10 times more potent in cell lines sensitive to protein kinase C (PKC) agonists, 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and was shown to cause cell death via apoptosis. Torreyanic acid also promoted G1 arrest of G0 cynchronized cells at 1-5 µg/mL levels, depending on the cell line.

The DNA degradation observed in protoplasts (Fig.  4) could lead to the inhibition of cell growth and cell death. It has been argued that DNA is a direct target of Al 3 + in biological systems.

Prerequisite for the co-expression is stoichiometric and coordinated expression of two or more proteins from a single transgenic locus. Achieving co-expression of transgenes using conventional techniques results into increased number of independently assorting loci, inadequate expression levels, and problems due to gene silencing. In this study, we constructed a chimeric polyprotein containing Dm-AMP 1 with native signal peptide, 16 -amino-acid-linker peptide of the Ib-AMP precursor and Rs-AFP 2 proteins driven by maize ubiquitin promoter and expressed it in rice. Because of its small size, the Ib-AMP precursor protein is an ideal system for coordinated expression of multiple genes. Dm-AMP 1 and Rs-AFP 2 show in vitro antifungal activity against several agronomically important fungal pathogens at micromolar concentration and have different <b>biochemical</b> <b>targets</b> that are important for durable and broad-spectrum resistance (Terras et al. 1995; Thevissen et al. 2004).

GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of several metabolites, i. e. mostly aromatic esters.

The vector control is achieved by reducing vector density, interrupting their life cycle, and creating a barrier between the human host and mosquitoes. A number of vaccine candidates are being clinically tried and R&D effort in this direction is coming in a big way. Currently there are only limited safe drugs {{for the treatment of}} this disease, however, reports of emerging resistance against existing drugs warrant the introduction of new drugs, which are unlikely to come from pharmaceutical industries because of limited commercial opportunities.

40|$|International audienceHerbicide {{impact is}} usually {{assessed}} {{as the result}} of a unilinear mode of action on a specific <b>biochemical</b> <b>target</b> with a typical dose-response dynamics. Recent developments in plant molecular signaling and crosstalk between nutritional, hormonal and environmental stress cues are however revealing a more complex picture of inclusive toxicity. Herbicides induce large-scale metabolic and gene-expression effects that go far beyond the expected consequences of unilinear herbicide-target-damage mechanisms. Moreover, groundbreaking studies have revealed that herbicide action and responses strongly interact with hormone signaling pathways, with numerous regulatory protein-kinases and -phosphatases, with metabolic and circadian clock regulators and with oxidative stress signaling pathways. These interactions are likely to result in mechanisms of adjustment that can determine the level of sensitivity or tolerance to a given herbicide or to a mixture of herbicides depending on the environmental and developmental status of the plant. Such regulations can be described as rheostatic and their importance is discussed in relation with herbicide use strategies, environmental risk assessment and global change assessment challenges.
