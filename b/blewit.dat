60|$|Some of {{our common}} soldiery are, and I hope unjustly, suspected. This may be easily confuted, if strict orders are enforced, that none but {{commission}} or warrant officers shall be out of their quarters after ten at night. But if we consider, that neither <b>Blewit,</b> Bunworth, or their gangs, were soldiers, and that {{of those who have}} been executed for ten years past, not one in ten were soldiers, but, on the contrary, seamen discharged and thrown on the public without present subsistence, which makes them desperate; but I hope the act now depending for the encouragement of seamen, &c., will sufficiently remove that obstacle also. This, I hope, will stop the mouths of censorious persons, who unjustly arraign our soldiery for the vices of others. However, to make all easy, I believe the generality of them will gladly submit to the restraint proposed, merely to show their innocence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blewit</b> {{refers to}} two {{closely related species}} of edible agarics in the genus Clitocybe, the wood <b>blewit</b> (Clitocybe nuda) and the field <b>blewit</b> or blue-leg (C.saeva). Both species are treated by some {{authorities}} as belonging to the genus Lepista.|$|E

5000|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} known as the wood <b>blewit.</b> Cooke called it the amethyst lepista, John Sibthorp called it the blue-gilled agaric in his 1794 work Flora Oxoniensis, ...|$|E
50|$|German mycologist Paul Kummer {{placed it}} in the genus Tricholoma in 1871, {{the same year that}} English {{botanist}} Mordecai Cubitt Cooke {{placed it in}} Lepista. It was known by these names for many years, with some authors accepting Lepista and while others retained the wood <b>blewit</b> in Tricholoma. In 1969 Howard E. Bigelow and Alexander H. Smith reviewed Lepista and reclassified it as a subgenus of Clitocybe Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja has called for the sinking of Lepista into Clitocybe, with C. nebularis as the type species of the latter genus. Hence the wood <b>blewit</b> is classified as either Lepista nuda or Clitocybe nuda.|$|E
50|$|The wood <b>blewit</b> {{is found}} in Europe and North America and is {{becoming}} more common in Australia, where {{it appears to have}} been introduced. It is a saprotrophic species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December.|$|E
50|$|Field <b>blewits</b> {{are often}} infested with fly larvae and don't store very well; they should {{therefore}} be used soon after picking. They are also very porous, so they are best picked on a dry day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blewits</b> can {{be eaten}} as a cream sauce or sautéed in butter. They {{can also be}} cooked like tripe or as omelette filling, and also make good stewing mushrooms. They have a strong flavour, so they combine well with leeks or onions.|$|R
50|$|In this leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member {{had to find}} a store display {{containing}} three different types of mushrooms (grey oysters, wood <b>blewits,</b> and shiitake). Using one of the baskets they picked up at the train station, they then had to enter an underground mushroom farm, find the same three types of mushrooms, and collect 10 of each variety. If they found the correct three mushroom types, the shopkeeper would give them their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Soil {{analysis}} of soil containing mycelium from a wood <b>blewit</b> (Clitocybe nuda) fairy ring under Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated {{low molecular weight}} organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.|$|E
50|$|Clitocybe nuda, {{commonly}} known as the wood <b>blewit</b> and alternately described as Lepista nuda, is an edible mushroom native to Europe and North America. Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790, it was also known as Tricholoma nudum for many years. It is found in both coniferous and deciduous woodlands. It is a fairly distinctive mushroom that is widely eaten, though there is some caution about edibility. Nevertheless, it has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France.|$|E
50|$|The variety lilacina {{is similar}} in shape but tinted lilac all over, with an ochre-brown flush on the cap umbo and {{the base of the}} stem. It has a strong mealy or earthy odour. This variety could be mistaken for the edible {{amethyst}} deceiver (Laccaria amethystina), although the latter species has a fibrous stipe, a fruity smell and lacks the ochre-coloured umbo. It is a similar coloration to the wood <b>blewit,</b> although mushrooms of that species generally grow much larger.|$|E
50|$|This {{mushroom}} {{can range}} from lilac to purple-pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. The gills {{are attached to the}} short, stout stem. Mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap; younger ones are lighter with more convex caps. Wood <b>blewits</b> have a very distinctive odor, which has been likened by one author to that of frozen orange juice.|$|R
50|$|A 2015 genetic {{study found}} that the genera Collybia and Lepista were closely related to the core clade of Clitocybe, but that all three were polyphyletic, with many members in {{lineages}} removed from other members of the same genus and instead more closely related to the other two. To complicate matters, the wood <b>blewit</b> is not closely related to the type species of Lepista, L. densifolia. Alvarado and colleagues declined to define the genera but proposed several options and highlighted the need for a wider analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The French mycologist Pierre Bulliard {{described}} the wood <b>blewit</b> {{in his work}} Herbier de la France in 1790 as Agaricus nudus, reporting that it was common in the woods all year. He wrote of two varieties: one whose gills and cap are initially light violet and mature to burgundy, while the other has vine-coloured gills that intensify in colour with age. He added that the first variety was often confused with Cortinarius violaceus, though it has a [...] "nude" [...] cap and no spidery web veil unlike the other species. [...] English naturalist James Bolton gave it the name Agaricus bulbosa—the bulbous agaric—in his An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax in 1791. He noted that it was rare in the region, though had found some in Ovenden.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of histone 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) methylation on the mouse inactive X chromosome has been controversial {{over the last}} 15 years, and the functional role of H 3 K 9 methylation in X chromosome inactivation in any species has remained largely unexplored. Results: Here we report the first genomic analysis of H 3 K 9 di- and tri-methylation on the inactive X: we find they are enriched at the intergenic, gene poor regions of the inactive X, interspersed between H 3 K 27 tri-methylation domains found in the gene dense regions. Although H 3 K 9 methylation is predominantly non-genic, we find that depletion of H 3 K 9 methylation via depletion of H 3 K 9 methyltransferase Set domain bifurcated 1 (Setdb 1) during the establishment of X inactivation, results in failure of silencing for around 150 genes on the inactive X. By contrast, we find a very minor role for Setdb 1 -mediated H 3 K 9 methylation once X inactivation is fully established. In addition to failed gene silencing, we observed a specific failure to silence X-linked long-terminal repeat class repetitive elements. Conclusions: Here we have shown that H 3 K 9 methylation clearly marks the murine inactive X chromosome. The role of this mark is most apparent during the establishment phase of gene silencing, with a more muted effect on maintenance of the silent state. Based on our data, we hypothesise that Setdb 1 -mediated H 3 K 9 methylation {{plays a role in}} epigenetic silencing of the inactive X via silencing of the repeats, which itself facilitates gene silencing through alterations to the conformation of the whole inactive X chromosome.
