5|$|The Seneca Nation availed {{itself of}} the act in {{bringing}} this action, which was subject to the provision, as held by the court of appeals, that {{it could only be}} brought and maintained ‘in the same manner and within the same time as if brought by citizens of this state in relation to their private individual property and rights.’ Under the circumstances, the fact that the plaintiff was an Indian tribe cannot make federal questions of the correct construction {{of the act}} and the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute of limitations.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the <b>Bar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E

5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Harlan {{volunteered for}} {{military}} duty, {{serving as a}} colonel in the United States Army Air Force from 1943 to 1945. He was {{the chief of the}} Operational Analysis Section of the Eighth Air Force in England. He won the Legion of Merit from the United States, and the Croix de guerre from both France and Belgium. In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing Du Pont family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas. During this period Harlan also served as a committee chairman of the Association of the <b>Bar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City of New York, and to which he was later elected vice president. Harlan's main specialization at that time was corporate and anti-trust law.|$|E

5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E

40|$|ICRH {{has proved}} to be an {{efficient}} method <b>of</b> heating <b>the</b> plasma in toroidal devices. The high voltages needed at the coupling structure are, however, a severe handicap <b>of</b> this method. <b>The</b> possibility is investigated <b>of</b> having <b>the</b> highest voltages between <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faraday shield (FS), where they are both necessary and easier to maintain. For this purpose a resonant Faraday shield (RFS) antenna where the first and last <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FS are connected by an inductive strip is proposed. In front of this strip there is a second strip, fed, as in a conventional antenna, by an RF generator. It is shown that if <b>the</b> toroidal length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FS is larger lambda/ 2 the strip connecting <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FS acts as <b>the</b> secondary coil <b>of</b> a tuned transformer, the strip fed by the generator being the primary. It is therefore possible, by varying the frequency and the distance between the two strips, i. e. the coupling coefficient, to match <b>the</b> impedance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generator...|$|R
