40|$|Abstract Leather plays a {{vital role}} in earning the foreign {{currency}} for Bangladesh. Export of finished leather and leather products have an important impact on the economy of Bangladesh. Mainly cow goat sheep and <b>buffalo</b> <b>leathers</b> are produced in this country. Different defects of leather due to numerous numbers of diseases of animals of poor management of people deteriorate the quality of leather which has negative impact in this sector. This paper analyses the magnitude and category of major defects in case of cow goat and buffalo of Bangladesh. We have studied in sixteen tanneries of Hazaribagh Dhaka where 95 tanneries of the whole country are situated. This study found that in case of cow skin hair slip parasitic skin diseases wound and pox are mainly responsible for the defects in leather in raw condition. Again in case of the wet blue leather of cow flay cut pox mark parasitic diseases growth mark wound sun burn scratch dark mole are responsible for the defects. Further for crust leather of cow flay cut parasitic diseases pox looseness for bating scratch wrinkle grain damage are found as the reason of defects. In case of goat parasitic diseases pox growth mark mole scratch flay cut hair slip were found responsible mostly for the defects in Bangladesh. Moreover parasite pox wound branding growth mark wrinkle jam wrinkle mole scratch flay cut curing have been detected for the defects of buffalo in this country. Again in this study it is found that average leather grade A-D is 15 E-F is 25 G-H is 30 HH is 12. 5 and again the rejection is 18. 43. It is observed that most of the defects occur during animal life period. The rest of the defects happen during slaughter flaying preservation and processing period of hides and skins into leather. By proper caring of the farm level and at the point of slaughter and flaying desired quality of hides and skins could be obtained...|$|R

6000|$|Coverlets.--General Remarks.--For {{an upper}} cover, {{it is of}} {{importance}} to an otherwise unsheltered person, that its texture should be such as to prevent the wind blowing through. If it does so, no thickness is of any avail in keeping out the cold; hence the advantage of skin carosses, <b>buffalo</b> robes, <b>leather</b> sheets, and macintosh rugs. All clothes lose much of their closeness of texture in a hot, dry climate; the fibres shrink extremely, and the wind blows through the tissue as through network. It is {{in order to make}} their coverings wind-proof, that shepherd-lads on the hills in Scotland, when the nights are cold, dip their plaids in water, before sitting or lying down in them. The wet swells up the fibres of the plaid, and makes the texture of it perfectly dense and close. It is also of importance that the outer covering should have a certain weight, {{so as not to be}} too easily displaced, either by the person fidgeting in his sleep or by the blowing of the wind. In dry weather there is nothing like furs; but in a rainy country I prefer a thick blanket bag (see [...] "Sleeping Bags"), a large spare blanket, and a macintosh sheet and counterpane. It may be objected that the bag and macintosh would be close and stuffy, but be assured that the difficulty when sleeping on mother earth, on a bitter night, is to keep the fresh air out, not to let it in. On fine nights I should sleep on the bag and under the spare blanket.|$|R

Emblems on the exterior body were deleted in the scheme of the SPG, with only the word SAAB and the Saab-Scania roundel on the trunk appearing on the car. The car was fitted with the standard Saab grille for the period, but did not feature the miniature [...] "turbo emblem." [...] The SPG suspension was not fitted, and aside from the SPG body fairings and dash emblem, the SIS is identical to a standard 1988 900 Turbo Convertible in the black/grey color combination. The cars were sold, one to each dealer, however some dealers used the opportunity to trade their SiS convertible with other dealers {{in an effort to get}} other car models (specifically the 9000CD) for sale. Contrary to popular belief, the SIS was not given to the dealers for free. Dealers paid for their own car, the invoice price even reflected the increased cost of the SPG bodywork. Each dealer did however receive an Orrefors crystal vase, engraved with the Saab-Scania logo, packed in the trunk when the SIS was delivered stateside as a surprise gift.

40|$|Leather {{industry}} and leather goods industry in Indonesia reached {{the peak in}} 1986 - 1996. Export of leather products (shoes, gloves, and jackets) contributed U. S. 2. 4 billion to the government. Export of leather and leather products ranks third on the non-oil exports, the level after the export of textiles and wood. Since the economic crisis in Indonesia in 1997, nearly all industry sectors were collapsed, including the leather and leather products industry (Untari et al., 2009). The fundamental problem that occurs {{in the development of}} the domestic leather industry was the problem of raw materials. The supply of raw material is influenced by various factors such as human as the subject, animals as the objects, land as an ecology base and technology as a tool skills (Suhud, 1989). The human factor plays an important role in this aspect of the supply of raw materials. It is associated with the activity and production process, including production management, health, feeding and increasing population and genetic improvement. Another factor is the skill associated with human slaughterhouse. Leather raw material quality is affected directly by the butcher skills in the process of debarking. One of the problems faced by the leather {{industry and}} leather goods industry in Indonesia is availability of raw materials. While the demand from various countries for goods made of leather is increasing, the ability of the domestic leather industry to provide the products are still very low due to insufficient supply of raw materials.

40|$|Bison history {{captures the}} American imagination. Robinson capitalizes on this {{interest}} here with an entertaining narrative about buffalo hunters. The book {{begins with a}} synopsis of Native American bison hunting practices {{both before and after}} the acquisition of the horse, an animal whose impact dramatically transformed and increased indigenous dependence on the buffalo. The author moves on to address the role Native Americans played in supplying bison beef to British-Canadian fur companies and buffalo robes to their American counterparts. The story then quickly moves on to Euro-American sport hunting which reached its heyday with the completion of the transcontinental railroad. Buffalo Bill Cody and his associates such as Grand Duke Alexis and George Armstrong Custer dominate this discussion which initiates the book 2 ̆ 7 s primary focus: white hunters. Robinson notes that bison hunting became exceptionally lucrative after the discovery of a process to convert buffalo hides into industrial grade leather in 1870. He provides anecdotes about various hide hunters, most notably J. Wright Mooar, and a few statistics of reported bison kills and hide shipments to document the extermination of the southern herd. He then moves on to describe Native American resistance to commercial buffalo-hide hunters and the growth of hide towns like Dodge City, Kansas, and Fort Griffin, Texas. The final chapter compares the extermination of the northern herd in the 1880 s with that of the southern herd. The author justifies the brevity of his attention to the northern situation by explaining that the area contained fewer bison and these more quickly vanished. Three themes pervade this work. First, buffalo hunters-both native and white-did both 2 ̆ 2 great and terrible deeds 2 ̆ 2 ranging from courageous work to over-harvesting. Second, economics dictated the importance of bison hunting. Native Americans wasted bison products until they witnessed a scarcity and then fought to preserve their resource base. White hunters flocked to the Plains only after increasing hide prices lured them. Robinson explains, 2 ̆ 2 With the development of industrial grade <b>buffalo</b> <b>leather,</b> the fate of the animal was sealed. 2 ̆ 2 Third, the army supported buffalo hunting 2 ̆ 2 in an effort to control the Indians. 2 ̆ 2 Military outposts even supplied free ammunition and powder to the Indians for this purpose. Buffalo Hunters may disappoint some bison history researchers due to its brevity, scant original research, cursory discussion of bison hunting during the fur trade era, and insufficient use of statistics. However, the colorful narrative and numerous uncommon supporting illustrations make this book a delightful read. Many academics could add to their library with this balanced anecdotal interpretation. Moreover, Robinson gives the general readership valuable insight into human ecology and the development of the United States. This book enhances western Americana literature...|$|E
