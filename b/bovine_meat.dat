40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAndrew P. BarkleyThe {{impact of}} {{agricultural}} trade liberalization on welfare {{is a major}} concern to the Government of Morocco. Several agricultural sectors and sub-sectors that are suffering from severe inefficiencies have been protected by the Government mainly through prohibitive import tariffs as a mean to support the income of domestic producers. Although the rhetoric in Morocco is of trade liberalization, the farm sector, with few exceptions, has largely escaped the general tendency. 		The livestock sector in general and the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> production in particular figure among the most protected goods in the country. <b>Bovine</b> <b>meat</b> imports are imposed a prohibitive tariff rate of 254 percent. In addition, several technical barriers to trade exist in the form of rigid sanitary regulations. 		It is strategically important for Morocco's trade partners and those that are planning to negotiate different forms of trade agreements to understand the economic argument behind Moroccan protectionist policy in agriculture. The <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> market in Morocco is of high interest to major exporters given the growing size in domestic and tourist populations, the high domestic prices, as well as the increase in consumer awareness. Given its good sanitary status, Australia is a strong candidate for negotiating an agreement that will include <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> within a general agricultural package. 		The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate economic evidence and determine whether or not opening up trade of <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> will have a net positive impact on welfare. Such evidence can become a strong argument in the hands of trade negotiators for major exporting nations such as Australia. 	This study uses data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco and Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) to construct a partial equilibrium model for the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> market. The model simulates different trade policies: closed market, free trade, quota and TRQ.
