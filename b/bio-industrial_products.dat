40|$|The {{benefits}} of applying a low sedimental fluid shear environment to manipulate microorganisms were examined. Microorganisms {{obtained from a}} low sedimental fluid shear culture, which exhibit modified phenotypic and molecular genetic characteristics, are useful {{for the development of}} novel and improved diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and <b>bio-industrial</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, application of low sedimental fluid conditions to microorganisms permits identification of molecules uniquely expressed under these conditions, providing a basis for the design of new therapeutic targets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sorghum {{is mainly}} {{used as a}} human food and {{beverage}} source, playing {{an important role in}} the production of ethanol and other <b>bio-industrial</b> <b>products.</b> Thus it is regarded as a model crop for energy plants. Genetic map construction is the foundation for marker-assisted selection and gene cloning. So far several sorghum linkage maps have been reported using different kinds of molecular markers. However marker numbers and chromosome coverage are limited. As a result, it is difficult to get consistent results and the maps are hard to unify. In the present study, the genomes of 130 individuals consisting an F 2 population together with their parents were surveyed using a high-throughput sequencing technique. A high-density linkage map was constructed using specific-locus amplified fragments (SLAF) markers. This map can provide information and serve as a reference for effective gene exploration, and for marker assisted-breeding program. Results A high-throughput sequencing method was adopted to screen SLAF markers with 1300 F 2 individuals from a cross between a grain sorghum variety, J 204, and a sweet sorghum variety, Keter. In the present study, 52, 928 suitable SLAF markers out of 43, 528, 021 pair-end reads were chosen to conduct genetic map construction, 12. 0...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{transgenic}} triticale as {{a platform}} for novel <b>bio-industrial</b> <b>products</b> is predicated on an envi-ronmental biosafety assessment that quantifies the potential risks associated with its release. Pollen-mediated gene flow to related species and conventional triticale varieties is one pathway for transgene movement. A tier 1 quantification of triticale hybridization was conducted by emasculating and hand pollinating flowers un-der greenhouse conditions. Approximately 2000 manual pollinations were conducted for each cross and its reciprocal between two triticale genotypes: a modern triticale cultivar (AC Alta) and primary triticale (89 TT 108), and common wheat, durum wheat and rye. The frequency of outcrossing, hybrid seed appearance and weight, and F 1 emergence and fertility were recorded. Outcrossing, F 1 emergence and fertility rates were high from crosses between triticale genotypes. Outcrossing in inter-specific crosses {{was influenced by the}} species, and the genotype and gender of the triticale parent. In crosses to common and durum wheat where triticale was the male parent, outcrossing was ≥ 73. 0 % and ≥ 69. 5 %, respectively, but ≤ 23. 9 % and ≤ 3. 0 % when triticale was the female parent. Overall, outcrossing with rye was lower than with common and durum wheat. F 1 hybrid emer-gence was greater when triticale was the female parent. With the exception of a single seed, all wheat-triticale F 1 hybrid seeds were non-viable when triticale was the male parent in the cross. Only seven durum wheat-triticale F 1 hybrids emerged from 163 seeds sown, and all were produced with triticale 89 TT 108 as female parent. Wit...|$|E
