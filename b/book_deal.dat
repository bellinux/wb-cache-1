5|$|In May 1988, Gingrich (along with 77 other House {{members and}} Common Cause) brought ethics charges against Democratic Speaker Jim Wright, who was {{alleged to have}} used a <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> to {{circumvent}} campaign-finance laws and House ethics rules. During the investigation, {{it was reported that}} Gingrich had his own unusual <b>book</b> <b>deal,</b> for Window of Opportunity, in which publicity expenses were covered by a limited partnership. It raised $105,000 from Republican political supporters to promote sales of Gingrich's book. Gingrich's success in forcing Wright's resignation contributed to his rising influence in the Republican caucus.|$|E
5|$|Couillard first {{appeared}} in the national media when she dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The Bernier-Couillard Affair erupted in May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a <b>book</b> <b>deal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Applying the {{proceeds}} of a <b>book</b> <b>deal,</b> the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago. The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.|$|E
5|$|The couple first {{wrote about}} the {{experience}} in articles for the online magazine The Tyee. The popularity of the articles led to a <b>book</b> <b>deal.</b> In the book, Smith and MacKinnon each write alternate chapters, 12 in total. The first chapter is written by MacKinnon and focuses on {{the first month of}} their experience. They write in the first person as a memoir that explores their own dietary experiences and personal feelings.|$|E
5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a <b>book</b> <b>deal,</b> with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E

5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took its toll on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a <b>book</b> <b>deal,</b> covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first major}} book, What Not to Wear, was {{published}} in 2002. It gained them a British Book Award in 2003 for The TV & Film Book of the Year. The book outsold popular television chefs Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson when sale figures reached a total of 670,000 copies, selling 300,000 copies in just fifteen weeks. It was also selling 45,000 copies a week at one point, and had sold 250,000 copies before the peak book selling season had even begun. What Not to Wear made sales worth £8.7 million {{which led to a}} £2 million <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> to produce more of their fashion books.|$|E
5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E

25|$|Publishers were {{interested}} in signing Felt to a <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> after the revelation. Weeks after the Vanity Fair article was released, PublicAffairs Books, whose CEO was a Washington Post reporter and editor during the Watergate era, announced that it signed a deal with Felt.

25|$|The court {{accepted}} that Carr had only {{lied to the}} police to protect Huntley because she believed his claims of innocence and so found her not guilty of assisting an offender, deciding {{that she had been}} unaware that Huntley had committed the murders. She was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and was released on probation on 14 May 2004 after serving 21 months (including 16 months on remand). She was given a new secret identity to protect her from threats of attack from members of the public that had been made during her remand, as well as during and after the trial. After release, Carr and her family were negotiating towards an autobiographical <b>book</b> <b>deal,</b> but Mirage Publishing withdrew after a feature on BBC Radio Newcastle prompted scores of objections.|$|E
500|$|Truman {{took out}} a {{personal}} loan from a Missouri bank shortly after leaving office, and then found a lucrative <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> for his memoirs. For the memoirs, Truman received only a flat payment of $670,000, and had to pay two-thirds of that in tax; he calculated he got $37,000 after he paid his assistants. [...] However, the memoirs were a commercial and critical success; they were published in two volumes in 1955 and 1956 by Doubleday (Garden City, N.Y) and Hodder & Stoughton (London): Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Year of Decisions and Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Years of Trial and Hope.|$|E

500|$|She got {{in touch}} with book {{publisher}} Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish the book after a brief phone call, without first receiving a draft of the work. In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After Robert D. Kaplan {{referenced}} Homer-Dixon's {{work in the}} 1994 The Atlantic Monthly article, [...] "The Coming Anarchy", Homer-Dixon {{was offered}} a <b>book</b> <b>deal.</b> He spent the next half decade preparing until it was finally published in 2000 in North America and the United Kingdom. While it spent three weeks at #1 on a Canadian best-seller list, it did not sell many copies in the United States. Critics were pleased with Homer-Dixon's scholarship, straightforward presentation, and the book's breadth but some found the writing to have a self-indulgent quality. Homer-Dixon was awarded the Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction in 2001 and the book went on to be translated into French and Spanish.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, Gillard {{signed a}} <b>book</b> <b>deal</b> for her memoirs with Penguin Australia. The autobiography, My Story, was {{published}} in 2014 by Random House. In the book, Gillard reflects on various personal aspects {{of her life and}} career, including her own analysis of the people and key players during the Rudd–Gillard Governments. Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been [...] "infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot box full of voting papers he had somehow procured", which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement. Following requests from Xenophon for a personal apology from Gillard, on 6 August 2015 she published a personal apology to him in a number of Australian newspapers.|$|E
