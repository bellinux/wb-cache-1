5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> from ITS {{and large}} subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa {{belongs in the}} Tricholomataceae family. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L.decorosa does not belong in the family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E
5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} series of {{experiments}} examining whether people ascribe knowledge for true beliefs <b>based</b> <b>on</b> probabilistic <b>evidence.</b> Participants {{were less likely to}} ascribe knowledge for beliefs <b>based</b> <b>on</b> probabilistic <b>evidence</b> than for beliefs <b>based</b> <b>on</b> perceptual <b>evidence</b> (Experiments 1 and 2 A) or testimony providing causal information (Experiment 2 B). Denial of knowledge for beliefs <b>based</b> <b>on</b> probabilistic <b>evidence</b> did not arise because participants viewed such beliefs as unjustified, nor because such beliefs leave open the possibility of error. These findings rule out traditional philosophical accounts for why probabilistic evidence does not produce knowledge. The experiments instead suggest that people deny knowledge because they distrust drawing conclusions about an individual <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reasoning about the population to which it belong, a tendency previously identified by "judgment and decision making" researchers. Consistent with this, participants were more willing to ascribe knowledge for beliefs <b>based</b> <b>on</b> probabilistic <b>evidence</b> that is specific to a particular case (Experiments 3 A and 3 B) ...|$|R

5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle {{was located in}} an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path. Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants, and the circulation became better defined. Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center far removed from the convection. By later that day, the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> of a weak warm-core, the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185miles (300km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
5|$|Nickell {{continued}} {{to maintain her}} innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A second appeal, beginning in 2001 was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment.|$|E
5|$|Now that orca {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} for several decades, the exact age of many younger whales is known. The age of older orcas, such as Granny, is estimated by their offspring; they give birth around age 15, and stop having offspring around 40; by adding the generations together, ages can be estimated. Granny was photographed in 1971 with a male orca, J1 Ruffles, who was believed at the time to be her son. Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old, and as scientists believed him to be Granny's last offspring, her own age was estimated at about 60. It was later discovered that Ruffles was not Granny's son, but her age estimate was never changed. Granny's age was originally estimated with a margin of error of 12 years, but was the subject of an academic dispute in 2016 due to her original age being <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> now known to be incorrect, as well as a large disparity between the life expectancy of orcas with estimated ages and orcas with known ages. Analysis of fatty acids from a recent biopsy of Granny indicated that Granny may have only been 65-80 years of age.|$|E

5|$|The Glades {{culture is}} divided into three periods <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>evidence</b> found in middens. In 1947, {{archaeologist}} John Goggin described the three periods after examining shell mounds. He excavated one on Matecumbe Key, another at Gordon Pass near modern-day Naples, and a third south of Lake Okeechobee near modern-day Belle Glade. The Glades I culture, lasting from 500 BCE to 800 CE, was apparently focused around Gordon Pass and is considered the least sophisticated {{due to the lack of}} artifacts. What has been found—primarily pottery—is gritty and plain. With the advent of a well-established culture in 800 CE, the Glades II period is characterized by more ornate pottery, wide use of tools throughout the South Florida region, and the appearance of religious artifacts at burial sites. By 1200, the Glades III culture exhibited the height of their development. Pottery became ornate enough to be subdivided into types of decoration. More importantly, evidence of an expanding culture is revealed through the development of ceremonial ornaments made from shell, and the construction of large earthworks associated with burial rituals. From the Glades III culture developed two distinct tribes that lived in and near the Everglades: the Calusa and the Tequesta.|$|E
