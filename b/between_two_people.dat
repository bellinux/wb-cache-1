5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who are in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light.

Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E

5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E

25|$|Consider {{also the}} {{transformation}} of intimacy. Giddens asserts that intimate social relationships have become 'democratised', so that the bond between partners – even within a marriage – {{has little to do}} with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but is based on the internal understanding <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> – a trusting bond based on emotional communication. Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved. Thus we have 'a democracy of the emotions in everyday life' (Runaway World, 1999).|$|E
25|$|The edges may be {{directed}} or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent {{people at a}} party, {{and there is an}} edge <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if any edge from a person A to a person B corresponds to As admiring B, then this graph is directed, because admiration is not necessarily reciprocated. The former type of graph is called an undirected graph and the edges are called undirected edges while the latter type of graph is called a directed graph and the edges are called directed edges.|$|E

25|$|Su Wu (140 - 60 BC) {{was held}} captive for 19 years, {{returning}} to China in 81 BC: 4 poems {{collected in the}} Wen Xuan are only questionably attributed to him. However, at the time, it was not uncustomary to confuse the persona of a poem with {{the person of the}} author. There is a story about Su Wu which became a common allusion in Chinese poetry. According to this story, during the beginning of his captivity in the Xiongnu empire Su Wu was treated harshly, to the point it is said of having to eat the lining of his coat for food and to drink snow which he melted for water. Later Su was elevated in status, even it is said given a wife who bore him children. Upon the Han emperor sending an ambassadorial mission toward the territory in which he was being held, the Xiongnu ruler (the chanyu) wished to conceal the presence of Su Wu, presumably in order avoid diplomatic complications; but, Su Wu hearing of this tricked the chanyu by claiming that he had sent a message to the emperor by tying it to the leg of a goose, and accordingly, that since his presence was already known to the Chinese delegation that any attempts at concealing his presence would be viewed as unseemly. This is {{at least part of the}} origin of the use of the image of a flying goose as a messenger, carrying tied to its foot (perhaps symbolically) a letter <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> separated so far seasonally north and south that a migrating goose could be conceived as a possible mode of communication.|$|E

40|$|The article investigates motifs from medieval {{sources and}} sources from early modern {{times in which}} the {{relationship}} between the Sami people and their Nordic neighbours is expressed in terms of family associations. During Romanticism it became a custom among Scandinavians to speak about each other as broderfolk, which in English is sister nations. In Old Norse sources it was the Sami people who were spoken of as “family,” but of a slightly more distant type than siblings. Haraldr hárfagri, who united Norway, married a Sami girl, Snæfríðr. Their marriage, which was a complicated one, may be seen as a symbolic expression of the problematic and loving relationship <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>peoples.</b> The king was the foster-son of the Sami people. To express the relationship <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>peoples</b> in terms of foster-child/foster-parent relations creates a picture with a very clear symbolic meaning. The kings of Norway from Haraldr harðráði on traced their family back to a Sami girl, and the earls of Hlaðir traced their family back to Sæmingr, probably the Proto-Sami. It may have been important, at least as a symbolic expression of community, that the princely houses of Norway had family roots in both peoples of the kingdom...|$|R
