Since 1 January 2013 there have been three main types of Master Point. Green points are won in events of national standing and are necessary for the acquisition of certain senior ranks. The value of a Green Point is 100 Master <b>Points.</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>points</b> are awarded in the next level of competition. The value of a <b>Blue</b> <b>Point</b> is 100 Master Points and all Master Points ranks will allow up to 50 Green points to be replaced by <b>Blue</b> <b>Points</b> in the ratio of 3 Blues = 1 Green.
