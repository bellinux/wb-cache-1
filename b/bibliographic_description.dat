40|$|ABSTRACT The article {{deals with}} {{different}} approaches to creating a personal bibliography of a composer’s opus. Methods of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>descriptions</b> of musical works in general bibliographies were examined with special emphasis on a thorough examination of methods of creating personal bibliographies of Slovenian composers {{from the beginning to}} the present. Special attention was given to the bibliographies of Emil Adamič, the first one dating in 1937 and the new one from the year 2004, and the bibliography of Vasilij Mirk. Three different approaches were identified. Bibliographic records are arranged according to the form of musical works, performers or types of music, furthermore, the records are arranged either alphabetically by the title or chronologically by the year of creation. Methods of creating a bibliography of a composer’s opus are presented for the first time resulting in guidelines for the organisation of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>descriptions</b> that will help bibliographers in their future endeavours. </p...|$|R
50|$|The International Standard <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Description</b> (ISBD) {{is a set}} {{of rules}} {{produced}} by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to create a <b>bibliographic</b> <b>description</b> in a standard, human-readable form, especially for use in a bibliography or a library catalog. A preliminary consolidated edition of the ISBD was published in 2007 and the consolidated edition was published in 2011, superseding earlier separate ISBDs for monographs, older monographic publications, cartographic materials, serials and other continuing resources, electronic resources, non-book materials, and printed music. IFLA's ISBD Review Group is responsible for maintaining the ISBD.|$|E

Two groups of students were involved: a control group, which was asked to provide <b>bibliographic</b> <b>descriptions</b> for nine types of conference proceedings using AACR 2 R; and an experimental group, which was asked to undertake similar tasks using CoPAS. Results indicated that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group. Results also indicated that text knowledge can be reinforced with the use of a computer assisted system, allowing students to perform significantly better in specific cataloguing tasks. Students with longer experience in computer use found it easier to master the use of the system as well as to comprehend the content and flow of information presented...|$|R

5000|$|Currently, most {{cataloging}} {{codes are}} similar to, or even based on, the International Standard <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Description</b> (ISBD), {{a set of}} rules produced by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to describe a wide range of library materials. These rules organize the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>description</b> of an item in the following eight areas: title and statement of responsibility (author or editor), edition, material specific details (for example, the scale of a map), publication and distribution, physical description (for example, number of pages), series, notes, and standard number (ISBN). There is an initiative called the Bibliographic Framework (Bibframe) that is [...] "an initiative to evolve <b>bibliographic</b> <b>description</b> standards to a linked data model, in order to make bibliographic information more useful both within and outside the library community." [...] The most commonly used cataloging code in the English-speaking world are the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition (AACR2). AACR2 provides rules for descriptive cataloging only and does not touch upon subject cataloging. AACR2 has been translated into many languages, for use around the world. The German-speaking world uses the Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung (RAK), also based on ISBD.|$|E
