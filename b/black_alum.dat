Their original internally heated retorts were not successful, but after restarting in 1935 {{with the local}} tunnel ovens, good yields of shale oil from the brown kukersite shale were achieved. The factory was destroyed by the Soviet occupation forces and rebuilt after WWII for uranium production from the local <b>black</b> <b>alum</b> (dictyonema) shale. Uranium production was soon replaced by uranium processing, but the factory (P. O. B. P- 6685) retained the old shale-related name. In 1970 tantalum, niobium and rare earths ’ production from the Khibina (Kola Peninsula, Lovozero) loparite ore was added and operated until {{the demise of the}} Soviet Union in the end of 1991. The uppermost layer in the tailings dump consists of thorium-rich loparite waste while the lowermost represents the black dictyonema shale processing waste, rich in uranium. We compare these two sources of radioactive pollution...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an innovative cement-electrolyte battery for low power operations such as cathodic protection of reinforced concrete. A battery design was refined by altering different constituents and examining the open circuit voltage, resistor loaded current and lifespan. The final design consisted of a copper plate cathode, aluminium plate anode, and a cement electrolyte which included additives of carbon <b>black,</b> plasticiser, <b>Alum</b> salt and Epsom salt. A relationship between age, temperature and hydration of the cell and the current it produced was determined. It was found that sealing the battery using varnish increased the moisture retention and current output. Current was also found to increase with internal temperature of the electrolyte and connecting two cells in parallel further doubled or even tripled the current. Parallel-connected cells could sustain an average current of 0. 35 mA through a 10 Ω resistor over two weeks of recording. The preliminary findings demonstrate that cement-based batteries can produce sufficient sustainable electrical outputs with the correct materials and arrangement of components. Work is ongoing to determine how these batteries can be recharged using photovoltaics which will further enhance their sustainability properties...|$|R

Ethnic Chinese businessmen began to visit Hội An from the 16th century onward and initially traded <b>black</b> incense, silk, <b>alum</b> and Chinese medicinal products {{with the local}} Vietnamese. Dutch, Portuguese and French businessmen who visited Hội An in the 17th century brought high quality brass utensils that {{attracted the attention of}} the Chinese. In turn, other goods such as porcelain, silver bars and various metals were traded. Around this time, the local Chinese community began to establish their own trading associations and social associations, the latter of which is referred to as bang in Vietnamese to protect their own economic interests. The bang also provided various welfare services for new Chinese immigrants, including financial services such as the collection of taxes. As more immigrants poured in the 19th century, the bang served as meeting points for Chinese community leaders together to pool seed capital to establish their own businesses. In 1906, Chinese and French businesspeople together had a total capital output of 222 million francs, compared to 2 million francs for the local Kinh Vietnamese.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{reports on}} {{expansive}} shales have received wide attention in recent decades. Damages and greater financial loss associated with expansive shale rocks {{have been documented}} in different countries. In Norway, challenges and problems in tunnels and underground excavations associated with the Upper Cambrian-Middle Ordovician <b>black</b> shale, <b>Alum</b> Shale, have been experienced since 1900 s. When evaluating various research reports on causes of concrete degradation through Alum Shale swelling, {{it is obvious that}} there is still the need to analyze further which minerals and mineral-related swelling processes are responsible in order to prevent harmful concrete compositions and to ensure safe and long-lasting structural integrity after construction work. In this pretext, an extensive laboratory work was undertaken to address {{the extent to which the}} mineralogy and swelling potential can be correlated, based on the hypothesis that gypsum influences the swelling property of the Alum Shale. In addition, possible effects of clay minerals and other unidentified mineral reactions on the swelling phenomenon were investigated. Fourteen samples, two of which are from a basement of an old building at Oslo city area (Møllergata) and twelve from the Gran Tunnel project site were studied. For each sample petrography and mineralogy were determined by optical microscopy, secondary electron microscope and X-ray diffraction and the swelling potential was obtained from free swelling and swelling pressure indices. Swelling potentials were obtained on seven samples with conventional and labour-intensive schemes determined by the free swelling index of rock powder submerged in water and swell measurements in response to consolidation, saturation, and rebound in an oedometer. The high pH value (low acidification), the low sulphur reactivity from pyrites and the absence of catalytic effect of pyrrhotite in pyrite oxidation showed how low the formation of gypsum could be in the shale. Gypsum was not detected in the 12 samples from Gran. The low amount of gypsum (about 1, 5 % and 2, 8 %) in samples from the Oslo city area showed the insignificant effect of swell in the Alum Shale. Rather, a fairly good positive correlation between measured illite/muscovite contents and swelling pressure was observed under these conditions...|$|R
25|$|Chinese {{economic}} {{dominance in}} Vietnam {{dates back to}} 208 B.C., when the renegade Qin Chinese general Zhao Tuo defeated An Dương Vương, the king of Âu Lạc in north Vietnam and conquered the Âu Lạc Kingdom, an ancient Vietnamese state situated in the northern mountains of modern Vietnam populated by the ancient Lạc Việt and Âu Việt. He annexed Âu Lạc into the Qin Empire the following year and declared himself the emperor of Nam Viet. A century later, the powerful Han dynasty annexed Nanyue into the Han Empire and was ruled as a province {{for the next several}} hundred years. Sinification of Nanyue was brought about by a combination of Han imperial military power, regular settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees, officers and garrisons, merchants, scholars, bureaucrats, fugitives, and prisoners of war. By the end of the 17th century, a distinct Chinese community, known as the Hoa, formed within Vietnamese society. Modern Chinese settlement and immigration in Vietnam came about from conducive opportunities for trade and business. Ethnic Chinese businessmen began to visit Hội An from the 16th century onward and initially traded <b>black</b> incense, silk, <b>alum</b> and Chinese medicinal products with the local Vietnamese.

40|$|Subaerial {{exposure}} and oxidation of organic carbon (Corg) -rich rocks {{is believed to}} be a key mechanism for the recycling of buried C and S back to Earth's surface. Importantly, processes coupled to microbial Corg oxidation are expected to shift new biomass d 13 Corg composition towards more negative values relative to source. However, there is scarcity of information directly relating rock chemistry to oxidative weathering and shifting d 13 Corg at the rock-atmosphere interface. This is particularly pertinent to the sulfidic, Corg-rich alum shale units of the Baltoscandian Basin believed to constitute a strong source of metal contaminants to the natural environment, following subaerial {{exposure and}} weathering. Consistent with independent support, we show that atmospheric oxidation of the sulfidic, Corg-rich alum shale sequence of the Cambrian-Devonian Baltoscandian Basin induces intense acid rock drainage at the expense of progressive oxidation of Fe sulfides. Sulfide oxidation takes priority over microbial organic matter decomposition, enabling quantitative massive erosion of Corg without producing a d 13 C shift between acid rock drainage precipitates and shale. Moreover, 13 C enrichment in inorganic carbon of precipitates does not support microbial Corg oxidation as the predominant mechanism of rock weathering upon exposure. Instead, a D 34 S ¼ d 34 Sshale � d 34 Sprecipitates z 0, accompanied by elevated S levels and the ubiquitous deposition of acid rock drainage sulfate minerals in deposited efflorescent precipitates relative to shales, provide strong evidence for quantitative mass oxidation of shale sulfide minerals as the source of acidity for chemical weathering. Slight d 15 N depletion in the new surface precipitates relative to shale, coincides with dramatic loss of N from shales. Collectively, the results point to pyrite oxidation as a major driver of <b>alum</b> <b>black</b> shale weathering at the rock-atmosphere interface, indicating that quantitative mass release of Corg, N, S, and key metals to the environment is a response to intense sulfide oxidation. Consequently, large-scale acidic weathering of the sulfide-rich alum shale units is suggested to influence the fate and redistribution of the isotopes of C, N, and S from shale to the immediate environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out for the (i) {{development}} of an inventory of the diseases of equines prevalent in three districts (Faisalabad, Sargodha and Lahore) of Punjab (Pakistan), with special emphasis on the parasitic diseases, and (ii) documentation of traditional veterinary medicine/practices (TVPs) in equines. The study {{was carried out}} in three districts (Faisalabad, Sargodha and Lahore) of Punjab-Pakistan. Survey was done with the help of Brooke Hospitals for Animals, Pakistan located at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF) -Pakistan. A total of 450 equine farmers constituted the key respondents for this study. One hundred and fifty respondents represented each of the three districts of Faisalabad, Sargodha and Lahore. Interviews, focused group discussions and field visits were conducted with the respondent. A total of 450 equines including 147 horses, 230 donkeys and 73 mules were subjected to clinical examination, blood examination and necropsy for the documentation of diseases/condition of equines in study area. A total of 53 diseases/conditions were documented in different species of equines in the study area. Internal parasites (32. 2 %) constituted the major category of ailments followed by wounds (26. 9 %), bacterial infections (20. 4 %), lameness (12. 9 %), miscellaneous (12. 7 %), gastrointestinal disorders (7. 6 %), bronchitis/cough (7. 3 %), allergic dermatitis (7. 1 %), external parasites (6. 2 %), colic (5. 3 %), eye problems (3. 1 %), hematuria (1. 8 %) and quidding (1. 1 %). Horses were most diversely affected (n= 47 / 53) followed by donkeys (n= 44 / 53) and mules (n= 24 / 53). A total of 60 plants and 44 materials other than plants were documented for their use in different diseases/conditions of equines. Maximum number of remedies/prescriptions was documented for the treatment of wounds (n= 57) followed by lameness (n= 40), bronchitis and colic (n= 21), anorexia (n= 19), dermatitis (n= 16), weakness (n= 13), internal parasites (n= 12), external parasites (n= 11), fever (n= 09), heat stress and retention of urine (n= 08), swelling and toxemeia (n= 07), indigestion (n= 06), diarrhea and pain (n= 05), haematuria (n= 04), quidding (n= 03), bad habits, eye problem and tetanus (n= 02). Similar trend was seen for the number of TVPs used for different diseases/conditions being highest (n= 121) for wounds and the lowest for tetanus (n= 02). The number of plants used for different diseases/conditions also varied being maximum for lameness (n= 21) followed by anorexia (n= 17), wounds (n= 16), weakness (n= 14), bronchitis (n= 12), fever and indigestion (n= 11). The maximum number of materials other than plants was used for wounds (n= 17) followed by lameness (n= 16) and colic (n= 12). Allium cepa, Zingiber officinale, Vernonia anthelmintica, Capsicum annum, Brassica campestris, and Trachyspermum ammi were the most diversely used plants. Twenty six of the 44 materials other than plants were used for the treatment of more than one disease/condition. Jaggery, water, common salt, <b>black</b> salt, <b>alum</b> stone and milk were the most diversely and frequently used materials other than plants. It is, recommended that (i) disease prevalence studies should be conducted on larger scale, (ii) documentation work may be expanded to other areas having rich cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge, (ii) all the plants used in TVPs may be subjected to standard scientific procedures for their validation, dose standardization and safety/toxicity studies, (iii) use of materials other than plants be rationalized and (iii) {{results of the present study}} should be shared with the equine owners and education/training programs on best equine husbandry practices be carried out...|$|R
