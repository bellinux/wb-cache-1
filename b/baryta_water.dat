50|$|The barium salt, as its hexahydrate, is {{very soluble}} in water (a {{distinction}} between phthalic and terephthalic acids). Uvitic acid, 5-methylisophthalic acid, is obtained by oxidizing mesitylene or by condensing pyroracemic acid with <b>baryta</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dihydroxymalonic acid can be {{obtained}} synthetically by hydrolysis of alloxan with <b>baryta</b> <b>water,</b> by warming caffuric acid with lead acetate solution, by electrolysis of tartaric acid in alkaline solution, or from glycerin diacetate and concentrated nitric acid in the cold. The product can {{be obtained}} also by oxidation of tartronic acid or glycerol.|$|E
