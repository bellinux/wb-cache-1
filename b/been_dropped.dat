5|$|Heskey was {{recalled}} {{into the}} England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan in 2005, after having <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> following the match against Ukraine in August 2004.

At the same time, the committee was given much broader powers. Hardboiled was sidelined by the new regime, and had <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> entirely from the LCS programme by the end of May.|$|E

Coinciding with her professional troubles was the collapse of her marriage to Harvey; Dixon filed for divorce just over a year after her wedding due to her husband's affair with Javine Hylton.|$|E

5|$|After {{successful}} athletics {{events at}} the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had {{either of the two}} larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would have ended up with a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1965 and November 1968, {{aircraft}} of the U.S. Air Force {{had flown}} 153,784 attack sorties against North Vietnam, while the Navy and Marine Corps had added another 152,399. On 31 December 1967, the Department of Defense announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs had <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> on North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped {{during the entire}} Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the line, {{supervised}} by Grainger & Miller, proved challenging, as a large-scale contracting industry {{was not yet}} in place in Scotland; nor was large-scale financing. At the end of 1838 Miller was instructed to build a branch from Barassie to Troon Harbour, earlier thoughts of taking over the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway and converting it—as it was then still a horse-operated plateway—having <b>been</b> <b>dropped.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coxon and Laker came to {{the crease}} {{and put on a}} 41-run stand for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson, ending his first Test innings for 19, and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> twice in the slips. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 207/9 with Bedser on six and Wright eight, having just avoided the follow on.|$|E
5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or charges have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 {{which were not}} pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{forming the}} New Radicals, lead singer Gregg Alexander {{released}} two solo albums, Michigan Rain (1989) and Intoxifornication (1992). Both albums were commercially unsuccessful, generating no charting singles and receiving mixed reviews from critics. Before forming the group, Alexander had <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> by two record labels: A and Epic Records. In 1997, Alexander signed to MCA Records and allegedly received a $600,000 advance.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{were unaware}} of this and mounted further attacks on the site {{as part of the}} United States Army Air Forces {{experimental}} Operation Aphrodite, involving radio-controlled B-24 Liberators packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.– the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy– was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end of the bombing campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs had <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the murder are sketchy. Carol was killed due to blunt trauma to her face by means of some instrument, alleged in court {{to have been an}} ice axe. She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown {{overboard}} from a boat on Coniston Water. The body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers. Had it <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> a few metres further from the shore, it would have sunk to the much deeper bottom and probably never have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|This {{was the end}} of U.S. air support, {{the last}} American {{aircraft}} departing Cambodian airspace on 15 August. From the beginning of Operation Breakfast the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia, 257,465 tons of which had <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> during the last six months of the operation. During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a nation that had once been the best fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|The Little Boy {{atomic bomb}} <b>was</b> <b>dropped</b> over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets {{recalled}} {{that the city}} was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the bomb <b>was</b> <b>dropped.</b>|$|R

5|$|Van der Aue {{worked on}} {{procedures}} for surface decompression and oxygen {{use in the}} early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times. He {{also found that the}} fast tissues which had <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced the fast compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had <b>been</b> <b>dropped.</b> The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. The {{omission}} generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased, feeling that Hutton was England's best batsman. Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett. England made three further changes. Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department. Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings, for the all rounder Loxton. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|After graduating a Bachelor of Arts, Tarr was {{articled}} to the solicitors firm of Owston, Dickinson, Simpson, and Bigg in Leicester, {{and also}} joined the Leicester Tigers, {{then as now}} {{considered one of the}} strongest clubs in the country. He scored 72 points in 94 appearances. In 1913, having <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> by England four years earlier, he was surprised to be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E
