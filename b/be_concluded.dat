5|$|Detailed {{planning}} and orders for Operation Trio were finalised {{at a conference}} in Ljubljana on 28–29 March 1942. Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the commander of the Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> with the Herzegovinian Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, but not with any of the Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who was aligned with the Serb collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E

The book cover was made of silver and decorated with the image of Jesus. It was made by Andrija Izat, who was a famous goldsmith from Kotor.|$|E
5|$|Let it not <b>be</b> <b>concluded,</b> that I wish {{to invert}} {{the order of}} things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E

5|$|As with Hergé's two {{previous}} stories, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls {{was designed as}} part of a twofold story arc, to <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> with the then yet unnamed Prisoners of the Sun. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy's curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. This {{was not the first time}} that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously done so when authoring Cigars of the Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Commander Matsumura Junzō {{arrived in}} London on 21 July and gave Reed the {{specifications}} for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, excluding armament, that exceeded {{the amount allocated}} in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart {{for a trip to}} Russia and the matter had to <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.|$|E

5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{signature}} of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement in 2001, Croatia applied for European Union (EU) membership in 2003, the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004, and the European Council granted candidate country status to Croatia in mid-2004. Accession negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, began in October of that year. Croatia completed the accession negotiations on 30 June 2011; on 9 December 2011 it signed the Treaty of Accession, changing its status from a candidate to an acceding country as it prepared to become the 28th EU member state. The ratification process by the Parliaments of all 27 current EU member states was expected to <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> {{by the end of}} June 2013, and Croatia's accession to the EU was expected to take place on 1 July 2013. In addition to ratification by the current EU member states, Article 142 of the Constitution of Croatia requires that a binding referendum be held on sovereignty issues such as Croatian EU membership.|$|E
5|$|If {{an offense}} is filed, the issue may be {{investigated}} by police on duty. Permission for {{search and seizure}} is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, the case may <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.|$|E
50|$|In Latin America, {{a series}} of {{regional}} sanitary conventions <b>were</b> <b>concluded.</b> Such a convention <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June 1904. A sanitary convention between the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> in Montevideo on 21 April 1914. The convention covers cases of Asiatic cholera, oriental plague and yellow fever. It was ratified by the Uruguayan government on 13 October 1914, by the Paraguayan government on 27 September 1917 and by the Brazilian government on 18 January 1921.|$|R

5|$|The {{conflict}} between the local kings of Thebes and the Hyksos king Apepi had started {{during the reign of}} Seqenenre Tao and would <b>be</b> <b>concluded,</b> after almost 30 years of intermittent conflict and war, under the reign of Ahmose I. Seqenenre Tao was possibly killed in a battle against the Hyksos, as his much-wounded mummy gruesomely suggests, and his successor Kamose (likely Ahmose's elder brother) is known to have attacked and raided the lands around the Hyksos capital, Avaris (modern Tell el-Dab'a). Kamose evidently had a short reign, as his highest attested regnal year is year 3, and was succeeded by Ahmose I. Apepi may have died near the same time. The two royal names—Awoserre and Aqenienre—known for Apepi attested in the historical record were for the same Hyksos king that were used by Ahmose's opponent at different times during the latter king's reign.|$|E
5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could <b>be</b> <b>concluded,</b> and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{arrival of}} aggressive new enemies– Turks {{in the east}} and Normans in the west– was another contributory factor. In 1040, the Normans, originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of plunder, began attacking Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy. In order to deal with them, a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable George Maniakes was sent to Italy in 1042. Maniakes and his army conducted a brutally successful campaign, but before it could <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> he was recalled to Constantinople. Angered by a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals, he was proclaimed emperor by his troops, and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army. However, a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards. With opposition thus absent in the Balkans, the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071.|$|E

50|$|The Treaty of Hanover <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> on 3 July 1710, {{during the}} Great Northern War. It allied the Russian Empire with Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover).

5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, so it can <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock Republican on October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.|$|E
5|$|This {{alliance}} probably forced Bolesław the Pious {{to reconsider}} his threatment of his nephew and finally granted him the Duchy of Poznań in 1273. Przemysł II, in exchange, not only interrupted {{for a time}} his cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, but decided to support his uncle in the expedition against Władysław of Opole (ally of King Ottokar II and Henryk IV Probus), {{in retaliation for the}} attempts of the Opole ruler to overthrow the government of Bolesław V the Chaste in Lesser Poland {{during the first half of}} 1273. Thus, with high probability it can <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that by this time the conflict between Przemysł II and his uncle for power has been finally resolved.|$|E
5|$|York {{picked up}} a third win in five matches by {{defeating}} Southend 2–1 at home with first half goals from Adam Reed and Blair. They remained in 20th position in the league following positive results {{for most of the}} teams surrounding them, meaning their relegation fight would not <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> until after the last match of the season. Before the Southend match Parslow was named Clubman of the Year, voted for by the York supporters, becoming the first player to win the award on three occasions. York avoided relegation {{on the final day of}} the season after beating Dagenham 1–0 away, with Chris Smith scoring the only goal. This meant York finished their first season back in the Football League in 17th place in League Two, four points clear of the relegation zone.|$|E
