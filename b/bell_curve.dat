25|$|Critics {{claimed that}} both the {{electrons}} and ion populations have <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> distribution; that the plasma is thermalized. The justification given is that the longer the electrons and ions move inside the polywell, the more interactions they undergo leading to thermalization. This model for the ion distribution is shown in Figure 5.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the <b>bell</b> <b>curve.</b> If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the <b>bell</b> <b>curve</b> as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E

25|$|As a {{thundercloud}} {{moves over}} the surface of the Earth, an equal electric charge, but of opposite polarity, is induced on the Earth's surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a <b>bell</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{score is}} {{calculated}} {{based on a}} <b>bell</b> <b>curve.</b> For example, if many do well in a paper, there is a potential reduction of the raw score and vice versa, despite differences in performances each year. For example, an average student would get a score of 210+ if he/she scored 3 low As and a high B. A highly proficient student would easily get a score of 250 and above if they scored 2 or 3 A*s and high As.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have {{increased}} {{in most parts of}} the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100. The phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test-takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule, IQ test scores have been rising at an average rate of around three IQ points per decade. This phenomenon was named the Flynn effect in the book The <b>Bell</b> <b>Curve</b> after James R. Flynn, the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bell</b> <b>curves</b> are {{applicable}} to understating many observations and measurements across the sciences. Relating Gaussian curves to data {{is a common}} because of its relation to both the Central Limit Theorem and to random error. Similarly, fitting logistic derivatives to oil or other nonrenewable resource production is common practice. Fitting <b>bell</b> <b>curves</b> to a time series is an inherently non-linear problem requiring initial estimates of the parameters describing the bellcurves. Poor estimates lead to instability and divergent solutions. Fitting to a cumulative curve improves stability, but {{at the expense of}} accuracy of the final solution. Jointly fitting multiple <b>bell</b> <b>curves</b> is superior to extraction of curves one at a time, but further exacerbates the non-linearity. Including both the cumulative data and the bell-curve data within the inversion, can exploit the greater stability of the cumulative fit and the greater accuracy of a direct fit. The algorithm presented here inverts for multiple bells by combining cumulative and direct fits to exploit the best features of both. The versatility and accuracy of the algorithm are demonstrated using two different Earth Science examples: a seismo-volcanic sequence recorded by a hydrophone array moored to the seafloor and U. S. coal production. The MatLab function used here for joint curve determination is included in the online manuscript complementary material...|$|R
25|$|The {{basic model}} assumes the {{observed}} HDR is the predicted HDR scaled by the weights for each event and then added, with noise mixed in. This generates {{a set of}} linear equations with more equations than unknowns. A linear equation has an exact solution, under most conditions, when equations and unknowns match. Hence one could choose any subset of the equations, with the number equal {{to the number of}} variables, and solve them. But, when these solutions are plugged into the left-out equations, there will be a mismatch between the right and left sides, the error. The GLM model attempts to find the scaling weights that minimize the sum of the squares of the error. This method is provably optimal if the error were distributed as a <b>bell</b> <b>curve,</b> and if the scaling-and-summing model were accurate. For a more mathematical description of the GLM model, see generalized linear models.|$|E

5000|$|What of {{the latest}} {{currents}} of thought? Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The indications are not all encouraging. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as Jensen and others had in the 1960s and 1970s. The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.Their general assertions about genes and IQ were not very controversial, but their speculations on race were something else again.By 1994, the time of The <b>Bell</b> <b>Curves</b> publishing, Jensen had received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund,an organization frequently described as racist and [...] "white supremacist" [...] in nature.The fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The <b>Bell</b> <b>Curves</b> most controversial chapter [...] "that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others" [...] with Jensens works being cited twenty-three times in the books bibliography.|$|R
