The differences in dose distribution were analyzed. The setup errors of three patients who were irradiated in the neck, esophagus, and pelvic area were obtained retrospectively. We found that the maximum dose variances for the three cases were 19. 9 - 35. 9 %. The maximum dose variance points were relatively far from the isocenter.

PD of 6 MV Siemens Primus linear accelerator photon beam for 10 cm square field and 2. 5 cm diameter cone were measured at 1. 5 cm and 10 cm depth, 100 cm source surface distance (SSD) with Kodak EDR 2 film. PD for 10 cm square field and 2. 5 cm cone were measured for the distance 1 cm to 5 cm from the geometric field edge. PD was calculated as a percentage of the central axis dose. The PD for both field sizes decreased with increasing distance from the <b>beam</b> <b>edge.</b> PD was also larger for 10 cm square field compared to 2. 5 cm circular field for both depths. At 10 cm depth, the measured PD was 20 % and 10 % higher compared to that of 1. 5 cm depth for 10 cm and 2. 5 cm field size respectively. The PD for a given beam energy is a function of distance from the <b>beam</b> <b>edge,</b> field size and depth. At any depth measured, PD increases as the field size increases due to radiation scattered from the beam and scatter arising from within the medium. At deeper depth, more Compton electrons are produced and scattered to the peripheral region hence causes the PD to increase with depth. At any field size measured, peripheral dose increases as the depth increases. PD also increases as the field size increases...|$|E

When <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> were not used, deflections were increased substantially, and local fluctuation of stress {{in the vicinity of}} the supports was intensified. Such behaviors were aggravated when RSR was low and proper constraints against the lateral support movement were not provided, thus resulting in inefficient systems.

It is located in road environment and therefore exposed to water and salt with chlorides as well as subject to impacts during accidents. It deteriorates in a greater pace {{than the rest of the}} bridge and therefore has a shorter lifespan than the bridge in full. A deteriorated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> put the safety of the bridge users in jeopardize and increases the need of maintenance, repair and replacement work. These activities affect the surrounding traffic flow due to reduced speed limits as well as closure of traffic lanes. A literature study has been performed to get an understanding of how <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> are designed and constructed. A great part of this was done by examining codes and regulations. By meeting engineers from different building companies it has been possible to obtain a picture of how it is done in real life and how the path to the final design looks like. Building site visits were carried out to see the process from design to construction i. e. how it is applied in real life. A design study was performed, including a check of crack width in an integrated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> over a support, height of bridge deck when a pre-fabricated (brokappa) is used and a comparison in the magnitude of the clamping moment in a steel-concrete bridge with and without an <b>edge</b> <b>beam.</b> All proposals are presented by the <b>Edge</b> <b>Beam</b> Group (EBG, in Swedish, Kantbalksgruppen), which is composed of experienced engineers that works within the frame of the project social optimal <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> systems governed by the Swedish Transport Administration. The literature research showed that even if the edge bean is prone to deteriorate its lifespan does not have to be governed by its condition. Planned expansion of bridge width and maintenance strategies including the replacement of waterproofing layer could also be a reason for replacement in some cases. A significant increase of reinforcement in the <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> and top part of the bridge deck over support is needed to obtain an acceptable crack width of 0. 15 mm. This would however aggravate the casting phase. The use of a pre-fabricated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> result in an increase of the bridge deck height. A solution could be to strengthen the anchoring capacity but this could in turn give an over reinforced structure. When it comes to the clamping moment in a steelconcrete composite bridge the integrated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> leads to a better distribution of the traffic load.

The study was performed on SPM and VUCLAN, which is a non-linear finite element program that includes both thermal and structural analysis. The effect of various edge continuity conditions on the basic slab panel was assessed by VULCAN models and compared with SPM. 9 m x 9 m slab panel were firstly investigated, then 9 m x 6 m and 9 m x 12 m slab panels were modelled to investigate the effect of aspect ratio on SPM’s provisions. The VULCAN analyses showed that the slab panels perform better with more internal <b>edges</b> and <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> deformations are always critical to the fire resistance of the slab panels. The SPM and VULCAN deflections were in good agreement in the 9 m x 9 m slab panel, but it underestimates the deflections of 9 m × 6 m slab panel and was slightly conservative on the 9 m × 12 m slab panel.
