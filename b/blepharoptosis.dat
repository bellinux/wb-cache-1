50|$|Lenz {{microphthalmia}} syndrome (or LMS) is a {{very rare}} inherited disorder characterized by abnormal smallness of one or both eyes (microphthalmos) sometimes with droopy eyelids (<b>blepharoptosis),</b> resulting in visual impairment or blindness. Eye problems may include coloboma, microcornea, and glaucoma. Some affected infants may have complete absence of the eyes (anophthalmia). Most affected infants have developmental delay and intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Other physical abnormalities associated with this disorder can include an unusually small head (microcephaly), and malformations of the teeth, ears, fingers or toes, skeleton, and genitourinary system. The range and severity of findings vary from case to case. Formal diagnosis criteria do not exist.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} various surgical techniques for correcting different types of senile <b>blepharoptosis.</b> METHODS: From June 2008 to October 2011, 150 cases(164 eyes) patients with senile <b>blepharoptosis</b> underwent surgical treatment. Patients with severe <b>blepharoptosis</b> received frontalis muscle flap suspensio, patients with moderate <b>blepharoptosis</b> get levator palpebrae superioris muscle shortening and those with mild <b>blepharoptosis</b> underwent pleating of levator palpebrae superioris. RESULTS: After 3 -month to 1 -year follow-up, 154 (93. 9 %) eyes get satisfactory results and 10 (6. 1 %) eyes obtained better results. CONCLUSION: In order to achieve the best correction in patients with <b>blepharoptosis,</b> {{it is important that}} making objective and careful preoperative examinations, selecting appropriate operation managements according to the levator palpebrae superioris muscle strength, the degrees of <b>blepharoptosis</b> and combined with experience...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{study the}} metrics of lid saccades in <b>blepharoptosis</b> and to {{distinguish}} any {{differences in the}} dynamics of eyelid movements {{that are related to}} the cause of <b>blepharoptosis</b> and to aging. METHODS. The lid and vertical eye saccades of 7 patients with congenital <b>blepharoptosis</b> and those of 18 patients with aponeurogenic <b>blepharoptosis,</b> either involutional or rigid-contact-lens-induced, were recorded with electromagnetic search coils. For each saccade, two parameters were assessed: amplitude and peak velocity. Two age-matched control groups were assessed in the same manner. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to investigate any observed differences between the included groups. RESULTS. Congenital and rigid-contact-lens-induced <b>blepharoptosis</b> were readily distinguishable from one another, {{as well as from the}} age-matched control group, in both lid saccadic amplitude and peak velocity. For example, 40 degrees downward lid saccades in the congenital <b>blepharoptosis</b> group averaged 22. 9 degrees +/- 4. 0 degrees (SD), whereas 30. 0 degrees +/- 4. 7 degrees lid saccades were made by the age-matched control group. The subjects in the two groups with aponeurogenic <b>blepharoptosis</b> also made lid saccades that were distinctive for their group (P: 0. 05) in saccadic amplitude and peak velocity to those of age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS. In different forms of <b>blepharoptosis,</b> distinctive metrics of lid saccades occur. The current data suggest that involutional <b>blepharoptosis</b> is not a consequence of normal age-related changes in eyelid function...|$|E

This cross-sectional study was based on data obtained in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2010 to 2012. In total, 17, 178 Korean adults (7, 261 men and 9, 917 women) aged 19 years or older were enrolled. <b>Blepharoptosis</b> {{was defined as a}} marginal reflex distance 1 (MDR 1) lower than 2 mm. Household income and education level were used as indicators of SES. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the relationship between SES and the prevalence of <b>blepharoptosis.</b> Household income was inversely associated with the prevalence of <b>blepharoptosis</b> in women [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was 1. 894 (1. 336, 2. 685) ], and educational level was inversely associated with <b>blepharoptosis</b> in both men and women [aORs and 95 % CIs were 1. 572 (1. 113, 2. 219) and 1. 973 (1. 153, 3. 376), respectively].

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{aimed to}} report our {{successful}} use of frontalis muscle flap suspension for the correction of congenital <b>blepharoptosis</b> in early age children. METHODS: This retrospective study included 61 early age children (41 boys, 20 girls) {{with an average}} age of 6 years (range, 3 - 10 years) with congenital <b>blepharoptosis</b> who received surgery during the period from March 2007 to January 2011. There were 39 cases of unilateral <b>blepharoptosis</b> and 22 cases of bilateral <b>blepharoptosis,</b> thus a total of 83 eyes were affected. If patient had bilateral <b>blepharoptosis,</b> both eyes were operated on in the same surgery. Patients were followed for 3 months to 5 years. The procedure was performed without complications in all cases. RESULTS: The postoperative healing grade was good in 81 eyes (97. 6 %); the correction of <b>blepharoptosis</b> was satisfactory, the double eyelid folds were natural and aesthetic, the eyelid position and the curvature were ideal, and the eyes were bilaterally symmetrical. The postoperative healing grade was fair in 2 eyes (2. 4 %); <b>blepharoptosis</b> was improved compared with that before surgery. At discharge, lagophthalmos was noted in 10 eyes of which 4 cases resolved by the last follow-up. The remaining 6 cases were mild. Eleven eyes received reoperation for residual ptosis after the first surgery. The curvature of the palpebral margin was not natural in 4 eyes. These unnatural curvature possibly was caused by an excessively low lateral fixation point or postoperative avulsion. CONCLUSION: Frontalis muscle flap suspension under general anesthesia for the correction of congenital <b>blepharoptosis</b> in early age children can achieve good surgical results...|$|E

40|$|To examine obesity {{parameters}} {{as potential}} risk {{factors associated with}} <b>blepharoptosis</b> in a representative Korean population. We analyzed the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), conducted between 2008 and 2010. 10, 285 Korean adults (4, 441 men and 5, 844 women) aged 40 years or older was enrolled. We compared body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and percentage body fat (BF), according to the severity of <b>blepharoptosis.</b> Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations of each obesity parameter with <b>blepharoptosis.</b> The overall prevalence of age-related <b>blepharoptosis</b> was 14. 8 % in South Korea. There were significant and graded associations between increasing <b>blepharoptosis</b> severity and the mean value of obesity parameters (P for trend < 0. 05). As marginal reflex distance 1 (MRD 1) decreased, the prevalence of general obesity and overweight status increased (P for trend= 0. 121 in men and < 0. 001 in women); the prevalence of abdominal obesity increased (P for trend < 0. 001 for both genders); the prevalence of highest quartile of percentage BF increased (P for trend ≤ 0. 001 for both genders). <b>Blepharoptosis</b> {{was significantly associated with}} general obesity in women (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 2. 14; 95 % confidence intervals (CI), 1. 32 - 3. 47); and with the highest quartile of percentage BF in men (aOR, 2. 01; 95 % CI, 1. 34 - 2. 97) and in women (aOR, 1. 52; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 2. 3317, after adjusting for age, smoking exercise, drinking alcohol, total energy intake, fat intake, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, and family history of eye disease. The etiology of age-related <b>blepharoptosis</b> may be multifactorial and is unclear.

The present study aims to introduce our surgical criteria, surgical options, outcomes, and precautions for medically refractory myasthenic <b>blepharoptosis.</b> Patients and methods: Eight patients who {{failed to respond to}} at least 2 years of medical treatment and who underwent <b>blepharoptosis</b> surgery, from January 2008 to December 2011, were enrolled in this study. Medical records, photographs, and questionnaire results regarding postoperative status were evaluated. Of the eleven procedures performed, four involved frontal suspension, four involved external levator advancement, one involved nonincisional transconjunctival levator advancement, and two involved subbrow blepharoplasty with orbicularis oculi muscle tucking. The margin reflex distance improved postoperatively in seven patients. Results: Seven patients had very minimal scarring, and one had minimal scarring. Five patients showed no eyelid asymmetry, one had subtle asymmetry, and two had obvious asymmetry. Seven patients were very satisfied, and one patient was satisfied with the overall result.

Methods: A series of lower eyelid movements during eye closing in intraoperative quantification of <b>blepharoptosis</b> surgery were examined in 30 eyelids of 15 patients (6 males and 9 females; mean age 70. 0 years; range 43 &ndash; 81 years) with bilateral aponeurotic <b>blepharoptosis.</b> Results: Inferior {{displacement of the}} lower eyelid was observed in all eyelids examined, although the extent varied in each patient (range 2. 0 &ndash; 4. 5 mm; mean 3. 2 mm). Inferior displacement occurred with upward eye movement caused by Bell&# 39;s phenomenon. Many wrinkles were simultaneously observed {{as a result of}} contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle. After maintaining the inferiorly displaced state for several seconds, 20 lower eyelids in 10 patients naturally moved superiorly to a resting position. On the other hand, 10 lower eyelids in 5 patients remained in the same inferior position for more than 5 seconds, after which we had to manually elevate them to a resting position. The eyes then moved inferiorly to their resting position with a {{decrease in the number of}} lower eyelid wrinkles. Once the patients opened their eyes, inferior displacement of the lower eyelid completely disappeared.

40|$|For <b>blepharoptosis</b> repair, {{typically}} a long skin incision is made along the upper eyelid crease, the orbital septum is opened, a dissection is made until the levator aponeu-rosis is found under the preaponeurotic fat pad, and the levator aponeurosis is sutured to the tarsus at three differ-ent positions [1]. However, in 1999, Lucarelli and Lemke [2] {{introduced a new}} surgical technique, which enables <b>blepharoptosis</b> repair in patients who had <b>blepharoptosis</b> without dermatochalasis, with an 8 to 10 mm skin incision, exposing the tarsus through the incision and suturing the levator aponeurosis to the tarsus at just one position.

A good outcome can be also obtained in cases with poor levator function, however, in such cases; a large degree of levator advancement may be required, which may result in postoperative dry eyes, unnatural eyelid curvature and astigmatism. These cases are therefore better treated with sling surgery. With the right patient selection, the levator resection technique is an effective method for ptosis repair...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the results of}} surgical correction of <b>blepharoptosis</b> {{in a series of}} patients with myasthenia gravis. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients with myasthenia gravis who underwent surgical correction for <b>blepharoptosis</b> at the Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1999. The primary outcome measure was change in interpalpebral eyelid fissure height. RESULTS: Eighteen <b>blepharoptosis</b> procedures were performed on 11 patients with myasthenia gravis. Eight of the 11 patients had ocular myasthenia gravis, and 3 had systemic myasthenia gravis. Of the 18 procedures performed, 11 were external levator advancements (ELA), 6 were frontalis slings, and 1 was a tarsomyectomy. Patients were followed up postoperatively for an average of 34 months (range, 9 to 126 months). The amount of ptosis was quantified preoperatively and postoperatively for 9 of the 11 eyelids that underwent ELA. For these eyelids, there was a statistically significant improvement in the mean interpalpebral eyelid fissure height, from 4. 2 mm preoperatively to 8. 1 mm postoperatively, with a mean difference of 3. 9 mm (95 % confidence interval, 2. 3 to 5. 5 mm; P =. 0005). Postoperative complications included worsened diplopia in 1 patient who underwent ELA and exposure keratopathy in 1 patient who underwent a frontalis sling procedure. Two of the eyelids that underwent ELA developed recurrent ptosis, requiring additional surgery more than 2 years after the initial procedure. CONCLUSION: Surgical correction of <b>blepharoptosis</b> is an appropriate treatment option in patients with myasthenia gravis who fail medical therapy. Potential complications include worsened diplopia and exposure keratopathy...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{fibrosis}} of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) {{is a rare}} disorder {{characterized by}} hereditary non-progressive restrictive strabismus and <b>blepharoptosis.</b> Although {{most of the cases}} are bilateral and isolated, some patients may have systemic findings. CFEOM is divided into three groups as CFEOM 1, 2, and 3 according to the phenotype. Primary responsible genes are KIF 21 A for CFEOM type 1 and 3 and PHOX 2 A/ARIX gene for CFEOM type 2. Studies suggest that abnormal innervation of the extraocular muscles is the cause of muscle fibrosis. Early treatment is important because of the risk of amblyopia. Surgery is the primary treatment option for strabismus and <b>blepharoptosis.</b> (Turk J Ophthalmol 2014; 44 : 312 - 5...|$|E
