50|$|Like {{all other}} class I {{antiarrhythmic}} agents, quinidine primarily works by <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> fast inward sodium current (INa).

This means at higher heart rates, <b>the</b> <b>block</b> increases, while at lower heart rates, <b>the</b> <b>block</b> decreases. <b>The</b> effect of <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax).|$|R

5|$|Several {{types of}} RNA can {{downregulate}} gene expression by being complementary to {{a part of}} an mRNA or a gene's DNA. MicroRNAs (miRNA; 21-22nt) are found in eukaryotes and act through RNA interference (RNAi), where an effector complex of miRNA and enzymes can cleave complementary mRNA, <b>block</b> <b>the</b> mRNA from being translated, or accelerate its degradation.|$|E
5|$|Sponges' cells absorb oxygen by {{diffusion}} {{from water}} into cells as water flows through body, into which {{carbon dioxide and}} other soluble waste products such as ammonia also diffuse.

5|$|The Persian {{invasion}} was {{a delayed}} {{response to the}} defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece, which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. King Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles proposed that the Allied Greeks <b>block</b> <b>the</b> advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae and simultaneously <b>block</b> <b>the</b> Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium. An Allied naval force of 271 triremes was thus dispatched to await the arrival of the Persians.|$|E

5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} <b>block</b> <b>the</b> ball with either their hands or arms.

5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could <b>block</b> <b>the</b> straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E

These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington Supreme Court. Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the state of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes.
