40|$|Winter {{squash and}} pumpkin growers in the Northeast are seeking {{production}} {{systems that are}} more costeffective than those they are currently using. An intensive plasticulture system that utilizes transplants and high plant populations, plastic mulch and drip irrigation, scouting, and as-needed fertilizer and pesticide applications is consistent with this objective because it results in greatly increased yields of marketable fruit. This system increases certain inputs – plant numbers and agricultural plastics, most notably – {{in order to increase}} marketable yields per acre. At the same time, other inputs – including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers – may be reduced. Three field trials were undertaken in 2003 to evaluate various aspects of the plasticulture system: pumpkin fertigation treatments were evaluated at Al Lansing’s farm in Albany County, and winter squash fertigation and pumpkin and winter squash disease management treatments were evaluated at Cornell’s Valatie farm in Columbia County. At the Lansing farm we evaluated the impact of four nitrogen fertigation rates – 50, 65, 80, and 95 lb N/acre - on pumpkin yields. The number of pumpkins increased with increasing fertilizer rates. At the Valatie farm we evaluated how four rates of nitrogen fertilizer – 30, 45, 60 and 75 lb N/acre - affected the yields of acorn and <b>butternut</b> <b>squashes.</b> The squashes exhibited yield responses only at the highest N rate. Average fruit size was not impacted by these treatments. New, powdery mildew tolerant varieties of squash out-yielded standard varieties even when the newer varieties were given the lowest rates of N and the standards were given the highest N rates. These studies suggest that high yields of acorn and <b>butternut</b> <b>squashes</b> grown using plasticulture techniques may be obtained by selecting good varieties, using high plant populations, and by choosing modest fertilizer rates. In another trial at the Valatie farm we intended to find out how three disease management strategies affected disease incidence, fruit yield, and fruit quality in pumpkins and acorn and <b>butternut</b> <b>squashes.</b> Heavy rains just prior to harvest followed by a rapid Phytophthora infestation destroyed the entire trial making data collection impossible. We expect to repeat this work in 2004...|$|R

Apples from New England include the traditional varieties Baldwin, Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise, Porter, Roxbury Russet, Wright, Sops of Wine, Hightop Sweet, Peck's Pleasant, Titus Pippin, Westfield-Seek-No-Further, and Duchess of Oldenburg. Beach plums a small native species with fruits {{the size of a}} pinball, are sought after in summer to make into a jam. Cranberries are another fruit indigenous to the region, often collected in autumn in huge flooded bogs. Thereafter they are juiced so they can be drunk fresh for breakfast, or dried and incorporated into salads. Winter squashes like pumpkin and <b>butternut</b> <b>squashes</b> have been a staple for generations owing to their ability to keep for long periods over icy New England winters and being an excellent source of beta carotene; in summer, they are replaced with pattypan and zucchini, the latter brought to the region by immigrants from Southern Italy a century ago. Blueberries are a very common summertime treat owing to them being an important crop, and find their way into muffins, pies and pancakes. Typical favorite desserts are quite diverse, and encompass hasty pudding, blueberry pie, whoopie pies, Boston cream pie, pumpkin pie, Joe Frogger cookies, hand crafted ice cream, Hermit cookies, and most famous of all, the chocolate chip cookie, invented in Massachusetts in the 1930s.|$|R
