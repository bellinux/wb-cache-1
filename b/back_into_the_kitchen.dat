25|$|A {{man came}} in before I left, who I {{found out later}} was Baby Face Nelson. He {{came in with a}} drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{additional}} {{scene with}} Donna [...] {{was cut from}} the final episode: [...] "There was an additional Donna bit after this goodbye from the Doctor, which is when he goes outside into the TARDIS, we cut <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and there's a moment where Donna hears the TARDIS... there's a moment of realisation, and then she turns back round and carries on talking into the phone." [...] Gardner considered this scene untruthful and too confusing, since Donna remembering would lead to her death, and since she didn't recognise the Doctor it wouldn't make sense to assume she would recognise {{the noise of the}} TARDIS.|$|E
60|$|Then Clemantiny went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and cried--good, rough-spoken, tender-hearted Clemantiny {{sat down}} and cried.|$|E
60|$|The dog, {{bored by}} the inaction, had wandered <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>kitchen</b> and resumed his broken slumber. One of the tramps {{was leaning against}} the wall talking with the farmer woman. The other was busily engaged in {{scratching}} his right shin with what remained of the heel of his left shoe. He supported himself with one hand on a small table upon the top of which was a family Bible.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I find Andy and Randy {{have been}} up to another trick {{right on top of}} this water-hose nonsense, I'll give them a tanning they won't forget in a hurry," [...] added Tom Rover; and then he and Sam {{followed}} Dick up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> porch and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R
60|$|Phonny hastened {{along to}} the house. From the yard he went into a shed through a great door. He walked along the {{platform}} in the shed, {{and at the end}} of the platform he went up three steps, to a door leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>kitchen.</b> He passed through this <b>back</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>kitchen,</b> hurrying forward as he went, and leaving all the doors open.|$|R
6000|$|Rachel went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where Eliza was sewing, and, {{opening the}} door of a small bedroom, said gently, 'Come in here with me, my daughter; I have news to tell thee.' ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the men all {{streamed}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Then the master of the house, Alday, his face on fire with emotion, thrust himself into the midst of the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|She follows {{into the}} bedroom. The maid ANNIE puts {{her head out}} of [...] the kitchen door; she comes out a step as if to fly; then, at [...] BUILDER'S voice, shrinks <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
40|$|Management {{of color}} quality goes beyond just {{measuring}} product {{as it comes}} off the press line. Information about corrections made on press can be fed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ink <b>kitchen</b> and pre-press workflow. This provides an opportunity to help reduce makeready times for future similar press runs. Inline color measurement {{is part of a}} broader quality control workflow that allows the printer to understand the intricate relationships between inks (color, viscosity, temperature, pH, etc.) and press conditions (including pressure, run speed, anilox or cylinder engraving conditions, etc.). Thoroughly understanding these relationships, and how they affect the quality and efficiency of a print run, is key to optimizing the printing process and maximizing bottom line performance...|$|R
60|$|She passed away, and Hamel {{watched her}} {{disappear}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Then he dragged out {{a bowl of}} tobacco and filled a pipe. Although he was half ashamed of himself, he strolled <b>back</b> once more <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and, drawing up a stool, he sat down just where he had discovered Hannah Cox, sat still and listened. No sound of any sort reached him. He sat there for ten minutes. Then he scrambled to his feet.|$|R
5000|$|After an {{explosive}} argument where Tony yells at Christopher and Brendan Filone about their successful hijacking of a Comley Trucking transport truck, a trucking company that operates under the [...] "protection" [...] of Tony's uncle Corrado Soprano, Brendan {{is picked up}} and thrown out of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> room and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> where he rolls over a table of fresh meat chops. He made the statement that Tony is really boss of the family since Jackie Aprile Sr. became the [...] "Chemo"sabe, a reference to Jackie's cancer. This greatly angers Tony.|$|R
6000|$|... "You foolee Hop Lung! You foolee Hop Lung!" [...] he shrieked wildly, and of {{a sudden}} came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> scooped up several of the fish, and ran outside again. Wildly he threw one fish after another at the lads.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{pleasure}} {{to return to the}} barnyard, to get <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> where her aunt was phlegmatically working away at supper-getting. She wiped her hands on her apron, and said [...] "How-de-do!" [...] as if Rose were a neighbor just dropping in for a call.|$|E
60|$|Hop Lung looked {{carefully}} {{around the}} yard and then came slowly <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> He walked again to the stove to see that nothing was burning, and finally {{came back to the}} cabinet and picked up the two fish gingerly. Meanwhile, the boys tiptoed their way back to their original positions at the windows.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inner room, and saw {{the bits}} of pots and things on the floor, and then I came <b>back</b> with White <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> girl Rose had come <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> during our absence. She was {{standing}} with {{her back against the}} bin near the fire. There was a cup standing on the bin, rather nearer the door. She said to me, [...] "Cup'll go soon; it has been down three times already." [...] She then pushed it a little farther on the bin, and turned round and stood talking to me by the fire. She had hardly done so, when the cup jumped up suddenly about four or five feet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, and then fell on the floor and smashed itself. White was sitting {{on the other side of}} the fire.|$|R
60|$|He {{packed his}} father <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shop, {{and his mother}} down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to get his tea, {{and for a while}} we sat {{together}} talking.|$|R
60|$|But Lise, {{suddenly}} {{bursting into}} tears, {{got up and}} left the room. Edward picked up the Banner and pretended to read it, while Janet collected the salt and put it <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shaker. Hannah, gathering up the rest of <b>the</b> dishes, disappeared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> but presently returned, as though she had forgotten something.|$|R
60|$|She went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{and sang}} blithely as she bustled over the {{preparations}} for tea. Her voice was feeble, {{but there was}} a triumphant effectiveness about the high notes which perplexed the listener sorely. He seated himself in the new easy-chair--procured to satisfy the supposed aesthetic tastes of Miss Robinson--and stared at the window.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dorcas {{had ceased}} to call for him, when he {{understood}} {{that it would be}} more prudent on his part to secure a light before taking any steps to fetter the burglar, and he stepped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> for this purpose; but he had not yet found a match when the little woman entered, holding high above her head a lamp, as she had done on the night when Joe first saw her.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} get this out of my head; but though I took down many {{interesting}} authors, old and new, history, poetry, and story-book, this notion of my father's hand of writing stuck to me; and when at length I went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and sat down once more to porridge and small beer, the first thing I said to Uncle Ebenezer was to ask him if my father had not been very quick at his book.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] said Grace. She turned <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house, {{and then}} she came running out again; but by this time Barlow had gone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where she heard him telling the cook that these were {{the last of the}} dommyneckers. At breakfast several of the ladies came and asked after Mrs. Maynard, whose restless night they had somehow heard of. When she came out of the dining-room' Miss Gleason waylaid her in the hall.|$|R
5000|$|Introducing new tools, {{ingredients}} and methods <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> ...|$|R
60|$|She makes {{a little}} curtsey and passes through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{came up to}} her, his red face, {{with its}} bloodshot eyes, thrust forward, and gripped her arms. She cried in fear of him, {{struggled}} to be free. Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushed her roughly to the outer door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt behind her with a bang. Then he went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> dropped into his armchair, his head, bursting full of blood, sinking between his knees. Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} nothing. I can't help any young man. He is only over {{there because of}} the brewery." [...] She had told all her secret now. [...] "He is nothing to me, Herr Steinmarc, and {{if you choose to}} tell aunt Charlotte, you must. I shall tell aunt Charlotte that if she will let me keep out of your way, I will promise to keep out of his. But if you come, then--then--then--I don't know what I may do." [...] After that she escaped, and went away <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> while Peter Steinmarc stumped up again to his own room.|$|E
60|$|But my escapade {{was brief}} and humiliating. The {{shock of the}} cold, the excitement, quickly {{exhausted}} me. I threw myself down and covered my face with my hands, trying in vain to stifle my sobs. What was my longing? Where its satisfaction? Soft as wool a drowsiness stole over my senses that might swiftly have wafted me off on the last voyage of discovery. But I had been missed. A few minutes' search, and Pollie discovered me lying there by the frozen cabbage stalks. The woeful Mænad was carried <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> again--a hot bath, a hot posset, and a few anxious and thankful tears.|$|E
60|$|She went downstairs. She {{could not}} {{understand}} the multiplied running of water. Stepping down <b>the</b> step <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> she put her foot <b>into</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> was flooded. Where did it come from? She {{could not understand}}.|$|R
60|$|She neither answered, nor looked back--she went her way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R
60|$|In three strides {{he was at}} <b>the</b> {{door leading}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The boy {{took the}} flat-iron {{and went to}} work," [...] {{continued}} Wallace. [...] "Presently, however, {{he thought he would}} go out into the shed and see if the snow had blown in, during the night. He found that it had, and so he stopped to play with the drift a few minutes. At last he came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and he found, when he came in, that Dorothy had finished ironing his towel and had put it away. He began to complain of her for doing this, and then, in order to punish her, as he said, he took two of her flat-irons and ran off with them, and put them into the snow drift." ...|$|E
6000|$|She goes {{across to}} the bedroom on the Right, and soon returns with a [...] suit of pyjamas, a toothbrush, a pair of {{slippers}} and a case of [...] razors, which she puts on the table, and disappears into the [...] kitchen. She reappears with a bread pan, which she deposits in the [...] centre of the room; then crosses again to the bedroom, and once more [...] reappears with a clothes brush, two hair brushes, and a Norfolk [...] jacket. As she stuffs all these into the bread pan and bears it [...] <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> there {{is the sound of}} a car driving up and [...] stopping. ANNIE reappears at the kitchen door just as the knocker [...] sounds.|$|E
6000|$|Now again, let the reader, {{bearing in}} mind that General Adams has {{unequivocally}} said, {{in one part of}} his address, that the charge in relation to the assignment was manufactured just before the election, turn to the affidavit of Peter S. Weber, where the following will be found viz.: [...] "I, Peter S. Weber, do certify that from the best of my recollection, on the day or day after Gen. Adams started for the Illinois Rapids, in May last, that I was at the house of Gen. Adams, sitting in the kitchen, situated on the back part of the house, it being in the afternoon, and that Benjamin Talbott came around the house, <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and appeared wild and confused, and that he laid a package of papers on the kitchen table and requested that they should be handed to Lucian. He made no apology for coming to the kitchen, nor for not handing them to Lucian himself, but showed the token of being frightened and confused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause I could not apprehend." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Taylor sat down, {{looking away from}} her.|$|R
60|$|He {{carried a}} copy out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and {{presented}} it to Maria.|$|R
