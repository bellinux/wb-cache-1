In 1888 there was a surplus on operating account of £5,750, {{but all of the}} [...] "profit" [...] was eaten up immediately by backlogs of rent and interest charges; the backlog continued to increase. However in 1889 the Regulation of Railways Act was passed, requiring the installation of <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>interlocking</b> of points and signals, and continuous brakes on passenger trains; all of this would cost money that the M&MR did not have.|$|R

50|$|Toronto subway {{signals are}} {{a system of}} light-based {{indicators}} to give instructions to trains on Line 1 Yonge-University, Line 2 Bloor-Danforth and Line 4 Sheppard of the Toronto subway system, operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). It uses <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> and <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals.</b> The TTC uses the NX/UR system of signalling, which is also used in New York on the New York City Subway, in Chicago on the 'L', and in Boston on the MBTA.|$|R
50|$|A {{distant signal}} {{can either be}} an {{automatic}} <b>signal</b> before an <b>interlocking,</b> or the <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> itself when interlockings are back to back. Distant signals typically display more aspects than a typical <b>block</b> or <b>interlocking</b> <b>signal</b> to warn trains of diverging movements at the next interlocking however {{this is not always}} the case if there are no diverging paths available.|$|R
50|$|Trains on the Main Line between Long Island City and Ronkonkoma {{are governed}} by Automatic <b>Block</b> and <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Signals</b> and by Automatic Train Control (known as Automatic Speed Control by the LIRR). East of Ronkonkoma to Greenport trains operate in non-signaled dark territory, with all train {{movements}} being governed by train orders and timetable authority.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{traffic density}} {{warranted}} it, multiple tracks could be provided, {{each with a}} timetable-defined flow of traffic which would {{eliminate the need for}} frequent single track-style [...] "meets." [...] Trains running counter to this flow of traffic would still require train orders, but other trains would not. This system was further automated by the use of Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>Signaling</b> and <b>interlocking</b> towers which allowed for efficient and failsafe setting of conflicting routes at junctions and that kept trains following one another safely separated. However any track that supported trains running bi-directionally, even under ABS protection, would require further protection to avoid the situation of two trains approaching each other on the same section of track. Such a Mexican standoff not only represents a safety hazard, but also would require one train to reverse direction to the nearest passing point.|$|R
50|$|The {{system works}} on fixed <b>signal</b> <b>blocks</b> (a section of track {{that can be}} {{occupied}} by a train), with lit aspects indicating whether it is safe for a train to proceed into the next fixed <b>block.</b> <b>Interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> or protected signals are used where track features such as crossovers and pocket tracks exist where {{it is possible to}} route trains in either direction. The signals are directly connected to a trip arm that has the ability to stop a train if it violates a signal (runs a red light). This safety method is identical to that of the New York City Subway system.|$|R
25|$|Fixed <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> {{has been}} used {{throughout}} the subway system since the opening of Toronto's first subway in 1954. Along with automatic signalling, used to prevent rear-end train collision, <b>interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> are used to prevent collisions from conflicting movements on track crossovers.|$|R

50|$|At crowded {{stations}} on high-traffic lines, {{a platform}} track may {{be divided into}} two block sections so a following train can enter the track soon after the preceding train has departed. This signal is known as a No. 0 <b>block</b> <b>signal.</b> JR East treats this signal as a part of its home signals. At non-interlocking stations of JR West and other operators, the last <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> before the station is treated as a No. 0 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> and known as the home <b>signal</b> equivalent <b>block</b> <b>signal.</b> This signal is not absolute, since (unlike home signals) non-blocking operation is permitted. On ATOS (Automated Transport Operating System) lines <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> are numbered serially, regardless of non-interlocking stations. In this case, some <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> are defined as home-signal equivalent or starting-signal equivalent.|$|R
50|$|<b>Interlocking</b> <b>signals</b> {{are used}} in interlockings, which are any areas where train {{movements}} may conflict with each other.

30|$|Three {{distinct}} elements {{have been taken}} into consideration in the modelling phase. These elements are topology, interlocking table and train motion. While the topology model includes the states and positions of the <b>blocks,</b> points and <b>signals,</b> the <b>interlocking</b> table model comprises the basic requirements for opening all the possible routes. On the other hand, the train motion model represents the vehicle movement according to the signalization system.|$|R

50|$|A {{home signal}} (場内信号機, jōnai shingōki) permits trains {{to enter the}} station. A home signal is {{absolute}} (絶対信号機, zettai shingōki); therefore, non-blocking operation is always prohibited. Some stations have multiple home signals, due to station layout. In these cases, each home signal has an identification number which is counted from {{the outside of the}} station. In high-traffic areas, some operators install home signals {{in the center of a}} platform track to divide the block section. Some operators treat such <b>signals</b> as <b>block</b> <b>signals.</b> In non-interlocking stations, there may be a No.0 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> (in some operations, a No.1 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> or home-signal equivalent <b>block</b> <b>signal)</b> which alternates with the home signal.|$|R
30|$|The use of ATO {{makes it}} more {{practical}} to implement moving <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> [22, 32], and the two technologies are frequently implemented together on driverless metro systems around the world. Therefore, {{the replacement of the}} existing fixed <b>block</b> lineside <b>signalling</b> by a moving <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> system was also considered for the simulation work described in this paper.|$|R
25|$|The system {{currently}} uses <b>block</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{which is}} used in other systems such as the Toronto subway and RT. The <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> that the New York City Subway currently uses is identical to those on the RT's signaling system.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> (閉塞信号機, heisoku shingōki) {{begins a}} block section in an automatic-block system. In {{non-blocking}} operation a train can proceed past a <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> after stopping {{for one minute}} at the signal, even if the signal is [...] "stop".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Block</b> <b>signals</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used signals on the Toronto subway. They are used to keep trains properly spaced, and are controlled by the trains themselves, based on their distance relative to other trains. The following <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> are used by the TTC.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} identifying {{the support of the}} <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> in a sequence when both the length and the location of the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> are unknown. The multivariate version of this problem is also considered, in which we try to identify the support of the rectangular signal in the hyper- rectangle. We allow the length of the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> to grow polynomially with the length of the sequence, which greatly generalizes the previous results in [16]. A statistical boundary above which the identification is possible is presented and an asymptotically optimal and computationally efficient procedure is proposed under Gaussian white noise in both the univariate and multivariate settings. The problem of <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> identification is shown to have the same statistical difficulty as the corresponding problem of detection in both the univariate and multivariate cases, in the sense that whenever we can detect the signal, we can identify the support of the signal. Some generalizations are also considered here: (1) We ex- tend our theory to the case of multiple <b>block</b> <b>signals.</b> (2) We also discuss about the robust identification problem when the noise distribution is un- specified and the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> identification problem under the exponential family setting...|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} other rail lines, the signal system on the Market–Frankford Line has progressed from the {{original}} lineside <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> using semaphores, to three-aspect Type D color light (green, over yellow, over red) signals, to cab signalling, eliminating the lineside <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> except at interlockings.|$|R

In 2008 the seven mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins still commissioned were Ascot (not used), Charters Towers, Ingham, Innisfail, Kuranda, Laidley (rarely used) and Mackay. There are about 19 surviving decommissioned <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins complete with their frames in Queensland (six have been relocated), along with 36 signal cabins minus their signal frames, and 10 known signal frames in various states of intactness. Approximately 100 mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins have been demolished at stations around Queensland.|$|R
500|$|The Walt Disney World Railroad {{utilizes}} <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> {{to notify}} the engineers, firemen, and conductors on each train whether the track segments along the railroad's [...] of main-line track are clear or occupied by other trains. The WDWRR's track is divided into seven such segments, or blocks, and each block has a track-side <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> to communicate its status. <b>Block</b> <b>signals</b> are located {{at each of the}} three stations, alongside the three main-line blocks between the stations, and alongside the spur line connecting the WDWRR's roundhouse to the main line.|$|R
5000|$|Approach at Speed - When a train {{needs to}} be told to slow down due to dynamic {{conditions}} an [...] "Approach Speed" [...] aspect is used. These inform the engineer to slow to a prescribed speed by the next signal. The most common {{reason for this is}} that the train is to take a diverging, or non-Normal speed route at the next <b>interlocking.</b> <b>Signals</b> of this type include Approach Medium, Approach Limited, Approach Slow and Approach Diverging. These signals are typically displayed on the distant <b>signal</b> to an <b>interlocking,</b> but can sometimes be used with short <b>signal</b> <b>blocks</b> in place of Advance Approach.|$|R
