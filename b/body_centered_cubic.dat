From Dirac’s sea concept and the quark confinement idea, we conjecture and then assume that the quarks (in the vacuum state) compose colorless particles (uud and udd, hereafter will be called the Lee Particles). Moreover, the Lee Particles lead in a natural way to the construction- a <b>body</b> <b>center</b> <b>cubic</b> lattice in the vacuum. Consequently, there exists a strong interaction periodic field with <b>body</b> <b>center</b> <b>cubic</b> periodic symmetries and an electromagnetic interaction periodic field (from the charged Lee Particles uud) with simple cubic periodic symmetries in the vacuum. In terms of the energy band theory, using a point baryon approximation (i. e., omitting {{the structure of the}} Lee Particles), and from the symmetries of the strong interaction periodic field, we have deduced the intrinsic quantum numbers (I, S, C, b, Q) of all baryons and a unified mass formula from which all baryon masses can be found. This theoretical baryon spectrum is in accordance with the experimental results in both intrinsic quantum numbers and masses. These results show that various baryons are the energy band excited states of the Lee Particles. We also predict some new baryons...|$|R

40|$|The Standard Model while {{successful}} {{in many ways}} is incomplete [1]; many questions remain. The origin of quark masses and hadronization of quarks are awaiting an answer. From the Dirac sea concept, we infer that two kinds of elementary quarks (u(0) and d(0)) constitute a <b>body</b> <b>center</b> <b>cubic</b> (BCC) quark lattice with a lattice constant a ≤ 10 − 18 m in the vacuum. Using energy band theory and the BCC quark lattice, we can deduce the rest masses and the intrinsic quantum numbers (I, S, C, b and Q) of quarks. With the quark spectrum, we deduce a baryon spectrum.

In both lattices structures we imposed an uncompensated interfacial spin structure, in particular we emulated a FeF 2 -FM system {{in the case of}} the (bcc) lattice. Our analysis focused on the incidence of the interfacial strength interactions between the films J_eb and the effect of thermal fluctuations on the bias field H_EB. We first performed Monte Carlo simulations on a microscopic model based on classical Heisenberg spin variables. To analyze the simulation results we also introduced a simplified model that assumes coherent rotation of spins located on the same layer parallel to the interface. We found that, depending on the AFM film anisotropy to exchange ratio, the bias field is either controlled by the intrinsic pinning of a domain wall parallel to the interface or by the stability of the first AFM layer (quasi domain wall) near the interface.

The electrochemical simulation is carried out using a numerical method based on the Smoothed Boundary Method (SBM) [1]. The details of Li transport in the particles and electrolyte, electrostatics in the liquid, {{as well as the}} reaction at particle-electrolyte interfaces, are considered in this model. We assume that the nanoparticles (40 nm in diameter) are small enough such that two-phase coexistance within a particle is inhibited and that the nanoparticles are electrically well connected such that the electrostatic potential remains uniform in all particles. In order to calculate the Li insertion/extraction flux at the particle surface, we employed the modified Butler-Volmer equation proposed by Bai et al.
