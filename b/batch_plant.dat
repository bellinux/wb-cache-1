40|$|The timed Petri nets-based {{approach}} {{has been shown to}} be a very promising way to tackle the complicated operation scheduling in multipurpose/multiproduct <b>batch</b> <b>plants.</b> In this paper, it is extended to deal with the scheduling problems of <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> with variable batchsizes. In the formulation, the variable batchsizes in unit operations are implicitly represented as time places attached with a time interval. Also, the optimal scheduling algorithms for this class of <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> are developed.

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> system is the volumetric mobile mixers. Often referred to as On Site Concrete, Site Mixed Concrete or Mobile Mix Concrete. This is a mobile miniaturized version of the large stationary <b>batch</b> <b>plant.</b> They are used to provide Ready Mix Concrete utilizing a continuous batching process or metered concrete system. The volumetric mobile mixer is a truck that holds sand, rock, cement, water, fiber, and some add mixtures and color {{depending on how the}} <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> is outfitted. These trucks mix or batch the ready mix on the job site it's self. This type of truck can mix as much or as little amount of concrete as needed. The on site mixing eliminates the travel time hydration that can cause the transit mixed concrete to become unusable, These trucks are just as precise as the centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> system, since the trucks are scaled and tested using the same ASTM (American standard test method) like all other ready mix manufactures. This is a hybrid approach between centralized batch plants and traditional on-site mixing. Each type of system has it's advantages and disadvantages, depending on the location, size of the job, and mix design set forth by the engineer.|$|E

The concept of heat integration in <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> with the objective of minimising energy use is indeed an aspect of cleaner production that has received very limited attention in published literature. This is largely because <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> are perceived to be less energy-intensive compared to their continuous production counterparts which is untrue for some batch operations, like dairy and brewing processes; hence the need for dedicated techniques.

Mobile <b>batching</b> <b>plants</b> are typically a single unit, made up of a cement silo, an aggregate bin, an aggregate conveyor and the cement and aggregate batchers, but at higher hourly production capacities may require numerous loads for a single plant.

5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry mix plants and Wet mix plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> controls, and dust collectors.|$|E
