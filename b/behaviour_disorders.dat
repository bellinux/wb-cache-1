Currently, it is unclear whether these changes are present in so-called idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder,</b> a condition associated with a high rate of future conversion to Parkinsons disease. In this study, we explore the utility of resting state functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} to detect basal ganglia network dysfunction in rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder.</b> We compare these data to a set of healthy control subjects, and to a set of patients with established early Parkinsons disease. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between resting state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} basal ganglia network dysfunction and loss of dopaminergic neurons assessed with dopamine transporter single photon emission computerized tomography, and perform morphometric analyses to assess grey matter loss. Twenty-six patients with polysomnographically-established rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder,</b> 48 patients with Parkinsons disease and 23 healthy control subjects were included in this study.

In fact, some populations are affected by a lack of appetite others have seen a reduction of their food or fluid intake as well as a significant weight loss.

Other deficiencies that are observed with a persisting mercury intake are vitamin E, vitamin B12 and vitamin C. Long term deficiency in vitamin E might cause muscle weakness as well as loss of muscle mass, abnormal eye movements and even vision problems. As for Vitamin B12 deficiency, it might cause anemia and confusion for the elderly population. Finally, for long term Vitamin C deficiencies, high blood pressure as well as Gallbladder disease and stroke are all possible outcomes of those deficiencies. In order to avoid such deficiencies, a higher intake of those nutrients and vitamins are necessary.|$|E

The interventions stress a philosophy of normalisation, respect, non-confrontation, positive engagement, support, and functional and behavioural skill development. The approach is based on the observation that much of the behavioural disregulation is hostile/irritable aggression and not instrumental in nature. The interventions attempt to reduce environmental stressors and instigations to aggression and to use inclusion and positive engagement to reduce the frequency of aggressive behaviour. Evidence is currently limited to small-scale proof of concept designs and the approaches have not been subjected to randomised controlled investigations.|$|R

However, idiopathic {{rapid eye movement}} sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> can precede parkinsonism and dementia by several years. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging and neuromelanin-sensitive sequences, we previously found that the signal intensity was reduced in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area of patients with Parkinson’s disease and {{rapid eye movement sleep}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder.</b> Here, we studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex with neuromelanin-sensitive imaging in 21 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> and compared the results with those from 21 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent a clinical examination, motor, cognitive, autonomous, psychological, olfactory and colour vision tests, and rapid eye movement sleep characterization using video-polysomnography and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. The patients more frequently had preclinical markers of alpha-synucleinopathies, including constipation, olfactory deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and subtle motor impairment. Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was identified in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex of the patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour. The mean sensitivity of the visual analyses of the signal performed by neuroradiologists who were blind to the clinical diagnoses was 82. 5 %, and the specificity was 81 % for the identification of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour. The results confirm that this complex is affected in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour (to the same degree as it is affected in Parkinson’s disease).

Data were entered on demographics, injury severity, functional skills, functional-cognition (including executive functions), behaviour and CM and CS hours. Relationships were explored between areas of disability and service provision.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} symptoms of {{rapid eye movement sleep}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder,</b> thermoregulation and sleep in Parkinson's Disease. METHODS: The study group comprised 12 patients with Parkinson's Disease and 11 healthy age-matched controls. We investigated markers of thermoregulation (core-body temperature profile), circadian rhythm (locomotor actigraphy) and sleep (polysomnography). RESULTS: The mesor (the mean value around which the core temperature rhythm oscillates) of the core-body temperature in patients with Parkinson's Disease was significantly lower than that of controls. In addition, the nocturnal fall in CBT (the difference between the mesor and the nadir temperature) was also significantly reduced in PD patients relative to controls. Furthermore, in patients the reduction in the amplitude of their core-body temperature profile was strongly correlated with the severity of self-reported rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom, reduction in the percentage of REM sleep and prolonged sleep latency. By contrast, these disturbances of thermoregulation and sleep architecture were not found in controls and were not related to other markers of circadian rhythm or times of sleep onset and offset. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the brainstem pathology associated with disruption of thermoregulation in Parkinson's disease may also contribute to rapid eye movement sleep behavioural disorder. It is possible that detailed analysis of the core-body temperature profile in at risk populations such as those patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> might help identify those who are at high risk of transitioning to Parkinson's Disease...|$|R
40|$|My thesis aims {{to prove}} the {{hypothesis}} {{that there is an}} influence of an attachment organization on the development of an emotionally stable personality. According to the model of development psychopathology a secure attachment organization constitutes a protective factor and is associated with a desirable development of an individual.

An insecure attachement represents a specific vulnerability for further development of a child and it shows links with lower social competence, less effective emotional regulation and social adaption or with psychic disorders. The practical part of this thesis focuses on findings of correlations between an attachement organization to parents in early childhood and the extent of social adaption (determined by the extent of the occurence of <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorders).</b> From among demographic factors, the effect of age on connections between indicators of emotional attachment, parents representation, behaviour strategy and mental defects is investigated.

REM sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enacting behaviours linked to nightmares and REM sleep without atonia.
