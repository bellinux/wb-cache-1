40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} of features of beryllium disease to the estimated exposure to beryllium {{has been investigated}} over a 30 -year period at a factory manufacturing beryllium products. The factory opened in 1952. Of the 146 men who had worked there {{for more than six}} months up to 1963, 89 % were seen at that time and were followed up in 1973. The nine who continued to work in the factory and those who were engaged subsequently were examined in 1977. On each occasion a clinical interview, occupational history, chest radiograph, and assessment of lung function were carried out. The findings of the main survey were related to the beryllium content of the dust measured by mass spectrometry for 1952 - 60 when over 3000 determinations were made. In no part of the plant did the estimated average daily exposure exceed 2 μg m- 3, and only 9 % of individual determinations exceeded this level. Twenty determinations exceeded 25 μg m- 3. During the period under review, four men developed the clinical, radiographic, and physiological features of beryllium disease. Two men acquired abnormal chest radiographs consistent with beryllium disease but without other features, and one developed probable beryllium disease despite the diagnosis not being confirmed at necropsy. The affected men were all exposed to <b>beryllium</b> oxide or <b>hydroxide</b> but {{in a wide range of}} estimated doses. In six the changes developed after exposure had ceased; trigger factors including patch testing may have contributed to their illness. Seventeen men recalled episodes of brief exposure to high concentrations of dust, two developed pneumonitis from which they recovered completely, and one developed chronic beryllium disease after a further 23 years' exposure. In subjects without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease no convincing evidence was obtained for any association between the lung function and the estimated exposure to beryllium...|$|R
50|$|Most {{beryllium}} {{is extracted}} from <b>beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> One production method is sintering, done by mixing beryl, sodium fluorosilicate, and soda at high temperatures to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide, and silicon dioxide. A solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water is {{then used to}} form <b>beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> by precipitation. Alternatively, in the melt method, powdered beryl is heated to high temperature, cooled with water, then heated again slightly in sulfuric acid, eventually yielding <b>beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The <b>beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> from either method then produces beryllium fluoride and beryllium chloride through a somewhat long process. Electrolysis or heating of these compounds can then produce beryllium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> created {{using either}} the sinter or melt method is then {{converted}} into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride.

50|$|<b>Beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> Be(OH)2, is an {{amphoteric}} hydroxide, dissolving in both {{acids and}} alkalis. Industrially, it is produced as a by-product in {{the extraction of}} beryllium metal from the ores beryl and bertrandite. The natural pure <b>beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is rare (in form of the mineral behoite, orthorhombic) or very rare (clinobehoite, monoclinic). When alkali is added to beryllium salt solutions the α-form (a gel) is formed. If this left to stand or boiled, the rhombic β-form precipitates. This has the same structure as zinc hydroxide, Zn(OH)2, with tetrahedral beryllium centers.|$|E

40|$|When 5 mg {{doses of}} <b>beryllium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> Be(OH) 2, were {{injected}} intravenously (i. v.) into rats, {{much of the}} injected material was retained in the lungs. When the injection of Be(OH) 2 was accompanied by particulate antigens such as killed B. abortus organisms or SRBC, immune responses {{took place in the}} intra-thoracic lymph nodes (ITLN) so that antibodies of the IgA class were generated and endowed the bile with significant agglutinating activity. This did not happen when the antigens were injected without the beryllium adjuvant. Similarly, a soluble antigen, bovine serum albumin (BSA) only gave rise to significant amounts of biliary and serum antibodies after i. v. injection if Be(OH) 2 was used too. The highest titres occurred when the antigen followed the adjuvant after an interval of a few seconds but substantial titres still resulted if the injection of antigen was delayed for 24 hr. The amounts of biliary antibodies generated by the parenteral injection of antigen and adjuvant were comparable to those that occurred after the same materials were injected directly into the GALT. The adjuvant action of Be(OH) 2 was able to induce in athymic (nude) rats the production of measurable amounts of both biliary and serum antibodies to SRBC...|$|E
