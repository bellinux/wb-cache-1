Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a <b>biopsy.</b> Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the frequency of buried Barrett's in <b>biopsies</b> obtained from small residual Barrett's islands (  <  5  mm) sampled post-RFA, compared with <b>biopsies</b> from normal neosquamous epithelium. <b>Biopsies</b> obtained from normal-appearing neosquamous epithelium and from small Barrett's islands (  <  5  mm) in 69 consecutive Barrett's patients treated with RFA were evaluated for the presence of buried columnar mucosa.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{microarray}} {{technology has been}} used increasingly to acquire knowledge about the pathogenic processes involved in rheumatoid arthritis. The present study investigated variations in gene expression in synovial tissues within and between patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This was done by applying microarray technology on multiple synovial <b>biopsies</b> obtained from the same knee joints. In this way the relative levels of intra-patient and inter-patient variation could be assessed. The <b>biopsies</b> were obtained from 13 different patients: 7 by orthopedic surgery and 6 by rheumatic arthroscopy. The data show that levels of heterogeneity varied substantially between the <b>biopsies,</b> {{because the number of}} genes found to be differentially expressed between pairs of <b>biopsies</b> from the same knee ranged from 6 to 2, 133. Both arthroscopic and orthopedic <b>biopsies</b> were examined, allowing us to compare the two sampling methods. We found that the average number of differentially expressed genes between <b>biopsies</b> from the same patient was about three times larger in orthopedic than in arthroscopic <b>biopsies.</b> Using a parallel analysis of the tissues by immunohistochemistry, we also identified orthopedic <b>biopsies</b> that were unsuitable for gene expression analysis of synovial inflammation due to sampling of non-inflamed parts of the tissue. Removing these <b>biopsies</b> reduced the average number of differentially expressed genes between the orthopedic <b>biopsies</b> from 455 to 171, in comparison with 143 for the arthroscopic <b>biopsies.</b> Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the remaining orthopedic and arthroscopic <b>biopsies</b> had gene expression signatures that were unique for each patient, apparently reflecting patient variation rather than tissue heterogeneity. Subsets of genes found to vary between <b>biopsies</b> were investigated for overrepresentation of biological processes by using gene ontology.

40|$|Abstract Background The patchy {{nature of}} villous lesion in celiac disease is {{increasingly}} being recognized. Current guidelines recommend four endoscopic duodenal mucosal <b>biopsies</b> {{from the second}} or more distal part of the duodenum to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the usefulness of duodenal bulb mucosal <b>biopsies</b> in confirming the diagnosis of celiac disease in everyday clinical practice. Methods All patients with a positive tissue-transglutaminase antibody requiring biopsy-confirmation of celiac disease over a two-year period were studied. Two endoscopic <b>biopsies</b> were taken from the duodenal bulb and four <b>biopsies</b> from the second (or distal) part of the duodenum. Results Thirty-five patients were included, mean age 8. 1 (± 4. 7) years. Thirty-one (88. 6 %) patients had abnormal distal duodenal <b>biopsies,</b> one had Marsh type 1, one had Marsh type 2 and twenty-nine had Marsh type 3 lesion. All but two patients with abnormal distal duodenal <b>biopsies</b> also had abnormal bulb <b>biopsies.</b> Four (11. 4 %) patients had normal distal duodenal <b>biopsies</b> but abnormal bulb <b>biopsies.</b> Of these, one patient had Marsh type 2 and three had Marsh type 3 lesion. The distal duodenum was also grossly normal in these four patients. The histological diagnosis of celiac disease would not have been possible in these four cases with distal duodenal <b>biopsies</b> only. Conclusion The lesion in celiac disease in children can be patchy with duodenal bulb mucosa being the only area showing histological changes. The recommendations regarding the site of <b>biopsies</b> should be revised to include <b>biopsies</b> not only from distal duodenum but also from bulb to improve the diagnostic yield. </p...|$|R

5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even <b>biopsy</b> is dependent on the location of the <b>biopsy.</b> Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic <b>biopsy,</b> combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin <b>biopsy</b> or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a <b>biopsy</b> will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions.

Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E

Overall, neoplasia was detected in 88 colonoscopies (53 patients) : in 75 colonoscopies (85 %) by targeted <b>biopsies</b> only and in 8 (9. 1 %) by both targeted and random <b>biopsies.</b> Neoplasia was detected in random <b>biopsies</b> only in five (5. 7 %) colonoscopies in four (7. 5 %) patients.

We describe our experience of analyzing the expression of cytotoxic T-lymphotoxins (CTL) in <b>biopsies</b> and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) for the diagnosis of AR. METHODS: We analyzed Perforin (P), Granzyme B (GB) and Fas Ligand (FL) expression in 68 renal <b>biopsies</b> and 64 PBL using comparative kinetic RT-PCR and, for GAPDH and FL, we also replicated with real-time RT-PCR. The levels of expression were measured in different groups, such as T 0 (<b>biopsies</b> before reperfusion and PBL in recipient before the transplant [Tx]), Td (<b>biopsies</b> and PBL collected for clinical purposes) and Tp (<b>biopsies</b> and PBL two months after Tx). RESULTS: A higher CTL expression was seen in non-rejecting (NR) <b>biopsies</b> in the first 2 months after Tx. P and FL were significantly more expressed during AR in all <b>biopsies</b> and in Td, while P remained upregulated in Tp. In PBL, there was no significant increase in CTL transcription during AR. A variable expression of CTL emerged in all T 0 <b>biopsies.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Two lytic pathways are activated in <b>biopsies</b> when AR occurs shortly after Tx, whereas the P/GB mechanism prevails if it occurs later on. Only P and FL in <b>biopsies</b> might be able to predict AR diagnosis, but with a considerable variability in each sample, possibly due to the small portion of tissue core, which may be inadequate for molecular diagnosis.
