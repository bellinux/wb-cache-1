40|$|Geosynthetic (prefabricated) {{vertical}} <b>band</b> <b>drains</b> are {{now considered}} {{as one of the}} most cost effective ground improvement technics in many parts of the world, where construction on soft compressible clays is inevitable. However, smear effects caused by PVD installation (eg. mandrel based), drain clogging, drain kinking and well resistance of long drains retard the excess pore pressure dissipation making these drains often less effective in the field, contrary to expectations. Consequently, the rate of settlement of the stabilised soft clay becomes significantly less than what is expected from ideal drains. This paper addresses comprehensively, the numerical modelling aspects of PVD, and the interpretation of field data taken from several case studies, which elucidate the drain performance under various boundary conditions. Theoretical and finite element modelling details are described based on various research studies, mainly through the authors’ own experience.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the effect of}} unsaturation at a drain boundary on the behaviour of a single prefabricated vertical drain subjected to vacuum preloading based on a two-dimensional plane strain finite element model incorporating the modified Cam Clay model. Unsaturation of soil adjacent to the drain can occur due to mandrel withdrawal or application of vacuum pressure through prefabricated vertical <b>band</b> <b>drains</b> (PVDs). Following initial laboratory simulation in a large-scale radial drainage consolidometer, the authors have attempted to explain the observed retardation of pore pressure dissipation {{through a series of}} models, which consider the effect of unsaturation at the drain-soil interface. The results indicate that the introduction of an unsaturated soil layer adjacent to a PVD improves the accuracy of numerical predictions. Lastly, a multidrain analysis is conducted to study the behaviour of an embankment stabilized with vertical drains subjected to vacuum preloading, and the field measurements are compared with a series of numerical model predictions.

The finite element code CRISP, which is based on critical-state soil mechanics, has been employed to investigate the performance of the embankment and the underlying soft clay. Predictions of the excess pore pressures and both vertical and lateral displacements are made and compared with field observations. The limited use of closed-form solutions for the prediction of settlements at the line of symmetry of the embankment is also discussed. The effectiveness of the prefabricated drains has been evaluated according to the rate of excess-pore-pressure dissipation at the soil-drain interface. The numerical approach is based on a coupled consolidation analysis rather than on a conventional, purely undrained analysis. The numerical analysis reveals that for efficient vertical drains, the influence of smear and well resistance can be ignored. While the assumption of perfect drains may be acceptable in the long term, the short-term settlements are governed by the drain efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Railways have {{technical}} and economic advantages, and therefore, railway traffic {{has gained a}} specific and irreplaceable position in recent years. With this background, and to satisfy their rapid development, railways will inevitably be constructed on soft soil subgrade such as soft clay subgrade. It is desired to understand the behaviour of soft clay subgrade subjected to cyclic loads when a new rail track is designed or an existing one is under maintenance. When the soft clay subgrade is subjected to the cyclic loading, excess pore pressures and axial strains keep developing with {{the increasing number of}} cycles, resulting in a decreased bearing capacity of the subgrade and excessive settlement. To improve the subgrade, prefabricated vertical <b>band</b> <b>drains</b> (PVDs) is used increasingly in popularity among a variety of techniques. With the installation of PVDs, a short radial drainage path is introduced to dissipate the excess pore pressure so that the soft clay subgrade becomes more stable subjected to train loads. This thesis covers the laboratory tests and numerical modelling. The behaviour of soft clays under cyclic loading with or without radial drainage is investigated. A series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on specimens of reconstituted Kaolinite. Three cyclic stress ratios and four loading frequencies were used in the laboratory tests to study the performance of soft subgrade soil subjected to cyclic loading. The effects of cyclic stress ratio and loading frequency on the generation of excess pore pressures and axial strains were investigated. The roles of cyclic stress ratio and loading frequency play in influencing the stability of soft clay subgrade were discussed. The effect of strain rate for a stress controlled test on the performance of soft clays under cyclic loading was investigated. The relationship between the strain rate and either cyclic stress ratio or loading frequency were figured out, and in this way, the influence of cyclic stress ratio and loading frequency on the progressive shear failure and excessive plastic deformation were justified. Furthermore, due to a high strain rate varying from 150 to 550...|$|R

Britain, by thee we fell, ungrateful isle! Not by thy valour, but superior guile: Britain, with shame, confess this land of mine First taught thee human knowledge and divine; My prelates and my students, sent from hence, Made your sons converts both to God and sense: Not like the pastors of thy ravenous breed, Who come to fleece the flocks, and not to feed. [...] Wretched Ierne! with what grief I see The fatal changes time has made in thee! The Christian rites I introduced in vain: Lo! infidelity return'd again! Freedom and virtue in thy sons I found, Who now in vice and slavery are drown'd.

I sent the magpie from the British soil, With restless beak thy blooming fruit to spoil; To din thine ears with unharmonious clack, And haunt thy holy walls in white and black. What else are those thou seest in bishop's gear, Who crop the nurseries of learning here; Aspiring, greedy, full of senseless prate, Devour the church, and chatter to the state? [...] As you grew more degenerate and base, I sent you millions of the croaking race; Emblems of insects vile, who spread their spawn Through all thy land, in armour, fur, and lawn; A nauseous brood, that fills your senate walls, And in the chambers of your viceroy crawls!

40|$|The {{emerging}} nanowire {{technology in}} recent years has attracted an increasing interest for high-speed, low-power electronics due to the possibility of a gate-all-around (GAA) geometry enabling aggressive gate length scaling, together with the ease in incorporating high-mobility narrow band gap III-V semiconductors such as InAs on Si substrates. These benefits make vertical nanowire transistors an attractive alternative to the planar devices. However, huge challenges are also encountered. Apart from the large parasitics associated with the device layout, vertical III-V/high-k nanowire MOSFETs so far are also suffering from a less efficient gate control partially due to the defect states existing in the MOS gate stack. Besides the narrow band gap InAs may result in impact-ionization and band-to-band tunneling at high drain voltages, influencing both the power efficiency and speed of modern integrated circuits (ICs). In this thesis, results on planar InAs/high-k MOS gate stacks investigated in detail using both the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques are first presented (Paper I and II). The origin of the specific trap state energy distribution is clarified and compared to the well studied InGaAs and GaAs materials. The results highlight the benefit of using InAs, with optimized high-k deposition strategies, as the n-MOSFET channel. The second focus of the thesis is the improvement of vertical GAA nanowire MOS gate stacks (Paper III and IV). By developing the fabrication scheme and design, conventional C-V technique is successfully applied to extract detailed trap state distributions. A low interface trap state density (Dit) below 10 E 12 eV- 1 cm- 2 near the MOS semiconductor conduction band edge is achieved. Furthermore, RF C-V measurements, together with the development of a complete small signal equivalent circuit model, for vertical GAA nanowire MOS systems are also presented for the first time, which enables characterizations of border trap density, interface trap density, channel resistivity and quality factor of the nanowire MOSFETs simultaneously. The third focus is the development of a device structure to reduce detrimental impact-ionization and band-to-band tunneling due to the narrow band gap of InAs (Paper V and VI). An asymmetric InAs/InGaAs vertical nanowire MOSFET with a large <b>band</b> gap <b>drain</b> region is proposed, taking advantage of the efficient strain relaxation of nanowire epitaxial growth. Control of the InGaAs nanowire composition has been successfully demonstrated. Finally, a vertical integration scheme was developed in the thesis, where track-and-hold circuits, consisting of a MOSFET in series with a metal-insulator-metal capacitor, were successfully fabricated along vertical InAs nanowires (Paper VII) ...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, the {{scaling of}} {{conventional}} CMOS transistors and supply voltage have been faced with {{problems such as}} high off-state current, SCEs, DIBL, and subthreshold swing limits of 60  mV/dec at room temperature [1, 2, 3]. Therefore, some various device structures such as double gate [4], tri-gate [5], gate-all-around (GAA) MOSFET [6], and junctionless field-effect transistor JLFET [7] have been reported. JLFET has been fabricated without using PN junctions at the lateral junctions. Although it simplifies the fabrication process, it also suffers from the high off-state current. Tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs) recently replaced the conventional MOSFET due to its steeper subthreshold swing (SS) (<[*] 60  mV/dec) and low off-state current (Ioff) {{which leads to the}} low values of power consumption [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The achievement was obtained due to the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) carriers rather than drift–diffusion over the barrier. One of the drawbacks of the performance of TFETs is the inferior on-state current (Ion) because of the insufficient quantum BTBT limited by the large bandgap of silicon. Hence, it can be solved using low bandgap semiconductors [13]. Lately, different methods of improving the performance of TFETs have been presented such as gate engineering [14], using heterostructures and high-k dielectric [15]. TFETs also suffer from ambipolar behavior [16, 17], which is concluded from the presence of symmetric areas of P+ and N+ in the source and the drain, the overlapping between the valence band of the channel, and the conduction <b>band</b> of the <b>drain</b> under negative gate bias. In this condition, the channel is accumulated by holes due to BTBT at drain/channel interface. Therefore, it has created a high current drive at the negative voltage similar to the positive voltage. To overcome the ambipolar behavior, researchers have used hetero-gate dielectrics, gate workfunction engineering, asymmetric doping for source and drain [18], Gaussian-doping profiles, and gate–drain overlapping [14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22].|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{drainage}} {{has been}} an important water management practice for farming some of the most productive soils of the Midwest; however there have been environmental costs. The objectives of this study were to statistically determine the accuracy and precision of nitrate-N loss estimates from subsurface drainage based on various sampling frequencies, to predict subsurface drain flow, crop yield, and nitrate-N losses using DRAINMOD 5. 0, which is a commonly used hydrology/water quality model, and to incorporate uncertainty analysis into modeling. A methodology was developed to determine the accuracy and precision of nitrate-N loss estimates from subsurface drainage plots based on various sampling frequencies. Results showed that the probability of estimating the annual nitrate-N mass loss within ± 15 % of the “true” mass loss was 92 % for the weekly sample frequency, 68 % for the monthly frequency, and 51 % for the 90 -day frequency. An automatic calibration framework was developed to calibrate DRAINMOD for predicting drain flow and nitrate-N losses. Fifteen years of data were used to test the hydrology component and five years of data were used to test the nitrogen component. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for drain flow predictions ranged from − 0. 66 to 0. 81, with average deviations from 0. 01 to 0. 07 cm/day and standard errors from 0. 03 to 0. 17 cm/day. DRAINMOD correctly predicted the pattern of yearly relative yield change. The relative corn and soybean yields were well predicted based on average measure, with percent errors from 1. 3 to 9. 7 % for corn and from − 0. 8 to 10. 3 % for soybean. The percent errors for yearly nitrate-N mass losses ranged from − 16. 6 to 97. 5 %. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation procedure was used to evaluate the uncertainties in DRAINMOD drain flow predictions associated with uncertainties in input parameters. The width of 90 % confidence interval <b>band</b> of predicted <b>drain</b> flow ranged from 7. 6 to 12. 4 cm/yr, with predicted means of 8. 3 to 20. 2 cm/yr and standard deviations of 2. 3 to 3. 8 cm/yr. The most influential parameters were the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer and the lateral hydrologic conductivity of the deepest soil layer. The main contributions to the prediction uncertainty are due to parameter interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|L'identification de pratiques agricoles qui minimisent les risques de {{contamination}} des eaux de surface nécessite d'évaluer l'importance des voies de transfert des herbicides vers les cours d'eau. Le but de cette étude est d'évaluer à l'échelle du champ agricole et pour une saison de culture l'exportation effective de l'atrazine et du métolachlore par ruissellement de surface et par drainage, ceci pour des conditions pédo-climatiques et agronomiques représentatives de la culture intensive du maïs-grain dans les Basses-Terres du St-Laurent (Québec). Pour les deux premiers événements pluviaux d'importance suivant l'application des herbicides, seulement deux des six champs étudiés ont présenté un ruissellement quittant le champ : les concentrations en herbicides ont atteint 1200 mg/L et 2400 mg/L. La charge exportée en herbicides semble inférieure dans le cas du non travail du sol (semis direct), comparativement au labour conventionnel. Les concentrations en herbicides dans l'eau de drainage sont inférieures à 6 mg/L (pour la majorité inférieures à 1 - 2 mg/L) pour quatre champs, {{alors que}} deux champs ont présenté des concentrations atteignant 40 - 60 mg/L. La charge exportée par drainage apparaît être faible dans le cas de l'application d'herbicides en bandes, comparativement à l'application en surface totale. La masse en herbicides exportée par ruissellement (estimée à partir de coefficients de ruissellement probables) serait supérieure à celle par drainage. Une démarche destinée à diminuer les masses en herbicides exportées devrait ainsi viser la principale voie de cette exportation, c'est-à-dire le ruissellement de surface. The {{use of pesticides}} in agriculture may result in the degradation of surface water quality. Since agricultural practices affect the transport of pesticides, {{there is a need}} to identify practices which minimize the contribution of the different transport paths to the streams, i. e. runoff and drainage. The aim of this study was to evaluate at the field scale and for one growing season the transport of the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor to surface water under soil, climatic and agricultural conditions representative of those encountered for intensive corn cropping in the St-Lawrence Lowlands (Quebec). Six agricultural fields (Figure 1) were studied in 1995. Previous agricultural practices in 1994 and soil texture are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Conventional practices (tillage with moldboard plow and application of herbicides over the entire area of the field) and conservation practices (no-till and banded application of herbicides over the seeded row) were studied. Each field was solely and entirely drained by one subsurface drain. The commercial formulation used in 1995 contained a mass of metolachlor two times higher than that for atrazine. Herbicide concentrations in runoff and drainage waters were monitored during the two first important rainfall events that occurred after herbicide application (Table 3). Sampled runoff corresponded to the water reaching a drainage channel or a stream. Drainage water was also collected for 3. 5 - 4. 5 months following the initial application. A total of 164 water samples was obtained. After sediment removal, metolachlor, atrazine and its dealkylated metabolite deethylatrazine (DEA) were extracted using a liquid-solid extraction procedure and analyzed by gas chromatography. Only two fields produced runoff and the concentrations of parent-compounds (Figures 2 and 3) were high and varied during rainfall events between 60 - 500 mg/L (Field 2) or 130 - 2400 mg/L (Field 6). Concentrations found during the first rainfall event were higher than those encountered during the second event. The DEA/atrazine concentration ratio (DAR) was below or near 0. 1, indicating runoff of recently applied atrazine (low degradation). These two fields present similar soil texture, pluviometry and sampling periods after herbicide application. Based on runoff coefficients observed for other agricultural fields (1 - 30 %), it was estimated that the mass losses for herbicides (Table 4) would be higher under conventional tillage(Field 6) as compared to no-till (Field 2). Significant transport of herbicides by drainage was observed during the two rainfall events. The losses of herbicides that occurred after these events and during a dry growing season (little or no drainage flow) were low. The drainage losses (concentration or masses) during the two rainfall events for Field 1 (clay) were very low. This was attributed to the low drainage capacity of the soil, to the low rainfall intensities as well as to the important delay between the initial application and the subsequent rainfalls. For silty clay loam to loam soils, the drainage flow increased in the 6 - 12 h period following the onset of rainfall, as did the herbicide concentrations. Metolachlor concentrations were slightly higher or close to those for atrazine: this was attributed to its possible more rapid decay and to its stronger tendency to adsorb to the soil. During the rainfall events, four fields exhibited herbicide concentrations from drainage less than 6 mg/L (mostly < 1 - 2 mg/L). Fields 2 and 6 yielded parent-compound concentrations as high as 40 - 60 mg/L (Figures 4 and 5). The DAR values found for drainage water of Field 2 (0. 1 - 0. 5) were higher than those observed from runoff, indicating significant dealkylation of atrazine had occurred during its transport in the unsaturated zone. Field 6 allowed the monitoring of the DAR over the growing season and an inverse relationship was found between the DAR and atrazine concentration (Figure 6). This was attributed to the larger variation in atrazine concentration during a rainfall as compared to that of DEA. A DAR value near 1 was obtained at 1 - 2 months after application, indicating important degradation of atrazine. The total mass losses of parent-compounds (two rainfall events) were evaluated (Table 5) except for Fields 2 and 4 which present frequent submerged <b>drains.</b> <b>Banded</b> herbicide application (Field 5) results in consistent lower losses of herbicide masses than those obtained for application over the entire surface (e. g. Field 5 compared to Fields 3 and 6). It should be noted that the higher export observed for the entire surface application may be partly attributed to a shorter delay between application and rainfalls (Fields 3 and 6) or to a higher rainfall intensity (Field 6). Although runoff reaching surface waters was limited, it was estimated that the total herbicide losses (Table 4) during the two rainfall events were higher than those from drainage (Table 5). In the perspective of reducing the herbicide loads reaching streams, it appears that remedial actions should focus on this main route of transport. Thus, complementary actions such as vegetated buffer strips to intercept crop land runoff may possibly be useful to limit herbicide transfer to streams in intensive agricultural zones...|$|R
