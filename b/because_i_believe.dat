His staff and police {{protection}} officers were granted visas within three days, but Wilders was not. On 2 October 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, while stating that Wilders' views were offensive, stated {{that he would not}} block the visa application. Bowen stated: [...] "I have decided not to intervene to deny him a visa <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that our democracy is strong enough, our multiculturalism robust enough and our commitment to freedom of speech entrenched enough that our society can withstand the visit of a fringe commentator {{from the other side of}} the world".|$|E
500|$|She also sang [...] "Listen" [...] {{during the}} finals on December 21, 2011.

Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S.
