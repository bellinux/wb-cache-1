He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency". He has also stated that, [...] "If your country needs you, you should <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> that is the way I felt when I was young, and that's the way I feel today." ...|$|E
500|$|Still {{hoping to}} work on Cheers, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of Taxi to Cheers writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two {{approved}} and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show's first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin's agent rejected the Cheers job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want {{to work on}} {{what was then the}} lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of Newhart, which like Cheers was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin [...] "felt [...] was where I belonged. I'd finally come to a place in my life where everything I'd ever wanted had come together." [...] In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Newhart. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series' showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the Newhart episodes he wrote because he saw directing as [...] "a means of protecting the writing". A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that [...] "being the head writer... was not enough; you had to see the material through its execution– especially the weirder stuff. You had to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> to make sure every sick idea didn't lose any disturbing nuance." [...] Mirkin left Newhart in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.|$|E

2500|$|Maezumi was {{forthcoming}} in admitting {{his mistakes}} {{and did not}} justify his behaviors. These events caused much turmoil in his school, and many students left as a result. Some members who stayed described themselves as forced to see Maezumi on a more human level, even seeing this period as a breakthrough for them, no longer deluded into thinking a teacher could be beyond imperfection. Both Bays and Tetsugen Bernard Glassman founded their own sanghas at this time. When remembering Maezumi, author David Chadwick had this to say: [...] "I'd say he had an interesting mix of humility and arrogance. Mainly to me he'd seem arrogant at a distance, but close up he'd <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> with me not putting on any airs." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} hard to say how the rumour first got into the City on this Monday morning. Though the elder Longestaffe had first heard of the matter only on the {{previous}} Saturday, Mr Squercum had been at work for above a week. Mr Squercum's little matter alone might hardly have attracted the attention which certainly was given on this day to Mr Melmotte's private affairs;--but other facts coming to light assisted Squercum's views. A great many shares of the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway had been thrown upon the market, all of which had passed through the hands of Mr Cohenlupe;--and Mr Cohenlupe in the City had been all to Mr Melmotte as Lord Alfred had been at the West End. Then there was the mortgage of this Pickering property, for which the money certainly had not been paid; and there was the traffic with half a street of houses near the Commercial Road, by which a large sum of money had come into Mr Melmotte's hands. It might, no doubt, all <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> <b>There</b> were many who thought that it would all <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> <b>There</b> were not a few who expressed the most thorough contempt for these rumours. But it was felt to be a pity that Mr Melmotte was not in the City.|$|E

"Well, you may <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> Colonel, but {{putting aside}} my {{conviction}} that Lady Greendale {{has no idea}} of marrying again, {{is the fact that}} at present all her thoughts are occupied by her daughter. She is not at all what you would call a managing mother, but I am sure that she has set her heart on Bertha's making a good match, and that the fear that she will succumb to some penniless younger son or other unsuitable partner is at present the dominant feeling in her mind. I don't think she would have agreed to Jack Hawley being of the party, had not Bertha entertained a conviction that he was rather gone on Miss Sinclair, who by the way has, like her sister, money enough to disregard the fact that Jack is hardly in that respect well endowed.|$|E

6000|$|Cauer {{remarks that}} the {{possibility}} of [...] "interpolation" [...] "began only after the fixing of the text by Pisistratus." [...] [Footnote: Grundfragen, p. 205.] But surely if every poet and reciter could thrust any new lines which he chose to make into any old lays which he happened to know, that was interpolation, whether he had a book of the words or had none. Such interpolations would fill the orally recited lays which the supposed Pisistratean editor must have written down from recitation before he began his colossal task of making the Iliad out of them. If, on the other hand, reciters had books of the words, they could interpolate at pleasure into them, and such books may have been among the materials used in the construction of a text for the Athenian book market. But if our theory <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> <b>there</b> must always have been a few copies of better texts than those of the late reciters' books, and the effort of the editors for the book market would be to keep the parts in which most manuscripts were agreed.|$|E

"O, {{we went to}} the Hôtel Dieu, for one thing, and {{afterwards}} we looked into the court-yard of the convent; and there another of his pleasant little traits came out,--a way he has of always putting you in the wrong even when it's a matter of no consequence any way, and there needn't be any right or wrong about it. I remembered the place because Mrs. March, you know, showed us a rose that one of the nuns in the hospital gave her, and I tried to tell Mr. Arbuton about it, and he graciously took it as if poor Mrs. March had made an advance towards his acquaintance. I do wish you could see what a lovely place that court-yard is, Fanny. It's so strange that such a thing should <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> in the heart of this crowded city; but there it was, with its peasant cottage on one side, and its long, low barns on the other, and those wide-horned Canadian cows munching at the racks of hay outside, and pigeons and chickens all about among their feet--" ...|$|E

With hundreds of ships loading and unloading on this side right into the freight cars of three big railroads, factories will start up over here instead of crossing to San Francisco. That means factory sites. That means me buying in the factory sites before anybody guesses the cat is going to jump, much less, which way. Factories mean tens of thousands of workingmen and their families. That means more houses and more land, and that means me, for I'll be there to sell them the land.
