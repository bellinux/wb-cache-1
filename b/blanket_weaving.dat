50|$|Salish <b>blanket</b> <b>weaving</b> {{declined}} in the early 20th century; here's why. In 1884 a law had been passed banning religious practices of the First Nations people {{as part of an}} attempt by the colonizers to ‘civilize’ the indigenous population. (This law stayed in force til the 1920s.) The important potlatch ceremony was included in this ban. In addition to these laws, colonizers also brought with them their own wool blankets, most famously the off-white Hudson’s Bay Company blankets which featured red, yellow and green stripes. Because of their quick production time, these HBC blankets were as much as twenty times cheaper than the traditional Salish blankets. Traditional goat-hair blankets were valued at twenty times the Hudson Bay blankets because of their better material and more labour-intensive production. As <b>blanket</b> <b>weaving</b> declined, Salish women began to adopt the practice of knitting sweaters and other garments. These sweaters, known as ‘Cowichan’ after the Vancouver Island Salish community, were made with sheep's wool obtained from the settlers. The form was the traditional European cardigan sweater, but the designs knitted into the garment were such Salish motifs as eagles and whales. While these knitted garments did not have the same ceremonial or symbolic importance as the woven blankets, they were nonetheless worn during notable civic and religious events.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972 Dr. Wheat took {{a sabbatical}} to conduct {{research}} on Southwest textiles. He examined hundreds of chemical tests on yarns and visited many museums to study thousands of 19th century textiles, {{with the goal of}} establishing [...] "a key for southwestern textiles identification based on the traits that distinguish the Pueblo, Navajo, and Spanish American <b>blanket</b> <b>weaving</b> traditions and provide a better way of identifying and dating pieces of unknown origin.” The years of research resulted in the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] publication of [...] "Blanket Weavings in the Southwest" [...] which was released six years after his death with editorial help by Ann Hedlund, a respected textile scholar and protégée of Wheat.|$|E

5000|$|Before European {{contact the}} Coast Salish peoples, {{including}} the Cowichan, <b>wove</b> <b>blankets,</b> leggings, and tumplines out of mountain goat wool, dog hair, and other fibres. [...] The wool was spun with a spindle and whorl, and the <b>blankets</b> were <b>woven</b> on a two-bar loom. There is little information on pre-contact production {{and use of}} these weavings, although examples remain in museum collections. No archaeological or ethnographic evidence of knitting or knitting needles exists.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} Chilkat <b>blanket</b> <b>weaving</b> on Vancouver Island. Who were the weavers, what materials and methods did they use in weaving and of what significance are the blankets today? The initial phase consisted of locating a source of blankets and making friends with an Indian who had access to the source. An analysis sheet was prepared in order to record the history of each blanket, the method of construction and the interpretation or descrip-tion of pattern designs. Slides were taken of all available blankets. It soon became apparent that most of the weaving was done by Mary Hunt, a Tlingit wQman who lived amongst the Kwakiuti. people of Fort Rupert. She developed an identifiable, atypical Chilkat blanket that is a Kwakiutl version of the Chilkat blanket. Three other Redacted for privacy women watched her and produced their variations of her original version. Characteristics of the Mary Hunt blankets were: experimentation with warp- loom sewing * eccentric and some vertical multiple strand twining done with a needle and yarn use of green and occasionally red colors distinguishable signature variations of one main pattern ornamental border braiding made separately and attached by hand. use of embroidery to simulate weaving The final stage consisted of recording the uses of the Kwakiutl version of the Chilkat blanket in contemporary society and locating weavers and potential weavers in the area...|$|E

He ordered Edgar to carry his portion into the tent, where, under the instructions of the sheik's wife, {{the articles}} were all stowed away. The tent, which was a large one, was constructed of black <b>blanketing</b> <b>woven</b> by the women from camels' hair, and was divided into two portions by a hanging of the same materials. The one next to the entrance was the general living and reception room, that behind being for the use of the sheik's wife and children.|$|R

50|$|Many {{types of}} blanket material, such as wool, are used {{because they are}} thicker and have more {{substantial}} fabric to them, but cotton {{can also be used}} for light blankets. Wool blankets are warmer and also relatively slow to burn compared to cotton. The most common types of <b>blankets</b> are <b>woven</b> acrylic, knitted polyester, mink, cotton, fleece and wool. Blankets also come with exotic crafting and exotic material such as crocheted afghan or a silk covering. The term blanket is often interchanged with comforter, quilt, and duvet, as they all have similar uses.|$|R
