5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to the Gilded Age, Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George <b>B.</b> <b>Post</b> won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank, with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E

25|$|In 1904, the Cleveland Trust Company invited architects {{from around}} the nation to {{participate}} in a competition to design the headquarters building it intended to build on the First Methodist/Wedge land. In November of that year, the company selected New York City-based architect George <b>B.</b> <b>Post</b> to design the structure. Post was a nationally known architect whose works included the New York World Building (1890), then the world's tallest building; the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building at the World's Columbian Exposition (1893), the Bronx Borough Hall in The Bronx, New York (1897); and the New York Stock Exchange building (1903). Post was already known in Cleveland for designing the Williamson Building (1900), an 18-story office building on Public Square.|$|E
25|$|Leavitt {{became a}} sought-after specialist, {{particularly}} in landscape and garden design, and designed the gardens at estates belonging to such figures as Walter P. Chrysler, William C. Whitney, for whom Leavitt also designed a private racetrack on his estate, Henri Willis Bendel, Daniel S. Lamont, Foxhall P. Keene, Felix M. Warburg, Lillian Sefton Dodge, H. Fletcher Brown, E. K. Cone, George C. Smith, Issachar Cozzen III, Carlton Macy, George <b>B.</b> <b>Post,</b> Harry K. Knapp, Anson W. Hard and others. Most of Leavitt's landscape commissions {{were in the}} New Jersey hunt country and the North Shore of Long Island, but he also worked as far afield as Pasadena, California and Duluth, Minnesota. Sometimes he acted as landscape architect on homes designed by other architects; often he also designed the homes {{as well as the}} adjacent landscaping.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, it {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), {{superseding}} five smaller historic districts that had been listed on the Register in the early 1970s. (Two years later, in 1988, the extension of the previous River Street Historic District north of Federal Street was added separately to the NRHP as the Northern River Street Historic District.) In late 2014, the State Historic Preservation Board began considering an adjustment to the district's boundaries that would be a net expansion, particularly in its southeast; that increase was made official in 2016. Most of the buildings, structures and objects within the district contribute to its historic character. Two of Troy's four National Historic Landmarks, the Gurley Building and Troy Savings Bank, are located within its boundaries. Nine other buildings are listed on the Register in their own right. Among the architects represented are Alexander Jackson Davis, George <b>B.</b> <b>Post,</b> Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers. There are many buildings designed [...] by the regionally significant architect Marcus F. Cummings. The downtown street plan was borrowed from Philadelphia, and one neighborhood, Washington Square, was influenced by London's squares of its era.|$|E

2500|$|The {{anticipated}} {{economic development}} never occurred. At the 1898 {{meeting of the}} American Institute of Architects, the structure was criticized as supremely ugly during a plenary address by New York City architect George <b>B.</b> <b>Post.</b> That same year, Senator Joseph Roswell Hawley called it [...] "a cross between a cathedral and a cotton mill". By the time it opened, the building was also too small to accommodate the government agencies which occupied it. The city postmaster had advocated a building with a [...] footprint, but only [...] were purchased. The post office used the main floor and mezzanine, but these were already too crowded by January 1900. Treasury Department offices were to have taken over the eighth floor, but the structure was so overcrowded that this move was suspended.|$|E
2500|$|Robertson {{was born}} in Philadelphia of Scottish parents. His father was Archibald Robertson. He was educated in Scotland, then {{graduated}} from Rutgers College in 1869. He apprenticed for several years in Philadelphia with Henry A. Sims, then moved to New York to work first for George <b>B.</b> <b>Post,</b> then in 1873-74 for Edward Tuckerman Potter. [...] Having completed {{one of the first}} houses in America that manifested the [...] "Queen Anne style", a cottage for Theodore Timson in Sea Bright, New Jersey (1875), he formed a partnership with Potter's half-brother, William Appleton Potter, who also trained with Post. The partnership lasted from 1875 to 1881, working in a free Gothic Revival style; Robertson, the junior partner, appears to have been responsible for the firm's residences. In the 1880s, working on his own, he fell under the influence of H.H. Richardson's [...] "Richardsonian Romanesque" [...] a freely-handled revival style that depended for its effect on strong massing and the bold use of rustication. In the 1890s, {{in the wake of the}} [...] "White City" [...] of the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, he began to work in a classicizing style.|$|E
