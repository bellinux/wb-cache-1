50|$|Vacuum {{furnaces}} is {{a relatively}} economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot be brazed in atmosphere furnaces. Vacuum brazing is also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to atmosphere furnaces. Due {{to the absence of}} flux or a reducing atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when <b>brazing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>a</b> study of <b>vacuum</b> brazing {{of two or}} more {{workpieces}} made of tool steel using <b>a</b> thin foil. <b>In</b> the first part the problem is described and some fundamentals of vacuum <b>brazing</b> are given. <b>In</b> the second part the experimental procedure used in this paper is described. In the present study, specimens of tool steel were used. The specimens, between which a thin nickel-base foil of 0, 05 mm in thickness was inserted, were pressed together in different ways while they were being <b>brazed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> furnace. The pressing force varied during the experimental work. At the end findings, conclusions, and guidelines for future work are given. It was found that the pressing force between two workpieces has a major influence on the vacuum brazing process and properties of a brazed joint...|$|R
50|$|Because the {{induction}} heating cycle is very short {{in comparison to}} flame brazing, more parts can be processed in {{the same amount of}} time, and less heat is released to the surrounding environment.“An induction brazing system quickly delivers highly localized heat to minimize part warpage and distortion. <b>Brazing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> controlled <b>vacuum</b> or <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inert protective atmosphere can significantly improve overall part quality and eliminate costly part cleaning procedures” (Induction Atmospheres, 1).|$|R
40|$|The RF Technology Development {{group at}} Fermilab is working {{together}} with the NLC and GLC groups at SLAC and KEK on developing technology for room temperature X-band accelerating structures for a future linear collider. We built six 60 -cm long, high phase advance, detuned structures (HDS or FXB series). These structures have 150 degrees phase advance per cell, and are intended for high gradient tests. The structures were <b>brazed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> furnace with <b>a</b> partial pressure of argon, rather than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen atmosphere. We have also begun to build 60 -cm long, damped and detuned structures (HDDS or FXC / FXD series). We have built 5 FXC and 1 FXD structures. Our goal was to build six structures for the 8 -pack test at SLAC {{by the end of}} March 2004, as part of the GLC/NLC effort to demonstrate the readiness of room temperature RF technology for a linear collider. This paper describes the RF structure factory infrastructure (clean rooms, vacuum furnaces, vacuum equipment, RF equipment etc.), and the fabrication techniques utilized (the machining of copper cells / couplers, quality control, etching, vacuum brazing, cleanliness requirements etc.) for the production of FXB and FXC / FXD structures...|$|R

Resistance spot-welding is employed to position and align the parts and to establish a suitable faying surface gap for brazing; it contributes {{to the integrity of}} the joint. Brazing enhances the properties of the joint and reduces the stress concentrations normally associated with spotwelds.

40|$|ABSTRACT: ER gel {{exhibits}} various adhesive characteristics {{according to}} the applied electric field. This characteristic is called the EA effect. The results of a recent study reveal that the EA effect also occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Therefore, {{it is expected that}} ER gel can be applied to a chucking or damping device <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> process. However, the characteristics of ER gel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> have not been sufficiently clarified. The {{purpose of this study is}} to experimentally evaluate the characteristic of ER gel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The performance of an ERG fixture element used for <b>a</b> silicon wafer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> is evaluated through shearing tests. The experimental results indicate that the ER gel demonstrates satisfactory performance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Moreover, the outgas released from the ER gel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> is evaluated, and the influence of the degassing time on the outgas is investigated.
