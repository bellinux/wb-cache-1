5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird</b> and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird</b> is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red.

500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, great kiskadee, green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird.</b> [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 538 million blackbirds and Starlings {{are found}} in the United States, based on the national cooperative blackbird/Starling winter roost survey conducted by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service during the 1974 - 75 winter period of December 20 -February 15. Ap- proximately 74 % or 398 million of these blackbirds and Starlings occurred in the Eastern States, including the tier from Minnesota to Louisiana; 26 % or 139 million birds were in the West. The national roosting population in 1974 - 75 was composed of 11 species (Table 1) in the following approximate proportions: 38 % Red-winged Blackbirds; 22 % Common Grackles; 20 % Starlings; 18 % Brown-headed Cowbirds; 2 % Brewer’s Blackbirds; and less than 1 % six species combined (Rusty Blackbirds, Boat-tailed Grackles, Great-tailed Grackles, Tri-colored Black- birds, Yellow-headed Blackbirds, and <b>Bronzed</b> <b>Cowbirds).</b> (Some 2 million robins also were reported in the 1974 - 75 survey, though not solicited and therefore not tabulated, from 20 of the blackbird roosts in the Southeast.) The 1974 - 75 species proportions are similar to those found in the last nationwide winter survey (1969 - 70). In the 1963 - 64 national winter survey, Redwings made up 33 % and Common Grackles 31 % of the total population...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{detailed}} description of the breeding biology of White-eared Groundsparrows (Melozone leucotis), a little-studied Neotropical songbird that inhabits thickets in Central America. Based on eight years of data collected from populations in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, we describe White-eared Ground-sparrows 2 ̆ 7 nests, eggs, nest parasitism, parental behavior, and breeding phenology. Nests conformed to one of two general types: (1) a bulky structure of plant fibres with a coarse outer layer and a fine inner layer; and (2) a smaller, simpler structure made up of a platform of thin plant fibres placed on top of rocks. Nest of the former type were located in vegetation near the ground, whereas the latter type were constructed directly on the ground. This is the first description of the second nest type. Eggs had a white background with variable brown spotting. Eggs were laid in clutches of two or three. Parasitism by <b>Bronzed</b> <b>Cowbirds</b> (Molothrus aeneus) was severe; five often nests were parasitized, including two that were multiply parasitized with 6 and 7 cowbird eggs. Only females were observed incubating the eggs, but both sexes provisioned nestlings; only females were observed provisioning fledglings while males assisted in locating food. This species has a long breeding season, begins in March (late dry season), and continues until September (late rainy season). We provide the first formal description of the breeding behaviour of White-eared Ground-sparrows, from a genus of birds whose behaviour is poorly known in the tropics. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society...|$|R
40|$|The 1969 - 70 {{nationwide}} winter {{inventory of}} blackbird-starling roosts and populations was {{conducted during the}} period December 20 -January 31 by the Division of Wildlife Research, U. S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. The Patuxent Wildlife Research Center coordinated the survey for the East (31 States), and the Denver Wildlife Research Center for the West (17 States). Success depended on extensive cooperation from many sources: Bureau agencies, especially the Division of Wildlife Services; other Federal and State conservation and agricultural departments; the Audubon Society; ornithological clubs; and individual bird students. In all, 674 roosts were reported-— 262 in the East and 412 in the West. The total estimated population was 340 million birds: 267 million blackbirds and starlings in the East and 73 million in the West. The national population was composed of 10 species, about as follows: 40 percent red-winged blackbirds, 20 percent starlings, 20 percent common grackles, 15 percent brown-headed cowbirds, 3 per¬cent Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s blackbirds, and 1 percent rusty blackbirds; the other 1 percent included boat-tailed grackles, yellow-headed blackbirds, tricolored blackbirds, and <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbirds.</b> Of the 262 roosts reported in the East, 77 were classed as major (a million or more birds each) and 57 as large (hundred thousand—million birds each); these 134 roosts contained 265 million of the 267 million blackbirds and starlings reported in the East. Of the 412 roosts in the West, 24 were major and 41 were large; these 65 roosts contained 70 of the 73 million Western birds reported. Thus, 98 ½ percent of the U. S. blackbirds and starlings found were in 199 roosts (101 major roosts and 98 large roosts), or in 30 percent of the 674 reported roosts...|$|R

The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
50|$|They {{are rarely}} victims of cowbird parasitism. LeConte's thrasher has been {{recorded}} being victimized by the <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird</b> in a least one instance, but not by the brown-headed cowbird. However, when 11 brown-headed cowbird eggs {{were placed in the}} thrasher's nest in an experiment, they were accepted.|$|E
50|$|The nest, {{built by}} the female, is a neat lined cup {{constructed}} less than 2 m up in a bush or large tussock. The female lays a clutch {{of two or three}} ruddy-blotched white eggs, which she incubates for 12-14 days. The male helps in feeding the chicks. This species is sometimes parasitised by the <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The male <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird</b> is 20 cm {{long and}} weighs 68 g, with green-bronze glossed black plumage. Their eyes are red in {{breeding}} season and brown otherwise. The female is 18.5 cm long and weighs 56 g. She is a dull black with a brown underbelly, and has brown eyes. Young birds have coloring {{similar to the}} females, {{with the exception of}} grey feather fringes.|$|E
50|$|The deep cup nest is made {{of plant}} fibre and mosses, and placed 2 - 4.5 m high in a crevice in a tree trunk or earth bank. Nests are often in moss near streams. The typical clutch is two or three white eggs, marked with pale rufous speckles. Incubation by the female is 14-15 days to hatching, with another 17 days to fledging. They accept the eggs of brood parasites, and are {{therefore}} occasionally hosts of the <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird.</b> Yellowish flycatchers are active birds, usually seen alone when not breeding.|$|E

50|$|It {{builds a}} heavy cup nest of grass, moss, feathers,leaves and mud on a firm support above the ground, which may include human constructions such as windowsills. It lays 2 to 4 pale blue eggs with red-brown and gray {{markings}} between March and July and may double-brood. It is aggressive {{in defense of}} its nest, having been known to mob raptors as large as golden eagles, but is not otherwise particularly territorial. Aggressive defense against brood parasites may explain why it has not evolved complete recognition of brood parasite eggs; {{it is one of}} only very few species of birds that are partial ejectors, with only about 25% of individuals ejecting parasitic eggs of the <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The nest is a bulky cup {{placed in}} thick low or {{mid-height}} vegetation {{and made of}} materials such as twigs, straws, and grasses. The female lays 2 to 5 eggs described as bluish-white with dense reddish-brown and gray speckles; the appearance is indistinguishable from the brown thrasher. Most of the egg laying for the long-billed in Texas occurs in April and May, and May and June in Mexico, though dates have been as late as June and July, respectively. The eggs hatch {{over a period of}} 24 days. Unlike most thrashers, however, the hatching process is synchronous. Both parents are responsible for incubation, which lasts 13 or 14 days as well as feeding the fledglings. They are rarely victims of brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird or <b>bronzed</b> <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
40|$|I {{studied the}} {{breeding}} biology and nesting {{ecology of the}} Altamira Oriole (Icterus gularis) and Northern Beardless-Tyrannulet (Camptostoma imberbe), two songbirds inhabiting remnant tracts of Tamaulipan brushland of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas during 2002 - 2003. I found 76 active oriole nests, 7 of which were reused for second broods, {{for a total of}} 83 nesting attempts. I estimated that nearly 20 % of the oriole breeding population were subadult, or second-year orioles, which is extremely rare for this species. Oriole breeding pairs were found in high densities and may be at their highest level at the study sites since the 1970 s. Fifty-nine percent of oriole nests fledged, and 37 % failed. Six nests produced <b>Bronzed</b> <b>Cowbird</b> (Molothrus aeneus) fledglings. Vegetation analysis suggests that orioles prefer the tallest trees at the sites in which to place their nests. A greater number of fallen logs near the nest was also a predictor of nest sites, which suggests that orioles prefer scattered woodlands, but also that many of the forests probably continue to shift to a more open, thorn-scrub climax stage. I monitored 28 Northern Beardless-Tyrannulet nests, which were restricted to a smaller number of study tracts than Altamira Orioles. Historical records are lacking for Northern Beardless-Tyrannulets at these sites, but my surveys indicated that there were similar seasonal numbers of tyrannulets at some of the study sites as there were during 1996 - 1998. Forty-three percent of nests were successful and 57 % failed. Higher abundances of epiphytic Spanish moss (Bromeliaceae: Tillandsia usneoides) and ball moss (Bromeliaceae: Tillandsia recurvata) were the most important predictors of nest sites. The continued existence of these two species in South Texas will depend upon the preservation of tall forests, {{and in the case of}} the tyrannulet, forests rich in Tillandsia epiphytes...|$|E
