Some of their confiscated land as well as the Bagh Durbar was also returned. Upon his release, the soldiers loyal to Bhimsen crowded <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> jubilation and followed him up to his house; a similar treatment was given to Mathabar Singh and Sherjung Thapa. Although pardon had been granted to Bhimsen, his former office was not re-instated; thus he went to live in retirement at his patrimony in Borlang, Gorkha.|$|E

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E

5|$|In Gay's {{final year}} as an amateur athlete he started well, setting a {{personal}} best and school record of 6.55s in the 60m at the 2005 Championship Series. He helped the university team to another NCAA outdoor victory, setting a new personal best of 19.93s in the 200m qualifiers and placing third in the finals. Training partner and friend Wallace Spearmon took first place with 19.91s—his time and Gay's 19.93s were the second and third-fastest 200m times {{in the world that}} year. The pair teamed up for the 4 x 100m relay, along with Michael Grant and Omar Brown, and won with an Arkansas-record-breaking time of 38.49s. With the NCAA Championships <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> June 2005 Gay decided to become a professional athlete, setting his sights on a place in the US 200m team for the Helsinki World Championships.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m {{backstroke}}, 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his judgment and race strategy.|$|E
5|$|Once inside, Roy {{is shown}} the true history of The Scouring. The dragons, despite their power, {{were unable to}} {{maintain}} their numbers due to how slowly they reproduced compared to humans. As the war came to a close, the surviving Fire Dragons captured a Divine Dragon named Idunn and sealed away her soul. Enslaved to their will, Idunn reproduced dragons at an incredible rate and {{became known as the}} Demon Dragon, but she was defeated by a warrior wielding the Binding Blade. Her power was locked away until Zephiel, disgusted at humanity's failings, released her out of his insane desire to return Elibe to the dragons. As she has no emotion or free will, Idunn continues to follow Zephiel's orders even after his death and threatens to raise a dragon army that will destroy everything on the continent. On the topmost floor of the temple, the Etrurian Army battles Idunn's endlessly spawning dragons, allowing Roy to deliver the final blow on her with the Binding Blade. This does not kill her, and Roy carries her out as the temple collapses <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> the war's wake, Elibe begins to rebuild itself. Guinivere is named the new ruler of Bern, while Elffin returns to Etruria after his long absence. Roy and Lilina become the new marquesses of Pherae and Ostia, while Idunn is taken to Arcadia and lives with Fae as her soul slowly returns to her.|$|E

5|$|The twin pylons rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E
