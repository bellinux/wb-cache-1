Two extant families (Meinertellidae and Machilidae) consisted of approximately 500 species.

In order to estimate archaeognathan evolutionary relationships, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using concatenated nucleotide sequences of 13 protein-coding genes, with four different computational algorithms (NJ, MP, ML and BI).

40|$|The sperm {{structure}} of the jumping <b>bristletail</b> Machilontus sp has been described. The species shares several sperm characteristics with other genera of the same order Archaeognatha. During late spermiogenesis the spermatid bends at half of its length with the two limbs closely apposed within the same plasma membrane. The sperm has a helicoidal bi-layered acrosome with a filamentous perforatorium and a long nucleus. The elongated flagellum consists of an axoneme with 9 accessory microtubules external to the 9 + 2, two rows of conventional mitochondria and two accessory bodies. The accessory bodies are located lateral to the axoneme and are probably responsible for the shifting of the accessory tubules in two opposite groups of 5 and 4 tubules, respectively. These sperm characteristics represent common traits of all Archaeognatha. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This work aims {{to provide}} a first {{detailed}} description of the results obtained in a seasonal abundance study of arthropods in the native pristine humid forest from Terceira Island (Azores). Ten sites were sampled during four years with SLAM (Sea, Land, and Air Malaise) traps targeting several arthropod taxa with good dispersal abilities as well as epigean species crawling into the trap. Samples were taken every three months in nine sites between 2012 and 2016 and monthly in one of the sites between 2014 and 2015. A total of 147 arthropod species and morphospecies were sampled mostly belonging to Hemiptera, Araneae and Coleoptera. Four endemic species, the tree lace-hopper Cixius azoterceirae, the capsid bug Pinalitus oromii, the <b>bristletail</b> Trigoniophthalmus borgesi and a morphospecies of Aleyrodidae accounted for 50 % of all adult specimens. Most species peak in abundance in summer, but monthly data allowed the identification of other seasonal patterns.

40|$|Different {{species of}} the <b>bristletail</b> genus Lcpismachilis were {{collected}} in 14 localities in Italy and Spain and an allozyme electrophoretic survey was carried out to estimate the degree of genetic variability and differentiation at intra- and interspecific levels. Four morphological species were initially identified (L. osellaii, L. y-signata, L. affinis, L. targionii), but the electrophoretic analysis demonstrated the presence of two additional species among the individuals of L. targionii (Lepismachilis spl and sp 2). The validity of these species and their differentiation from L. targionii were demonstrated by the fixation of alternative allelic patterns at several loci (7 in Lepismachilis spl and 8 in Lepismachilis sp 2), coupled with fixed, previously undetected, morphological differences. In addition, Lepismachilis sp 2 was sympatric with L. targionii in three collecting sites, where the fixation of alternative allelic patterns unequivocally demonstrated reproductive isolation. Genetic variability {{did not seem to}} be correlated with local ecological factors, and differences between species should rather be explained by different historical factors. Low levels of gene flow, estimated with two different indirect methods, were observed in L. tagionii and L. y-signata, and were due to high levels of structuring among populations. Genetic differentiation among conspecific populations was not correlated to their geographical arrangement and the presence of loci fixed for different alleles among them suggested that stochastic factors (such as genetic ddl) may have played a role in determining genetic differentiation of geographically isolated populations. Genetic divergence values indicated that the six species are well differentiated and allozyme profiles were diagnostic for all of them. On the other hand, allozyme data did not provide adequate information to resolve evolutionary relationships among the species, nor did they confirm the validity of the two subgenera (Lepismachilis and Berlesilis) in which the genus Lepismachilis is traditionally divided...|$|E

40|$|Directed aerial descent (i. e. gliding and manoeuvring) {{may be an}} {{important}} stage in the evolution of winged flight. Although hypothesized to occur in ancestrally wingless insects, such behaviour is unexplored in extant basal hexapods, but has recently been described in arboreal ants. Here we show that tropical arboreal <b>bristletails</b> (Archaeognatha) direct their horizontal trajectories to tree trunks in approximately 90 per cent of falls. Experimental manipulation of the median caudal filament significantly reduced both success rate (per cent of individuals landing on a tree trunk) and performance (glide index) versus controls. The existence of aerial control in the ancestrally wingless <b>bristletails,</b> and its habitat association with an arboreal lifestyle, are consistent with the hypothesis of a terrestrial origin for winged flight in insects...|$|R
50|$|The Meinertellidae are a {{small family}} of basal insects {{belonging}} to the order Archaeognatha.

50|$|The name Apterygota is {{sometimes}} {{applied to a}} subclass of small, agile insects, distinguished from other insects by their lack of wings {{in the present and}} in their evolutionary history; notable examples are the silverfish, the firebrat, and the jumping <b>bristletails.</b> Their first known occurrence in the fossil record is during the Devonian period, 417-354 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Monura is an extinct {{order of}} {{wingless}} insects in the subclass Apterygota.

5000|$|The Archaeognatha are {{an order}} of apterygotes, known by various common names such as jumping <b>bristletails.</b> Among extant insect taxa they {{are some of the}} most {{evolutionarily}} primitive; they appeared in the Middle Devonian period at about the same time as the arachnids.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} insect forms showed direct development (ametabolism), and {{the evolution}} of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous [...] "true insects" [...] are still present today, such as <b>bristletails</b> and silverfish. Hemimetabolous insects include cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all insects in the Pterygota undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have hemimetabolous development, and undergo an incomplete or partial metamorphosis, or holometabolous development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, including a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.|$|R
5000|$|The Machilidae are {{a family}} of insects {{belonging}} to the order Archaeognatha (the <b>bristletails).</b> There are around 250 described species worldwide. These insects are wingless, elongated and more or less cylindrical with a distinctive humped thorax and covered with tiny, close-fitting scales. The colour is usually grey or brown, sometimes intricately patterned. There are three [...] "tails" [...] {{at the rear of}} the abdomen: two cerci and a long central epiproct. They have large compound eyes, often meeting at a central point. They resemble the silverfish and the firebrat, which are from a different order, Zygentoma.|$|R
40|$|Diplura (two-pronged <b>bristletails)</b> {{are key to}} our {{understanding}} of hexapod head evolution. A sister group relationship with Ectognatha (=Insecta), comprising <b>bristletails,</b> silverfish and winged insects, is advocated in most modern studies, however, homologization of head muscles and endoskeletal elements between Diplura and Ectognatha is still lacking. Here, we present the first homologization of a number of head muscles and endoskeletal structures between Diplura and Ectognatha. A homologization of these structures is possible if a range of species, both from Japygidae and Campodeidae, are studied in order to reconstruct the potential groundplan characteristics and account for inner anatomy variations within Diplura. Japygidae and Campodeidae show differences in the origin, insertion, and presence of mandibular and maxillary muscles as well as the shape of the maxillary cardo. Taking into account recent embryological studies on the formation of the endoskeleton in Protura, Collembola and Diplura, we furthermore reconstruct the potential evolution of the endoskeleton in early Hexapoda. The tentorium is a defining feature of dicondylic insects (including Archaeognatha) while anterior and posterior cephalic invaginations (the later tentorial pits of dicondylic insects) are groundplan features of Hexapoda. Additionally, we clarify the composition of the gnathal pouches (i. e. the type of entognathy) in Diplura and Collembola. The pouches in Diplura are posteriorly separated, similar to the state encountered in Collembola. This contrasts to former studies emphasizing the differences in the ellipuran and dipluran type of entognathy...|$|R
25|$|The {{subclass}} Apterygota (wingless insects) is {{now considered}} artificial as the silverfish (order Thysanura) are {{more closely related to}} Pterygota (winged insects) than to <b>bristletails</b> (order Archaeognatha). For instance, just like flying insects, Thysanura have so-called dicondylic mandibles, while Archaeognatha have monocondylic mandibles. The reason for their resemblance is not due to a particularly close relationship, but rather because they both have kept a primitive and original anatomy in a much higher degree than the winged insects. The most primitive order of flying insects, the mayflies (Ephemeroptera), are also those who are most morphologically and physiologically similar to these wingless insects. Some mayfly nymphs resemble aquatic thysanurans.|$|R
40|$|Cyrba algerina is a salticid (Salticidae) spider {{that lives}} on the undersides of stones. Two populations were studied, Sintra and Algarve (Portugal), and shown to have similar {{phenology}} but different dominant prey. Life cycle in the laboratory was similar for the two populations, but Sintra matured at larger size than Algarve individuals, with these differences potentially having a genetic basis. Sintra individuals used prey-specific prey-capture behaviour against allopatric (Oecobius amboseli) and sympatric (O. machadoi, Trachyzelotes bardiae) spider and insect (<b>bristletails)</b> species. In contrast, Algarve C. algerina only adopted specialised capture behaviour against <b>bristletails.</b> Sintra, but not Algarve, individuals responded to the odour of O. machadoi and T. bardiae, and showed preference for T. bardiae over O. machadoi. Interpopulation variation {{in the use of}} specific prey-capture behaviour and in sensitivity to odour cues from prey {{is directly related to the}} prey available to individuals from each population, suggesting local adaptation to local prey. Preference for oecobiids seems to be controlled by an experiencetriggered developmental switch. The optics and histology of C. algerina’s principal eye suggest that living in a microhabitat with dim ambient light has favoured sensitivity at the expense of spatial acuity. Short focal length, reduced power of the eye’s diverging lens, and wide, contiguous rhabdomeres, seem to minimise the visual constraints imposed by the low light levels in C. algerina’s microhabitat. While relying solely on vision, C. algerina can detect, identify and capture prey in dim-light conditions under which other salticids perform poorly. C. algerina’s behaviour suggest use of temporal summation to improve its visual performance in dim light...|$|R
25|$|Generally, {{the first}} seven {{abdominal}} segments of adults (the pregenital segments) are similar in structure and lack appendages. However, apterygotes (<b>bristletails</b> and silverfish) and many immature aquatic insects have abdominal appendages. Apterygotes possess a pair of styles; rudimentary appendages that are serially homologous with the distal part of the thoracic legs. And, mesally, one or two pairs of protrusible (or exsertile) vesicles on at least some abdominal segments. These vesicles are derived from the coxal and trochanteral endites (inner annulated lobes) of the ancestral abdominal appendages. Aquatic larvae and nymphs may have gills laterally on some to most abdominal segments. Of {{the rest of the}} abdominal segments consist of the reproductive and anal parts.|$|R
500|$|In the {{broadest}} circumscription, Insecta sensu lato consists of all hexapods. Traditionally, insects defined {{in this way}} were divided into [...] "Apterygota" [...] (the first five groups in the table) – the wingless insects – and Pterygota – the winged insects. However, modern phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} [...] "Apterygota" [...] is not monophyletic, and so does not form a good taxon. A narrower circumscription restricts insects to those hexapods with external mouthparts, and comprises only the last three groups in the table. In this sense, Insecta sensu stricto is equivalent to Ectognatha. In the narrowest circumscription, insects are restricted to hexapods that are either winged or descended from winged ancestors. Insecta sensu strictissimo is then equivalent to Pterygota. For the purposes of this article, the middle definition is used; insects consist of two wingless taxa, Archaeognatha (jumping <b>bristletails)</b> and Zygentoma (silverfish), plus the winged or secondarily wingless Pterygota.|$|R
50|$|NUMTs {{offer an}} unparalleled {{opportunity}} to study ancient diversity of mitochondrial lineages and to discover prehistoric interspecies hybridization. Ancient hybridization have been first detected (using NUMTs) in <b>bristletails,</b> then in columbine monkeys, and, most recently, in a direct human ancestor. The hominid hybridization happened {{about the time of}} human/chimpanzee/gorilla separation. This latter study concerns a human NUMT shared with chimpanzee and gorilla. Joint phylogeny of the three NUMT sequences and the mitochondrial genomes of great apes implies that a common ancestor of the three NUMTs has been transferred to human/chimp/gorilla lineage from a hominid species separated from them by about 4.5 million years of mtDNA evolution. While hybridization of this magnitude is not unheard of among primates, its occurrence in the direct human lineage, around the critical time of human/ape speciation, is a startling result. Additional NUMTs with similar phylogenies indicate that such events may be not unique.|$|R
