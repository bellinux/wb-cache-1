5|$|In {{addition}} to the differences mentioned above, numerous other, local modifications of the structure, harmony or texture were applied to the original material.

5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with <b>bolder</b> fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with <b>bolder</b> dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got <b>bolder</b> in the sense that they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronometer}} {{was returned}} to Greenwich 6 February 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing. It did not come back to Greenwich for nearly two years. On 4 March 1828 it was issued to Captain J. <b>Bolder</b> in command of HMS Hecla. At this time Hecla was a famous ship: {{under the command of}} George Francis Lyon she had been part of Parry's second expedition to find the Northwest Passage. Over 6,000 members of the public visited the ship at Deptford while she waited to set out on Parry's third expedition in 1824. The attempt was abandoned in 1825 after the leading ship, HMS Fury was abandoned due to ice damage. Parry used Hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach the North Pole. Parry unwillingly gave up Hecla when the admiralty sent her to survey the West African coast under the command of <b>Bolder.</b> In July 1830 the chronometer was returned from Hecla and went for cleaning to Robert Molyneux in London. It {{was returned to}} Greenwich in November but not immediately issued to another ship.|$|E

5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make <b>bolder</b> and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|The Echo {{moved from}} Bridge Street to a {{purpose-built}} newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought {{an end to}} the traditional methods of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw the Echo become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw a change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, <b>bolder</b> typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E
5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} {{the portal}} {{until they could}} transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The raiding party brought back samples of good food and fine worksmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and <b>bolder,</b> until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the Humans had not discovered.|$|E
50|$|Some mathematicians do not {{recognize}} blackboard <b>bold</b> as a separate style from <b>bold.</b> Jean-Pierre Serre uses double-struck letters when writing <b>bold</b> on the blackboard, whereas his published works consistently use ordinary <b>bold</b> for the same symbols. Donald Knuth also prefers boldface to blackboard <b>bold,</b> and consequently did not include blackboard <b>bold</b> in the Computer Modern fonts he created for the TeX mathematical typesetting system.|$|R

5|$|The {{settlements}} at Tilsit gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One {{of his major}} objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew <b>bolder</b> and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the <b>bolder</b> look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E
5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much <b>bolder.</b>|$|E

5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably <b>bolder</b> than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and <b>bolder</b> in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E
5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew <b>bolder.</b> Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
50|$|The vixen sees <b>Bold</b> again a {{month later}} and tells him she wants to hunt with him, and this time <b>Bold</b> does not refuse. Together they catch some rats and <b>Bold</b> calls her Whisper because of her stealth. Whisper offers to let <b>Bold</b> stay in her earth, but {{he goes back to}} his usual home to give one of the rats to Robber. When <b>Bold</b> tells Robber about Whisper, the crow insists that his friend forget their {{agreement}} and go to live in the vixen's earth, which <b>Bold</b> does the following night. <b>Bold</b> is unable to jump the wall to get in, but they find a hole through which he can enter.

5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the <b>bolder</b> oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
5|$|To {{complete}} her {{contract with}} Paramount Pictures, Wong made {{a string of}} B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles which were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be <b>bolder</b> than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939).|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the regular}} front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to {{increase}} their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces. They used shoot-and-scoot tactics, avoiding counter-battery fire and leaving the Italians {{with the impression that}} they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. In response, the General Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison. The Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became <b>bolder.</b> Eventually the South African Air Force (SAAF) committed three Hawker Hart biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and strafe the surrounding roads. In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in Jimma in mid June. Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and were heading southeast to cut the Saïo-Yubdo road. By {{the end of the month}} the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the Didessa River. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo and make a final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the Arbegnoch and the raids from the SAAF further complicated their situation.|$|E
