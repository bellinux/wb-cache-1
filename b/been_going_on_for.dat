5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested {{and a lot of}} money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that {{something had to be done}} to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E

25|$|The Tet Offensive {{was little}} noticed at Con Thien and {{elsewhere}} along the DMZ, rather {{it was just}} the same fighting that had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the previous weeks and months. There was no Tet Truce here, but nor was there a sudden NVA thrust through the DMZ or frontal assault on Khe Sanh that MACV had expected.|$|E
25|$|Many {{examples}} of native {{plants and animals}} taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology.

25|$|Behind {{the scenes}} moves for the Arena's {{disposal}} had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some time. International food retailer and manufacturer, Home & Colonial Stores Ltd were offered {{the site in}} 1957. They took possession {{of the building and}} the adjacent market hall in 1958. Works to convert the Arena to its new use were complete by February 1960. It was henceforth put to use as a food storage facility for the next 20 years until its demolition in 1978.|$|E

By December 22, 2007 the LTTE defences at Uyilankulama and Thampanai were lost to advancing troops of the Sri Lanka Army. On December 29, 2007 the Army overran the LTTE stronghold at Parappakandal, Mannar.|$|E

25|$|The Quebec {{public sector}} teachers' unions oppose {{any form of}} subsidy to private schools. They claim (1) that private schools select only the {{brightest}} and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties; and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector. Private schools usually have teachers who are not unionized, or who belong to associations not affiliated with {{the main body of}} Quebec public sector teachers' unions. The debate over the subsidies has <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several decades.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{course of}} events after a primary {{triangulation}} is to construct a secondary triangulation with sides of a few miles, and then a tertiary triangulation at a parish level to show all significant details. Unfortunately this did not happen because the infilling had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> fifty years of topographic surveying, with maps already published on a county basis. Some of those maps had origins that were connected to the primary triangulation, and some did not. As a result, the county maps were only loosely tied to the principal triangulation and no {{attempt was made to}} revise them.|$|E

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{the masters of}} Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan only, the Safavids had, in fact, won the struggle for power in Persia which had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> nearly a century between various dynasties and political forces following the fragmentation of the Kara Koyunlu and the Aq Qoyunlu. A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ismāil proclaimed most of Persia as his domain, and quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, parts of Georgia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Kuwait, Syria, Dagestan, large parts {{of what is now}} Afghanistan, parts of Turkmenistan, and large chunks of Anatolia, laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the Caucasus and its peoples).|$|E
25|$|By 16:15 {{fighting}} had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> two {{and three}} quarter hours when a squadron of the Wellington Regiment carried out a bayonet charge against a close Ottoman position. It {{was too much for}} the Ottoman units whose fighting strength gave way. They fell back beyond Ayun Kara pursued by rifle and machine-gun fire as neither regiment was in a fit state to follow. The Ottoman 3rd Division left behind some 400 dead in front of the Auckland's position alone; although others have quoted totals of between 150 and 162 Ottoman dead. The New Zealanders captured great numbers of machine-guns (some with prismatic sights) including two Lewis guns. Their casualties numbered 175; three officers and twenty-nine other ranks killed, eleven officers and 132 other ranks wounded with the Auckland Regiment suffering eighty-nine of those casualties.|$|E
25|$|Drum line battles have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years, {{but not in}} a formal, {{competitive}} format. In DrumLine Battle, drum {{lines of}} up to 30 marching members (no grounded percussion) compete in head-to-head judged competition. The competitions may be held either live and face-to-face or online, allowing groups {{from all over the world}} to compete against each other. Judging criteria is not restricted to technical proficiency, but includes showmanship and attitude. In 2014, the drum line from E-Sarn, one of Thailand's top drum and bugle corps, traveled to Indianapolis to compete in the DrumLine Battle contest held during DCI Championship week and defeated the drum lines from 15 U.S. drum corps and marching bands. One of the other 2014 competitors in Indianapolis was the River City Rhythm drum line from Minnesota which transitioned into the River City Rhythm Drum and Bugle Corps and entered into DCI Open Class competition in 2015.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} island {{restoration}} is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, {{such as the}} restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) {{is one of the}} largest in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahe, where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.|$|E
25|$|Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and his Chief of Staff John Harris {{were arrested}} {{at their homes}} at 6:15a.m. on December 9, 2008 by deputies of the United States Marshals Service {{on behalf of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Blagojevich and Harris were each charged with one count of {{conspiracy}} to commit mail and wire fraud and one count of soliciting bribes. The case involved sweeping pay to play and influence peddling allegations, including the alleged solicitation of personal benefit in exchange for an appointment to the United States Senate as a replacement for Barack Obama, who had resigned after being elected President of the United States. United States Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald noted that there had been no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama. The cases are part of a broader federal investigation by Fitzgerald code-named Operation Board Games that had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> three years in which 15 people have been charged by Fitzgerald.|$|E
25|$|Chiume later drew {{attention}} to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating {{their opposition to the}} post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.|$|E
