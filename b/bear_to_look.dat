25|$|Fakhr Al-Din Al-Turaihi, a Muslim {{scholar who}} lived in the 17th Century C.E, {{believed}} that the archangel Gabriel {{is the head of the}} cherubim. A Hadith in Shiite tradition tells us that Muhammad heard cherubs wailing and crying with sympathy for sinners in Heaven during his night journey, known as Isra and Mi'raj. Other traditions say that cherubs are so bright that the light of one of them could suffice the whole world. When Moses asked God to show him his face, he made one of his cherubs shine upon the mountain, shattering it to pieces. According to this tradition, God was showing Moses that since he could not <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a cherub, he would not be able to bear looking at God.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, {{however, the}} taste in French art for a cool and {{classical}} form of Baroque that {{had set in}} from the 1620s was already reducing the appreciation of Bellange, whose reputation continued to fall, along with that of Mannerism in general. For the same reason, there are no artists who {{can be seen to}} have been directly influenced by Bellange's style. Unlike the Dutch and Italians, French artists had no large collection of biographies until {{the latter part of the}} century, but the great print collector Michel de Marolles was aware of 47 or 48 prints by Bellange, most of which were in his collections; these would not be exactly the same as the 47 or 48 in modern works, but very largely so. By the mid-18th century, the great French authority Pierre-Jean Mariette was scornful and dismissive: [...] "Bellange is one of those painters whose licentious manner, completely removed from a proper style, deserves great distrust. It nevertheless had its admirers, and Bellange had a great vogue. ... Several pieces by him are known, which one cannot <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, so bad is their taste". Many biographical compendiums simply omitted him, even as late as the 1920s. Another judgment of 1767 was quoted with approval by A. P. F. Robert-Dumesnil in his biographical dictionary Le Peintre-Graveur Français (1841), complaining that Bellange's etchings had [...] "much more bizarreness than judgment, and very little correctness". However, Robert-Dumesnil did recognise that his style had something in common with the Romantics.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{betrayal}} of the POUMists, the terror and the murder of Nin and Smillie, Orwell had been depressed by {{the attitude of the}} British press. [...] "In Spain ... I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts ... I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various party lines." [...] Carr writes, [...] "He was appalled at the treatment of the May days as a 'Trotskyist Revolt' in papers like the News Chronicle which simply swallowed uncritically the Communist line; or Ralph Bates' report in The New Republic that POUM militiamen were playing football with Fascist troops ... Given this supresio vero by interested parties, how could true history be written? Propaganda would pass as truth; 'facts' could be manipulated. Those who monopolized communication could create their own history after the event—the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Orwell attacked sections of the left wing press for suppressing the truth about Spain, indicting the Communists for instigating a [...] "reign of terror"; and he never forgave Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman who turned down his articles on the Spanish Civil War {{on the grounds that they}} [...] "could cause trouble." [...] Malcolm Muggeridge remembered: [...] "Once when we were lunching at a Greek restaurant in Percy Street he asked me if I would mind changing places. I readily agreed but asked him why. He said that he just couldn't <b>bear</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Kingsley Martin's corrupt face, which, as Kingsley was lunching at an adjoining table, was unavoidable from where he had been sitting before." [...] "Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or 'Trotskyism'," [...] Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.|$|E
