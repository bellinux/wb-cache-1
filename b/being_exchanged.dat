5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks <b>being</b> <b>exchanged</b> between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E
5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon <b>being</b> <b>exchanged</b> for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E

As of 2010, the Westie is the third-most popular breed of terrier in the UK, with 5,361 puppies registered with the Kennel Club. However, this is a decrease in numbers since 2001, when {{it was the most}} popular terrier breed, with 11,019 new dogs registered. The breed's position in the United States is more stable with it remaining in the top third of all breeds since around 1960.

After <b>being</b> <b>exchanged</b> for another officer in 1864, Dow resigned from the military and devoted himself once more to prohibition. He spoke across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain in support of the cause. In 1880, Dow headed the Prohibition Party ticket for President of the United States. After losing the election, he continued to write and speak on behalf of the prohibition movement {{for the rest of his}} life until his death in Portland at the age of 93.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the medieval}} period saw a fresh {{resurgence}} {{in the building of}} keeps in western castles. Some castles continued to be built without keeps: the Bastille in the 1370s, for example, combined a now traditional quadrangular design with machicolated corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls, innovatively, were of equal height to the towers. This fashion became copied across French and in England, particularly amongst the nouveau riche, for example at Nunney. The royalty and the very wealthiest in France, England and Spain, however, began to construct a small number of keeps on a much larger scale than before, in England sometimes termed tower keeps, as part of new palace fortresses. This shift reflected political and social pressures, such as the desire of the wealthiest lords to have privacy from their growing households of retainers, as well as the various architectural ideas <b>being</b> <b>exchanged</b> across the region, despite the ongoing Hundred Years War between France and England.|$|E

40|$|Clifford Geertz {{analyzed}} religious {{change in}} Morocco by developing {{an approach to}} Islam that uses both history and anthropology. His analysis is rooted in his conception of anthropology as a discipline whose focus is culture, a system of meanings through which human <b>beings</b> <b>exchange</b> goods and symbols. In traditional societies, religion has a particular place in this system where it plays a political role of legitimation. European domination provoked change in Morocco, including the decline of sacredness and the triumph of Salafism, a doctrine more appropriate to the national feeling. A post-Geertzian perspective might consider that Salafism, which has become an official doctrine of the postcolonial state, became radicalized while it was providing mass education, giving rise to the Islamist challenge. The decline of sanctity created a void that Islamism filled...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} quasiparticle {{spectrum of}} a ferromagnetic film is investigated {{within the framework}} of the s-f model. Starting from the exact solvable case of a single electron in an otherwise empty conduction band <b>being</b> <b>exchange</b> coupled to a ferromagnetically saturated localized spin system we extend the theory to finite temperatures. Our approach is a moment-conserving decoupling procedure for suitable defined Green functions. The theory for finite temperatures evolves continuously from the exact limiting case. The restriction to zero conduction band occupation may be regarded as a proper model description for ferromagnetic semiconductors like EuO and EuS. Evaluating the theory for a simple cubic film cut parallel to the (100) crystal plane, we find some marked correlation effects which depend on the spin of the test electron, on the exchange coupling, and on the temperature of the local-moment system.

25|$|The {{consolidation}} of Arkansas Post units {{when they reached}} the Army of Tennessee at Tullahoma Tennessee created supernumerary (excess officers without official assignment) officers who returned to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi.

40|$|The {{electronic}} quasiparticle {{structure of}} a ferromagnetic local moment film is investigated {{within the framework of}} the s-f model. For the special case of a single electron in an otherwise empty energy band <b>being</b> <b>exchange</b> coupled to a fully ordered localised spin system the problem can be solved exactly and, for the spin-down electron, some marked correlation effects can be found. We extend our model to incorporate the influence of the surface on the electronic structure. Therefore we modify the hopping integrals in the vicinity of the surface. This leads to the existence of surface states, both for the spin-up and the spin-down spectral density of states. The interplay between the modification of the hopping integrals and the existence of surface states and correlation effects is discussed in detail.
