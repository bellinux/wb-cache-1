Litigation research is a relatively new field of social science application. The most useful methodological approaches to study ongoing litigation are still under development. Quantitative designs have dominated this field to date and typically are used for jury selection (Frederick, 1984; Penrod & Linz, 1986). Quantitative techniques, such as secondary analysis of survey data, have been employed to help create checklist scales to evaluate potential jurors for prejudicial tendencies during voir dire (Abbott, 1987).

Take {{a look at the}} diaries of the world s political leaders chock-a-block with summit meetings, sometimes two in one week. In mid-June 2002, squashed between an environmental summit in Brazil and a richest nation moot, with NEPAD partners, in Canada, was the World Food Summit Five Years Later in Rome, Italy. There, under the absent eye of most northern Heads of State, and with massive (but very porous) security, the leaders of many developing countries, powerless and budget-challenged, reaffirmed the previous summit s pledge in 1996 to halve the number of hungry people in the world within the, by now, next 12 years. Tying up the time of 6, 613 participants, 74 Heads of State or Government, 181 country representatives, 1, 200 civil society people and 1, 601 media representatives (the equivalent of 250 working years), have such summits become exercises in pompous insincerity, or do they have a value? In terms of promises kept, no. The networking, though, driven by the hundreds of southern NGOs that made the journey, was a joy to behold. The rapprochements between NGOs and the World Bank, the furtive search of the life science industrialists and farmers leaders for partnership, the opportunity to coax the EU representative almost to seek forgiveness for subsidised agriculture all these mark a new phase in cooperation which could change the face of ACP agriculture. That makes a summit worthwhile. And it brings out the occasional chance remark that could trigger off quite a debate, such as that by Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen on poverty and hunger: 'What really matters is that people can buy food; where it is produced is not important.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effect of HMO {{penetration}} on physician retirement. STUDY DESIGN: We linked together historical data from the Physician Masterfile of the American Medical Association for successive years to track changes in physicians' activity status between 1980 and 1997. We used a multivariate discrete-time survival model to examine how the probability of physician retirement was affected by the level of HMO penetration in the physician's market area, controlling for other physician and market characteristics. The study population included all active allopathic patient-care physicians in the United States who reached age 55 between the years of 1980 and 1996. The main outcome measure was physician retirements as reported on the Physician Masterfile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HMO penetration had a statistically significant positive effect on the retirement probabilities of generalists and medical/surgical specialists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>s</b> effect on hospital-based specialists and psychiatrists was not significant. For generalists regression-adjusted retirement probabilities were roughly 13 percent greater in high-penetration markets (HMO penetration of 45 percent) than in low-penetration markets (HMO penetration of 5 percent). For medical/surgical specialist s regression-adjusted retirement probabilities were roughly 17 percent greater in high-penetration markets than in low-penetration markets. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that many older physicians have found it preferable to retire rather than adapt their practices to an environment {{with a high degree of}} managed care penetration. Because the number of physicians entering the older age categories will increase rapidly over the next 20 years, the growth of managed care and other influences on physician retirement will play an increasingly important role in determining the size of the physician workforce...|$|E
40|$|Achondritic meteorites are {{a diverse}} group of meteorites that formed by igneous {{activity}} in asteroids. These meteorites can provide important information about early differentiation processes on asteroidal bodies. The howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites, the largest group of achondrites, are the only group of meteorites for which a potential parent body has been identified (4 Vesta) [e. g., 1]. Mesosiderites are stony-iron meteorites composed of roughly equal amounts of metal and silicates and silicates are broadly similar to HED meteorites [2]. They may have been formed by impact-mixing of crustal and core materials of differentiated meteorite parent bodies. Chemical and oxygen isotopic compositional data suggest that the HED meteorites and silicate portions of mesosiderites originated on the same or closely related parent bodies. Pallasites and IIIAB irons also have similar oxygen isotope compositions and have been thought {{to be related to the}} HEDs [3, 4]. However, recent high resolution analyses have shown that pallasites and HED's have different oxygen isotopic values, but mesosiderites and HED s have the same isotope compositions implying a close connection [5]. QUE 93148 is a small (1. 1 g) olivine-rich (mg 86) achondrite that contains variable amounts of orthopyroxenene (mg 87) and kamacite (6. 7 wt% Ni), with minor augite [6]. This meteorite was originally classified as a lodranite [7], <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>s</b> oxygen isotopic composition precludes a genetic relationship to the acapulcoites and lodranites. And also this meteorite has a lower Mn/Mg ratio than any major group of primitive or evolved achondrites and suggested that QUE 93148 may be a piece of the deep mantle of the HED parent body [6]. To better understand the relationship between HED s, mesosiderites and related achondrites, we have measured trace elements in the individual metallic and silicate phases. In this study, abundances of a suite of elements were measured for the unusual mesosiderite RKPA 79015 and a ungrouped achondrite QUE 93148...|$|E

O objetivo do primeiro trabalho foi demonstrar a infesta????o de carrapatos Rhipicephalus Boophilus microplus e o papel importante deste parasita na transmiss??o de theileriose equina. Em cavalos com contato direto com bovinos, a incid??ncia sorol??gica da doen??a foi de 81, 8 %, sendo que em 31, 8 % destes animais se encontrou carrapatos Rhipicephalus Boophilus microplus. Nos equinos sem contato com bovinos, a incid??ncia sorol??gica foi de 12 % e n??o se encontrou carrapatos. Diversos estudos t??m demonstrado a efici??ncia no tratamento da doen??a com dipropionato de {{imidocarb}} em diferentes doses, por??m a toxicidade deste f??rmaco se manifesta em alguns animais. A forma aguda ?? caracterizada por febre, icter??cia e morte. A forma cr??nica ?? descrita por p??lo arrepiado, hiporexia, queda no desempenho em animais atletas e perda de peso. O objetivo do segundo trabalho foi demonstrar a toxicidade e os efeitos metab??licos do dipropionato de imidocarb em duas doses terap??uticas (2 e 4 mg/kg).

The equine theileriosis, {{caused by}} Theileria equi, is an endemic disease of south of Rio Grande do Sul Brazil. There {{are signs that}} tick Rhipicephalus boophilus microplus still transmit that disease and in few time, some studies had experimental demonstrated it. The purpose of the first study {{of this paper was}} to demonstrate the tick infestation and the role of it in the transmission of the disease. In equines with contact directly with cattle, the serum incidence of the disease was 81, 8 % and in this group, 31, 8 % of this horses had tick infestation. In the equines that didn t have contact with cattle, the incidence of the disease was 12 % and no tick was found in this horses. The most efficient drug in the treatment of the disease is imidocarb dipropionate. Many studies had demonstrated different doses and protocols of treatment of the disease and the toxicity of it was obvious. No study had show the sterile of T. equi with this drug, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>s</b> a way to treat the acute disease and to control the chronic theileriosis. The acute form of the disease is seemed with fever, icteric and death. The chronic kind of it is seemed with covered coat, hyporexia, low performance in athlete horses and loss of weight. The goal of the second study of this paper was to show the toxicity and the metabolic effects of imidocarb dipropionate drug into two protocols of treatment (two groups, 2 and 4 mg/kg) in serum positive horses to theileriosis. It was seemed through hepatic and renal profile that 2 mg/kg of the drug have low toxicity. Horses infected with T. equi keep with the disease {{for the rest of your}} lives, and the drug control with imidocarb dipropionate is necessary. The goal of the third study of this paper was to demonstrated, through immunologic test and clinic examination that 2 mg/kg of imidocarb dipropionate monthly can control the chronic disease even in stress situations. One group received monthly, through 6 mouths, 2 mg/kg of imidocarb dipropionate and the other group, once, in the beginning of it, 4 mg/kg.

40|$|It {{might look}} like a {{defensive}} structure against marauding enemies, <b>but</b> in fact <b>it</b> <b>s</b> {{just a way to}} improve yields in your fish-pond. Just place rows of bamboo sticks in the pond about half a metre apart. The sticks serve as a breeding ground for periphyton (algae, bacteria, plankton and other organisms), on which fish thrive well. This cuts down on fish feed, always a considerable expense for fish farmers. In a joint project in south Asia, researchers from the universities of Mangalore (India), Mymensingh (Bangladesh), Stirling (Scotland), and Wageningen (The Netherlands) spent three years studying, improving and standardising the technique. They had encountered it being used by fishermen in open water, such as the lagoons of Côte d Ivoire and Benin, and some Asian rivers. The effect of the sticks varies according to the type of fish. In the trials Indian carp and tilapia performed well, with yields increasing by 70 to 80 %. Other materials can be used as substrates, instead of bamboo. The researchers experimented with sugarcane bagasse, PVC pipes and jute sticks. All led to increased yields but none as much as bamboo. The bamboo can be re-used three to four times. Using rotting material should be avoided as it adversely affects fish production. An extra advantage of the stick-method is that they discourage poachers, since the sticks make it difficult to catch a lot of fish in a short time. The same goes for the fish farmer, who will not easily be able to catch small amounts of fish, but can best remove the sticks at one time and harvest all the fish in one go.

Food delivery occurred 45 s after entering the terminal link with a probability of. 5, but its conditional probability (1. 0 or 0) depended on the combination of the color and the line stimuli. One of the color stimuli occurred independently of further responding, 5 s after entry into the right terminal link, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> occurred 35 <b>s</b> after entry into the left terminal link. One of the line stimuli occurred independently of responding 40 s after entry into either terminal link, synchronized with the offset of the color stimulus. The initial-link relative response rate for the right was consistently higher in comparison with a control condition in which the color stimuli occurred 20 s after entry into either terminal link. The preference for the short delay to the color conditional discriminative stimuli suggests the possibility of conditioned reinforcement by information about the relation between the line conditional discriminative stimuli and the outcomes...|$|R

Chandran who made him speak like his father in that film and made the world sit up and take notice. He later modified himself {{into one of the}} versatile character-actors Tamil industry has ever produced. He made notable performances in films like Vaidegi Kaathirunthal, Uyarntha Ullam, Chinna Thambi, Poo Veli, Uzhaipalli, Guru Sishyan, etc. He has acted in about 280 films in all the South Indian languages - four in Telugu, three in Kannada, three in Malayalam and the others in Tamil. He tried his hands in production with films like Thai Maasam Poo Vasam, Idhu Namma Bhoomi, Chinnamuthu and Ilaignar Ani and Ruthrathandavam. Apart from being a renowned actor, he is an eminent leader and a great personality in society. He heads the Lions Club of Chennai and holds the post of secretary in Nadigar Sangam, which he headed efficiently a few years ago. Years of working towards perfection in acting and being at the helm of everything due to his sense of responsibility has instilled tons of creativity and leadership qualities in him. He has worked in all the four South Indian languages and is still going strong with his versatile performance.|$|R

When AIDS first appeared in the United States, federal funding for AIDS research was a contentious issue due to a perceived connection between AIDS and homosexuality, and homophobic sentiment impeded government action on AIDS until the eventual appearance of AIDS in the heterosexual population removed some of AIDS’s stigma. Then, two decades later, South African President Thabo Mbeki based his nation’s public health response to AIDS on the demonstrably false belief, advocated by the American biologist Peter Duesberg, that HIV was not the cause of AIDS, causing untold damage. This thesis analyzes the social dimensions of the global AIDS epidemic, paying special attention to the pseudoscience that shaped government AIDS policy in South Africa. Through a comparative analysis with other pseudoscientific movements, a taxonomy of pseudoscience is assembled. We see that pseudoscience owes much of its popularity to a mistrust of science and to a perception that scientific consensus is somehow unreliable; additionally, the rise of the internet has facilitated the circulation of pseudoscience and has made it likely that, going forward, pseudoscientific movements will play an increasingly prominent role in debates over, and the formulation of, scientific policy...|$|R

40|$|The Scottish and UK {{economies are}} {{continuing}} to grow and recover from the Great Recession. With growth of 0. 6 % in the final quarter of last year (2014) – the latest data point - the Scottish economy has now enjoyed positive growth for the last 11 quarters (since 2012 q 1) while in the UK, also with growth of 0. 6 % in 2014 q 4, the sustained recovery period has been shorter at 8 quarters. The introduction of {{a new system of}} accounts ESA 2010 has brought in to the production calculus some activities (such as research and development and military expenditure) that were not previously treated as outputs alongside the inclusion of previously uncounted ones (such as illegal activities). In consequence, the nominal value of GDP has risen by around 1 to 4 % per year due to the addition of these new activities within the production boundary. A further consequence of these accounting changes is that the extent of the recovery from recession is now greater in both UK and Scotland <b>but</b> <b>it</b> i <b>s</b> stronger in the UK. When o il and gas production is removed – to compare like with like, since offshore activity is included in the UK but not the Scottish GDP data - we find that the gap in the strength of the recovery widens further in the UK’s favour. UK GDP stands 5. 1 % above the pre -recession peak compared to only 2. 3 % in Scotland. We speculate that the relatively stronger UK recovery under the new accounting system could be due to the recovery in R&D activity being stronger {{in the rest of the}} UK after the recession than in Scotl and and, if so, may not augur well for Scotland’s growth performance in the longer term. However, there may simply be a technical rather than an economic cause due, for example, to different sub-sectoral weights between Scotland and the UK...|$|R
