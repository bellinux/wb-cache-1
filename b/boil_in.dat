25|$|As the Skybolt crisis {{came to the}} <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> the UK, an {{emergency}} meeting between Macmillan and Kennedy was arranged {{to take place in}} Nassau, Bahamas. Accompanying Macmillan were the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Home; Thorneycroft; Sandys; and Zuckerman. Naval expertise was supplied by Vice Admiral Michael Le Fanu. Ormsby-Gore flew to Nassau with Kennedy. En route, he brokered a deal whereby Britain and the United States would continue development of Skybolt, with each paying half the cost, the American half being a kind of termination fee. In London, over one hundred Conservative members of Parliament, nearly one third of the parliamentary party, signed a motion urging Macmillan to ensure that Britain remained an independent nuclear power.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Alan Machado Prabhu, Tipu's {{reasons for}} the captivity were primarily religious. He found the social customs of the Christians distasteful, such as their fondness for pork and the social acceptance of alcohol.

As evidence of this, Prabhu states that Tipu does not mention a large scale Christian conspiracy in his writings in the Sultan-ul-Tawarikh, where he justifies his action instead as arising from the [...] "rage of Islam that began to <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> his breast." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{processing}} (<b>boiling</b> <b>in</b> water and steaming) {{on changes in}} dietary fibre fractions and the functional properties of carrot and red beet fibre were studied. <b>Boiling</b> <b>in</b> water caused significantly larger changes in qualitative and quantitative composition of the vegetable fibre than steaming. It was observed that <b>boiling</b> resulted <b>in</b> an increase of the neutral detergent fibre (NDF), cellulose, {{a slight increase in}} lignin content and decrease of hemicellulose. Boiling of these vegetables in water, in comparison to steaming, affected the changes of functional properties of fibre.

500|$|Tipu {{received}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Mangalorean Catholics and their help to the British in the Second Anglo-Mysore War. To minimise the British threat to his kingdom and in the Sultan-ul-Tawarikh, due to [...] "the rage of Islam that began to <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> his breast", Tipu banished the Mangalorean Catholic community from their lands, and imprisoned them at Seringapatam, the capital of his empire. The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history.|$|E
2500|$|Open-cycle OTEC uses warm {{surface water}} {{directly}} to make electricity. The warm seawater is first pumped into a low-pressure container, which causes it to <b>boil.</b> <b>In</b> some schemes, the expanding vapour drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an electrical generator. The vapour, which has left its salt and other contaminants in the low-pressure container, is pure fresh water. It is condensed into a liquid {{by exposure to}} cold temperatures from deep-ocean water. [...] This method produces desalinized fresh water, suitable for drinking water, irrigation or aquaculture.|$|E
2500|$|Organic {{compounds}} typically melt {{and many}} <b>boil.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, while inorganic materials generally can be melted, {{many do not}} boil, tending instead to degrade. [...] In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds. [...] The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight. [...] Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, sublime, that is they evaporate without melting. [...] A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is para-dichlorobenzene, the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs. [...] Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300°C, although some exceptions exist.|$|E

On August 6, 1855, [...] "Bloody Monday" [...] erupted, in which Protestant mobs bullied {{immigrants}} away from the polls and began rioting in Irish and German neighborhoods. Protestant mobs attacked and killed at least twenty-two people. The rioting began at Shelby and Green Street (Liberty) and progressed through the city's East End. After burning houses on Shelby Street, the mob headed for William Ambruster's brewery in the triangle between Baxter Avenue and Liberty Street. They set the place ablaze and ten Germans died in the fire. When the mob burned Quinn's Irish Row on the North side of Main between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets, some tenants died in the fire; the mob shot and killed others. The Know-Nothing party won the election in Louisville and many other Kentucky counties.|$|E
2500|$|The natural {{occurrence}} of fermentation means {{it was probably}} first observed long ago by humans. The earliest uses of the word [...] "fermentation" [...] in relation to winemaking was {{in reference to the}} apparent [...] "boiling" [...] within the must that came from the anaerobic reaction of the yeast to the sugars in the grape juice and the release of carbon dioxide. The Latin fervere means, literally, to <b>boil.</b> <b>In</b> the mid-19th century, Louis Pasteur noted the connection between yeast and the process of the fermentation in which the yeast act as catalyst and mediator through a series of a reaction that convert sugar into alcohol.

After it is taken, the vein [...] is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius [...] about to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> vessels of tin , and every hundred amphoræ ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed {{at the end of a}} long funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the colour.|$|E
