40|$|An {{understanding}} of soil fragmentation during aggregate breakdown {{is useful in}} studies of erosion, tillage and traffic. Modelling efforts in soil fragmentation has largely focussed on characterisation of the size and mass distribution of aggregates using fractal approach and less on the nature and magnitude of the applied energy that produces fragmentation. In this paper, we report a model of soil fragmentation that assumes soil to comprise two fractions: a strongly <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> (primary particles) and a weakly <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> (aggregates). As the energy input on the soil increases, fragmentation {{of some of the}} weakly <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> produces an increase in the amount of primary particles. For simplicity, only three size classes of primary particles (sand, silt and clay) are considered. Results show that the model can be applied to soils {{of a wide range of}} structures and is capable of producing improved description of aggregate hierarchy. Application of the model to studies of tillage and erosion is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Lipoprotein[a] or Lp[a] is a cholesterol-rich plasma {{lipoprotein}} that {{is associated}} with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. To better understand this association we determined the amount of apo[a] and apoB as possible estimates for Lp[a] and low density lipoprotein (LDL) accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions and in plasma, from patients undergoing vascular surgery, using specific radioimmunoassays for apolipoprotein[a] and apolipoprotein B. Apo[a] and apoB were operationally divided into a loosely <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> obtained by extracting minced samples of plaque with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a tightly <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> obtained by extracting the residual tissue with 6 M guanidine-HC 1 (GuHCI). We found that 83 % of all apo[a] but only 32 % of all apoB in lesions was in the tightly <b>bound</b> <b>fraction.</b> When normalized for corresponding plasma levels, apo[a] accumulation in plaques was more than twice that of apoB. All fractions of tissue apo[a], loosely bound, tightly bound, and total, correlated significantly with plasma apo[a]. However, no significant correlations were found between any of the tissue fractions and plasma apoB. If all apo[a] and apoB had been associated with intact Lp[a] or LDL particles, the calculated mass of tightly bound Lp[a] would actually have exceeded that of tightly bound LDL in five cases with plasma Lp[a] levels above 5 mg apo[a] protein/dl. When PBS and GuHCl extracts of lesions were subjected to onedimensional electrophoresis, the major band stained for lipid and immunoblotted positively for apo[a] and apoB, suggesting the presence of some intact Lp[a] in these extracts. These results suggest that Lp[a] accumulates preferentially to LDL in plaques, and that plaque apo[a] is directly associated with plasma apo[a] levels and is in a form that is less easily removable than most of the apoB. This preferential accumulation of apo[a] as a tightly <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> in lesions, could be responsible for the independent association of Lp[a] with cardiovascular diseas...|$|E

Rice paddy soil samples routinely undergo oxidation prior to heavy metal analysis. Fraction distribution of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cd from paddy soil with a wide pH range was investigated. Samples were both dried according to standard protocols and also preserved under anaerobic conditions through the sampling and analysis process and heavy metals were then sequentially extracted for the exchangeable and carbonate <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> (acid soluble fraction), iron and manganese oxide <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> (reducible fraction), organic <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> (oxidizable fraction), and residual fraction.

Pbresidual fraction, Niacid soluble fraction, and Cdoxidizable fraction decreased 33 %, 25 %, and 15 %, respectively. Drying paddy soil prior to heavy metal analysis overestimated Pb and underestimated Cu, Ni, and Cd. In future studies, samples should be stored after injecting N 2 gas to maintain the redox potential of soil prior to heavy metal analysis, and investigate the correlation between heavy metal fraction distribution under field conditions and air-dried samples...|$|E

Scatchard analysis of thyrotropin binding to solubilized membranes (SM) yielded a nonlinear plot with Kd values for {{the high and low}} affinity components similar to those of intact membranes. Chromatography of the SM preparation on concanavalin A-Sepharose 4 B resulted in the retention of 10 - 20 % of the binding activity. Upon elution of the column, a peak of binding material (5 - 7 % of total activity) was eluted at 0. 3 M alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. This concanavalin A (Con A) <b>bound</b> <b>fraction</b> exhibited a linear Scatchard plot with a Kd value {{similar to that of the}} high affinity component of the SM. The protein fraction that did not bind to Con A (Con A unbound) also exhibited a linear Scatchard plot, but with affinity similar to that of the low affinity component of SM. Discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation revealed the presence of two major binding peaks in the solubilized membrane preparation. The slowly sedimenting peak corresponded to that seen in the Con A <b>bound</b> <b>fraction,</b> whereas the rapidly sedimenting peak corresponded to that of the Con A unbound fraction. Sepharose 6 B chromatography indicated that in the case of the Con A unbound fraction, a single peak of specific binding activity was eluted in the void volume, and in the case of the Con A <b>bound</b> <b>fraction,</b> one major peak with an approximate Stokes radius of 67 A and several other minor peaks were eluted. These results demonstrate the physical separation of two distinct TSH binding species from thyroid membranes and provide further support for the model of multiple classes of binding sites...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time a liquid {{chromatography}} method with high resolution mass spectrometric detection has been developed for the simultaneous determination all key metabolites of the sulfur pathway in yeast, including all thiolic (cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (HCys), glutathione (GSH), cysteinyl-glycine (Cys-Gly), 3 ̆b 3 -glutamyl-cysteine (Glu-Cys)) and non-thiolic compounds (methionine (Met), s-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet), s-adenosyl-homocysteine (AdoHcy), and cystathionine (Cysta)). The developed assay also permits the speciation and selective determination of reduced, oxidized and protein <b>bound</b> <b>fractions</b> of all of the five thiols. Iodoacetic acid (IAA) was chosen as the derivatizing reagent. Thiols were extracted from sub-mg quantities of yeast using hot 75...|$|R
40|$|Leaves {{and storage}} roots of sweet potato plants (Ipomea batatas) showed the same {{qualitative}} isoperoxidase patterns {{and a similar}} distribution of distinctive isoperoxidases between the cell protoplast and cell wall free, ionically bound, and covalently <b>bound</b> <b>fractions.</b> No changes in the qualitative isoenzyme spectrum were found in relation to age, mechanical injury, or ethylene action. Thus, as in tobacco plants, the cell isoperoxidases in sweet potato did not reflect the possible differential mRNA synthesis in relation to organ, age, or injury. Transcription {{does not seem to}} be a limiting factor in injury- and ethylene-dependent peroxidase enhancement during the first 24 hr...|$|R
40|$|The {{speciation}} {{distribution of}} cadmium (Cd) in mangrove (Kandelia candel (L.) Druce) rhizosphere sediment was investigated after different contents of Cd being loaded. The study {{results indicated that}} root induced changes of Cd bioavailability in the rhizosphere. Exchangeable and carbonate bound Cd in the rhizosphere sediments were lower than these in the bulk sediments, whilst an increase in Fe-Mn oxides bound and O. M/sulfide <b>bound</b> <b>fractions</b> occurred in the rhizosphere sediment. Increased levels of Cd in sediments resulted in higher Cd concentrations in mangrove plants, and the order of accumulation was: roots > hypocotyls > stems and leaves...|$|R
