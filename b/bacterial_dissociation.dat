40|$|The {{principles}} {{upon which}} prophylactic inoculation against typhoid fever is based are unquestionably sound, and {{there can be}} no doubt of the fact that the procedure has considerably diminished the incidence of the disease during the last thirty years. The instances of the failure of antityphoid vaccine to protect against infection are, however, not so rare as to preclude the possibility that some of the vaccines now in use are not as efficient as they should be. Practically all the vaccine used in this country is made from the Rawlins strain of Bacterium typhosum [...] a culture isolated by Sir Almroth Wright in 1903 [...] although our knowledge of <b>bacterial</b> <b>dissociation</b> strongly suggests that such an old culture would by now have become considerably altered in antigenic composition. That rough strains of practically all the pathogenic microorganisms are inferior to the smooth forms as protective antigens has been demonstrated by many different workers.

40|$|In {{experimental}} immunology, it frequently is {{of interest}} to obtain quantitative estimates of the virulence of strains of microorganisms as evidenced by their ability to produce fatal infections in experimental animals. It is recognized that, in the broader sense, virulence is not a specific intrinsic attribute of an organism but {{is the result of}} a combination of a number of factors pertaining to the organism, the affected host, and the conditions (known or unknown) under which the pathological state is established. Nonetheless, when suitable laboratory animals are employed, and when the combination of experimental conditions is propitious, it can be demonstrated with some consistency that even closely related strains of organisms differ in their capability of producing experimental infections. For the purpose of this presentation, such differences in capability can be considered as differences in virulence of the organisms regardless of the true nature of the experimental infective process. Quantitative estimates of virulence have been employed by various workers in studying the relationship of this property to antigenic constitution, <b>bacterial</b> <b>dissociation...</b>|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of a study of P/eiffer baciUi, strains were grown on special {{transparent}} agar and it was observed that when one particular strain was grown in this way two kinds of colonies developed. The colonies of one kind were like those usually described as typical for this organism while the colonies of the other kind were opaque and were very iridescent when viewed by oblique transmitted light. It was also observed that the organisms forming the colonies of one kind differed in morphology from the organisms forming colonies of the other kind (1). Further study indicated that the phenomenon was undoubtedly an example of variation or <b>bacterial</b> <b>dissociation.</b> During recent years much new and important knowledge concerning variations in bacteria of other species has been obtained (2) and it has seemed important to study in greater detail, in the light of this new knowledge, the variations occurring among the so-called influenza bacilli, or Pfeiffer bacilli. The bacteria of this group do no t form a well characterized bacterial species, and it has long been recognized that individual strains differ from one another in morphology and virulence, in the appearance of the colonies which they form, in their ability to form indole, in power to ferment sugar and to induce hemolysis, in their immunological reactions, and even in their requirements for g~owth in artificial cultures. The literature relating to the biological characteristics of the bacteria forming this heterogenous group has been recently reviewed by Jordan (3) and Scott (4). In 1920 the Committee on Nomenclature of the American Association of Bacteriologists (5) proposed the name Hemophilus influenzae for this group of organisms. Soon after this, more accurate studies of the growth requirements of the organisms of this group were made (6, 7, 8). In the present paper the term Hemophilus influenzae is employed to include only those organism...|$|E
40|$|Although the modifying {{effect of}} {{environmental}} factors on <b>bacterial</b> variation (<b>dissociation)</b> {{has been widely}} studied (Braun, 1947), {{there has been a}} paucity of data concerning the influence of the trace metals on this phenomenon. In the course of an investigation of factors that influence variation in Brucella abortu 8, our attention was directed to the possible role of the trace metal ions by the finding that during prolonged growth of smooth cultures of B. abortus in broth no nonsmooth variants (e. g., R, M) could be observed when 0. 03 M Na-pyro-phosphate was added to the medium. In contrast, similar cultures without pyro-phosphate showed a progressive establishment of nonsmooth variants (mutants). Since pyrophosphate forms complexes with many metal ions and is known to inhibit certain enzymes (Sumner and Somers, 1947), the present study was undertaken in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of action of pyrophosphate as well as of trace enetals in bacterial variation.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{adaptation}} of viruses to attack new hosts which originally are resistant greatly widens {{the sphere of}} influence of viruses on bacterial variation and evolution. The viruses attacking diphtheria bacilli are highly specific in their host range activity {{but many of them}} are readily adapted to lyse strains of other serolo-gical types. The range of adaptability of viruses is largely unknown and studies on the specificity and adaptability of bacterial viruses are complicated by the phenome-non of autoadaptability. Although virus-carrying bacterial strains are normally resistant to the viruses with which they are symbiotically infected it is now found that in many cases the viruses can be readily adapted to attack and lyse the parent bacterial cells. This has been found to occur spontaneously in cultures, and accounts for many cases of <b>bacterial</b> variation and <b>dissociation.</b> The existence of closed evolu-tionary chains in lysogenic bacterial strains provides the explanation of many phenomena and difficulties in studies of phage typing and specificity. A further effect of significance in this field is the possibility of obtaining hybrid viruses by genetic recombination between an externally infecting virus and a virus alread...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, {{expression}} of the tif- 1 mutation (in the recA gene) induces the “SOS response” at 40 °C, including massive synthesis of the recA(tif) protein, cell filamentation, appearance of new repair and mutagenic activities, and prophage induction. Expression of the tsl- 1 mutation (in the lexA gene) induces massive synthesis of the recA protein and cell filamentation at 42 °C, although other SOS functions are not induced. In this paper we show that the septation inhibition induced in tif and tsl strains at 42 °C is not due {{to the presence of}} a high concentration of recA protein since (i) no recA mutants (≤ 10 − 8) were isolated among thermoresistant nonfilamenting revertants of a tif- 1 tsl- 1 strain, (ii) in a tsl- 1 zab- 53 strain, only the low basal level of recA protein was synthesized at 42 °C, yet cell division was inhibited, and (iii) in a tsl- 1 recA 99 (amber) strain, no recA protein could be detected at 42 °C, yet cell division was inhibited. Among suppressors of tsl-tif-induced lethality are mutations at a locus which we call infB, located in the 66 - to 83 -min region. The infB 1 mutation confers a highly pleiotropic phenotype, which is suggestive of a regulatory defect; it suppressed tsl-tif-induced filamentation but not recA protein synthesis, it did not suppress ultraviolet-induced filamentation (in a lon derivative), and it reduced but did not abolish tif-mediated induction of λ prophage and <b>bacterial</b> mutagenesis. The <b>dissociation</b> of tsl-tif-induced septation inhibition and recA protein synthesis in the tif- 1 tsl- 1 infB 1 strain suggests that the control of SOS filamentation may not be strictly identical to the control of recA protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} human {{pathogens}} in the family of Chlamydiaceae. Different serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis cause sexually-transmitted disease and eye infections whereas C. pneumoniae (TWAR) is a common cause of community-acquired respiratory infection. Chlamydia species are obligate, intracellular bacteria sharing a unique developmental cycle that occurs within a protected vacuole termed an inclusion. These microorganisms can be distinguished by two different forms: the infectious, metabolically inert elementary body (EB) and the reproducing non-infectious form, termed the reticulate body (RB). The cycle is terminated when re-differentiation of RBs back to infectious EBs occurs. Chlamydia possesses a type III secretion system (T 3 SS) essential for delivery of effector proteins into the host for host-cell interactions. This virulence system has been systematically characterized in several mammalian pathogens. Due to lack of a tractable genetic system for Chlamydia species, we have employed chemical genetics as a strategy to investigate molecular aspects of the T 3 SS. We have identified that the T 3 S-inhibitors INP 0010 and INP 0400 block the developmental cycle and interfere with secretion of T 3 S effector proteins in C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis, without any cytotoxic effect. We have further shown that INP 0010 decreases initiation of transcription in C. pneumoniae during the early mid-developmental cycle as demonstrated by a novel calculation, useful for measurement of transcription initiation in any intracellular pathogen. The mechanism regulating the signal(s) for primary as well as terminal differentiation of RBs has not been defined in Chlamydia. We show using T 3 S-inhibitors that INP 0010 targets the T 3 SS and thereby arrests RB proliferation as well as RB to EB re-differentiation of C. pneumoniae as where INP 0400 targets the T 3 SS and provokes a <b>bacterial</b> <b>dissociation</b> from the inclusion membrane presumed to mimic the natural occurrence of terminal differentiation. The effect of INP 0010 on iron-responsive genes indicates a role for T 3 S in iron acquisition. Accordingly, our results suggest the possibility that C. pneumoniae acquires iron via the intracellular trafficking pathway of endocytosed transferrin. Moreover, we have {{for the first time}} presented data showing generalized bone loss from C. pneumoniae infection in mice. The infection was associated with increased levels of the bone resorptive cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 1 beta. In addition, an increased sub-population of T-cells expressed RANKL during infection. Additionally, C. pneumoniae established an infection in a human osteoblast cell line in vitro with a similar cytokine profile as seen in vivo, supporting a causal linkage. Collectively, these data may indicate a previously unknown pathological role of C. pneumoniae in generalized bone loss...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preceding}} pages we have presented evidence {{which we believe}} furnishes {{new light on the}} disease process in avian tuberculosis. From a well known strain of avian tubercle bacillus, A 1, four variants have been dissociated, each manifesting distinct colony topography and physical and chemical characteristics. From these studies we have learned that the variants are sometimes unstable, not only in vitro but also in vivo, and that this characteristic is one of the prominent factors influencing both the advancement and retrogression of the disease. The four variants remain fairly stable in vitro provided they are cultivated on proper culture media. About 80 per cent smooth S and flat smooth F. S. colonies will develop true to type on egg media; and rough R and the chromogenic Ch when cultivated on gycerine agar media, in about the same percentage. An early non-specific eosinophilia followed inoculation, no matter which variant was used. This usually subsided by the 18 th hour. The early stages of tubercle formation produced by all the variants appeared similar. First there appeared an aggregation of eosinophiles and their ingested bacilli within the tissues and then followed replacement by large mononuclear cells which wandered in and phagocyted both eosinophiles and bacilli. After the formation of tubercles composed only of large mononuclear cells, certain differences between the virulent and avirulent variants became apparent. There was also a direct relationship between the dosage and the extent of the disease. In our experience from 0. 16 to 0. 25 mg. gave the most uniform results. If S variant was used, the early non-specific eosinophilia was followed by a second rise which continued to ascend, running parallel with the total leucocyte count. There was a slow increase of monocytes and a corresponding decrease of lymphocytes. The microscopic lesions, 2 weeks after inoculation, were composed of irregularly shaped clumps of necrosing large mononuclear cells. The margins were clear-cut and bordered by few or no lymphocytic cells. By the 3 rd and 4 th weeks eosinophiles began to migrate into the centers of the tubercles and abscess formation became evident. Death usually occurred after 5 or 6 weeks, although this varied with the dosage. The appearance of the lesions suggested an acute "toxic" nature, as manifested (1) by marked enlargement of the spleen and liver, (2) by the short fatal course of the disease, which never became very extensive, (3) by the presence of few organisms within the tubercles, (4) by destruction of reticulum and (5) by the marked response of the blood leucocytes. After inoculation with F. S. variant the early non-specific eosinophilia disappeared, returning again at the terminal stage, 5 to 6 weeks later. The number of eosinophiles then ascended sharply, accompanied by a marked leucocytosis which continued until death. During this eosinophilia a monocytosis occurred and lymphocytes fell away rapidly. During the 2 nd week, clumps of closely packed large mononuclear cells containing masses of phagocyted bacilli were seen. In the 3 rd and 4 th weeks there appeared a prominent peripheral zone of hyalin, collagenous-like material associated with an increased reticulum formation which apparently walled off the lesion. The bacilli within the tubercle multiplied rapidly, it seemed as though they were more resistant to destruction than the S organisms, perhaps due to their higher lipin content. As a result of their rapid increase, progression of the tubercle continued, with necrosis and abscess formation, accompanied by the dissemination of the organisms both locally and distantly to new uninvolved tissue. Wide extension of the disease followed due to the increase in numbers of bacilli, terminating with death usually during the 5 th and 6 th weeks. The manifestations of "toxin" damage shown in S disease were not so marked until the approach of the end-stage. We interpret the type of lesion produced by the F. S. variant as a foreign body tubercle to distinguish it from the acute "toxic" nature of the S. A quantitative chemical determination showed that this organism contained 20. 14 per cent lipin whereas in the S variant it was only 15. 03 per cent. Following inoculation with R variant the initial eosinophilia returned to normal within 24 hours. There was then an increase of both lymphocytes and monocytes, the latter exceeding the former for a time. Later, usually after the 2 nd month, the lymphocytes again became predominant over the monocytes, approaching the normal base line. Eosinophiles failed to react. This blood picture indicated a successful resistance against the infecting organisms, and was supported by the pathological findings. None of the chickens of this group died during the period of study (79 days) although infecting doses of 0. 25 mg. were used. Necropsies on four chickens revealed no macroscopic evidence of disease approximately 11 weeks after inoculation. Microscopic lesions were present in the spleen and liver of some cases. In chickens inoculated 11 weeks previously these tubercles consisted only of very small, discrete clumps of degenerating mononuclear cells often surrounded by a border of lymphocytes. Necrosis, abscess formation or caseation was not found. Their small size and appearance was evidence of their retrogressive character. Isolated giant cells were rarely seen. It was impossible to find bacilli within these tubercles. In one instance it was possible to show complete innocuousness of this organism in the tissues, as far as producing recognizable tuberculous lesions. Reticulum played little part {{in the development of the}} lesion and it was neither increased or destroyed. Following inoculation with the chromogenic Ch variant the initial eosinophilia declined by the 24 th or 42 nd hour count and from then on remained low. The lymphocytes showed little decrease. A prominent monocytosis of prolonged character usually occurred during the 3 rd to 6 th weeks and was then displaced by a return of the lymphocytes. By the end of the period of observation the differential count had closely approached the normal values. Again the blood picture was truly representative of the relatively benign character of the lesions. The tubercle formation, even after 93 days' duration of the disease, remained limited to small clumps of two or three large mononuclear cells showing some degeneration. Lymphocytic cells were usually present within and about the lesion. There was never any evidence of abscess formation or actual necrosis. Bacilli could not be found within these tubercles. The reticulum in relation to the lesion showed neither increase nor destruction. None of the chickens died though a dose of 0. 5 mg. was used. In three chickens infected with S variant, the blood picture did not follow the pattern set by the others similarly inoculated. Either a high monocytosis replaced the usual eosinophilia, or there was a marked recession of the total leucocyte count followed by a return of lymphocytes towards normal percentage. The blood picture indicated the conversion of an acute process into a subacute or chronic affair. These chickens survived for 78, 79 and 110 days, respectively. An explanation for this occurred to us later when cultures recovered from them, instead of consisting of S colonies, showed the topography of the intermediate type, closely resembling the F. S. type. Evidently this was due to a reversion; i. e., a loss of virulence of the organism occurring within the animal body. At necropsy the spleen and liver were somewhat enlarged and contained prominent, discrete yellow nodules resembling small shot in their size and shape, which, in one case could be lifted from the tissue by the point of the knife. Microscopically, they possessed small centers of caseation surrounded by numerous giant cells and large mononuclear cells with a thick border of lymphocytic cells. This tubercle formation could not be classified in any special group as it was too sharply circumscribed and walled off by lymphocytic cells to be considered as truly malignant in nature as the S type of lesion. Even the younger tubercles in these cases, which consisted of clumped epithelioid cells with prominent lymphocytic cell borders, could not be called acute or "toxic" in character. At present we make only limited deductions from our observations. In the <b>bacterial</b> <b>dissociation</b> phenomenon we have at least a new line of investigation, and different variants of tubercle bacilli must be taken into consideration when planning new tuberculosis studies. With the stabilization of the human type variants, experiments such as reported here may bring about the proper clinical interpretation, of the course of human tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative {{zoonotic}} {{pathogenic bacterium}} causing gastroenteritis in human and animals. It shares a conserved virulence plasmid encoding for a needle-like secretion machinery, or type III secretion system, {{which can be}} found in other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. The type III secretion system (T 3 SS) is a macromolecular assembly that enables pathogenic effector proteins (or Yersinia outer proteins, Yops) to be transported into eukaryotic host cells. This export machinery is assembled in a highly ordered stepwise mechanism. The activation of T 3 SS is also dependent on calcium concentration, temperature, and pH of the growth media as mimic factors for host cell’s contact. The T 3 SS-associated inner-membrane protein, YscU, of Yersinia is proposed to function as a substrate specificity switch protein and forms basal structure of T 3 SS. YscU has four α helical transmembrane domain and a soluble cytoplasmic domain YscUC which undergoes auto-proteolysis at a conserved N↑PTH motif. The auto-proteolysis process, which is required for the assembly of the injectisome and secretion of Yops, results in a 10 -kDa C-terminal polypeptide fragment, denoted YscUCC and 6 -kDa N-terminal fragment YscUCN. In this thesis, we showed that YscUC dissociation was important for Yops secretion and resulted in unfolded YscUCN and oligomeric YscUCC. By combination in vivo and in vitro methods, growth media conditions as calcium, temperature, and pH were indicated to control secretion by regulation of YscUC dissociation. The calcium-binding isotherm to YscUC was fit best with a one-site binding model resulting in Kd 800 µM, which is identical to calcium level that blocks secretion in vivo. YscU is also the key protein for the T 3 SS pH dependence, demonstrated by thermal unfolding profile and secondary structure of protein were altered between pH 7. 4 and 6. 0. In addition, bacterial inner membrane was proposed to assist the YscUCN folding, monitored by using lipid bilayer as a mimic environment in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. This binding is important for Yops secretion and YscUC is anchored to <b>bacterial</b> membrane upon <b>dissociation.</b> The other substrate specificity switch protein YscP has function as a “molecular ruler” controlling length of the secretion needle. Previous genetic experiments have suggested that YscP and YscU interact physically, when mutation at defined residues on yscU (suppressor mutants) rescued Yops secretion in null-yscP mutant. In this research, direct binding of YscU and YscP was proved as weak but important interaction with Kd 430 mM by application of NMR and the binding interface of YscP was centred on the last helix of YscUC. Furthermore, we found that the YscP interaction could inhibit YscU auto-proteolysis. Studying the dissociation kinetic of suppressor YscUC variants at temperature 30 and 37 oC provides strong support to a model where YscU is a temperature sensor for T 3 SS and YscUC dissociation is required for Yops secretion. Interestingly, the NPTH motif is conserved through most of YscU family members, meaning that role of dissociation may be conserved also in other bacterial injectisomes. To this end, the dissociation of YscU {{can be used as a}} therapeutic target in drug discovery. We attempted to identify the small-molecules that can hinder YscU dissociation. The small compound methyl(5 -methyl- 2 -phenyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidin- 4 -yl) acetate was found to be able to inhibit dissociation and to crystalize full YscUC, which has never been successfully done before. Finally, we found that the inner-rod protein YscI is binding to YscUC with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry as shown with pull-down assays and isothermal titration calorimetry. Taken together we have made several discoveries that expand the functional palette of YscU and all these functions were shown to have biological relevance with Yops secretion levels. In light of the strong sequence conservation between T 3 SS utilizing pathogenic bacteria the findings are likely to be general characters...|$|R
