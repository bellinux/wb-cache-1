5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed <b>by</b> <b>war</b> and experience, helped shape the mission of the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command.|$|E

The TUC, suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald, was cool towards {{her and she was}} not re-elected to the General Council. She remained Labour's candidate at Wallsend; in the general election of 1935 she was again defeated. She never {{returned to}} parliament; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading, but when it became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely <b>by</b> <b>war,</b> she resigned her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|Another embassy from Daqin is {{recorded}} as bringing tributary {{gifts to the}} Chinese Jin Empire (265–420 AD). This occurred in 284 AD {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Jin (r. 266–290 AD), and was recorded in the Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao. This embassy was presumably sent by the Emperor Carus (r. 282–283 AD), whose brief reign was preoccupied <b>by</b> <b>war</b> with Sasanian Persia.|$|E

Despite Zeron's defeat, Elena is still cursed, and decides to end Experiment Zero. Aeron chooses to join her, and the two throw themselves into the Scar, using the chain to close it as they fall. The epilogue reveals that the land continued to be plagued <b>by</b> <b>war,</b> and that the Vestra passed down Aeron and Elena's tale as a legend.|$|E
5|$|Galka: A hulking race of {{powerful}} warriors, the Galka's capital city was destroyed <b>by</b> <b>war</b> 600 years ago.

They possess the highest HP and vitality in the game, but also the lowest MP. The Galka are cursed with rage.|$|E
5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} <b>by</b> <b>war,</b> diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, a {{group was}} created whose {{objective}} was to channel the Senne into subterranean tunnels for nearly its entire course through the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, {{the course of the}} river was to be changed from the central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed <b>by</b> <b>war</b> and the work being done on the North–South connection, was only finished in 1955.|$|E

5|$|After gaining {{first-class}} honours at The Queen's College, Oxford, Cruttwell {{was elected}} a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1911, {{and the following}} year became a lecturer in history at Hertford College. His academic career was interrupted <b>by</b> <b>war</b> service during which he suffered severe wounds; after his return to Oxford in 1919 he became dean of Hertford, and in 1930, principal of the college. It was during his tenure as dean that the feud with Waugh developed while the latter was a history scholar at Hertford, in 1922–24. This hostility was pursued on Waugh's part until shortly before Cruttwell's death.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily {{populated}} by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya {{and was an}} important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated <b>by</b> <b>war,</b> disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At {{the same time the}} Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Fitzroy on 12 May 1942 {{and was a member}} of the 30 Squadron. He served as an {{airframe}} fitter during World War II, which severely interrupted his sporting career, and first-class cricket was cancelled after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific. He was discharged on 25 January 1946 with the rank of aircraftman. According to cricket administrator Bill Jacobs, the war cost Harvey his prime cricketing years. Jacobs believed that Harvey would have been selected for Australia in the period otherwise interrupted <b>by</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1885, British {{claims to}} a West African sphere of {{influence}} received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company {{under the leadership of}} Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came {{under the control of the}} British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. <b>By</b> <b>war,</b> the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.|$|E
5|$|Itachi is {{a member}} of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, {{establishing}} milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to live up to. His early childhood was marred <b>by</b> <b>war,</b> the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this {{would lead to a}} dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused <b>by</b> <b>war</b> and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E

5|$|Mohamed was the {{youngest}} person to represent Somalia at the London Games {{at the age of}} 18. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. In an interview with The Guardian before the Games, Mohamed said he wanted people to see a Somali athlete competing at the Olympics and wanted to influlence the international community's view of his country away from being a nation afflicted <b>by</b> <b>war</b> and without any development. He wanted to win a medal because of his long training routine. Mohamed was drawn in the men's 1500 metres second heat on 3 August, finishing 13th out of 14 athletes, with a time of three minutes and 46.16 seconds. He finished ahead of Yemen's Nabil Al-Garbi (three minutes and 55.46 seconds) but behind Jamale Aarrass of France (three minutes and 45.13 seconds) in a heat led by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Shaween (three minutes and 39.42 seconds). Overall Mohamed placed 38th out of 43 participants, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing 6.21 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who made the later stages.|$|E
5|$|Much of this wealth {{was spent}} by Henry on {{maintaining}} his court and household, including {{many of the}} building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland hung just 200. Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 handguns. Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government {{out of their own}} income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like tonnage and poundage, granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around £100,000), but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about <b>by</b> <b>war.</b> Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.|$|E
