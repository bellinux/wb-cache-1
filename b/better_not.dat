Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E

After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be <b>better</b> <b>not</b> to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be <b>better</b> <b>not</b> to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E

25|$|Zeffirelli filmed his Romeo and Juliet {{shortly after}} {{completing}} {{work on his}} 1967 film The Taming of the Shrew, and had learned from his experience on that project that it was <b>better</b> <b>not</b> to include speeches made redundant by his vivid images. He played around 35% of Shakespeare's script, enhancing {{the focus on the}} two central characters and making them more sympathetic, while simplifying their roles to make them less tricky for his young leads to play. He tellingly juxtaposes the betrothal of Juliet and Paris with the Capulets' crumbling marriage. Yet the film is often noted for its zest for life and for love: the former epitomised by John McEnery's Mercutio, the latter by Leonard Whiting's Romeo. In contrast to Renato Castellani's 1954 version, Zeffirelli highlighted Romeo's positive relationships with the Friar, Balthazar and Mercutio. The way in which Mercutio physically collapses onto Romeo after the Queen Mab speech, and again when mortally wounded, has been credited with introducing homosexual overtones into the public perception of their relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgment}} {{came just}} before full council elections were due in Lambeth, which had elections for every seat once every four years. If the councillors appealed and lost, {{they would be}} disqualified {{in the middle of}} the term, endangering Labour control of the council. The Lambeth Labour group decided (with seven dissenting) that it was <b>better</b> <b>not</b> to appeal, accept the disqualifications and select replacement candidates for the impending elections. After holding a special meeting to transfer running of the council up to the election to a special committee consisting of three Labour councillors who had not been surcharged (Janet Boston, and two had been elected in byelections after the rate was set), the councillors were disqualified on 30 March. The Transport and General Workers' Union ended financial support for the Liverpool and Lambeth councillors at the beginning of April, having spent £107,000 up to then. At the end of July 1986, the surcharged Lambeth councillors were given 21 months to pay off the surcharges; they were to pay £5,000 per month between them.|$|E
25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian {{told me that he had}} seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is <b>better</b> <b>not</b> to speak of them.|$|E

25|$|During {{this same}} period, Stone {{directed}} {{one of his}} most ambitious, controversial and successful films to date: JFK, that depicts the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. In 1991, Stone showed JFK to Congress on Capitol Hill, which helped lead to passage of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992. The Assassination Records Review Board (created by Congress to lessen, but not end the secrecy surrounding Kennedy's assassination) discussed the film, including Stone's observation {{at the end of the}} film, about the dangers inherent in government secrecy. Stone published an annotated version of the screenplay, in which he cites references for his claims, shortly after the film's release.I make my films like you're going to die if you miss the next minute.

Originally based on a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, critics recognized its portrayal of violence and the intended satire on the media. Before it was released, the MPAA gave the film a NC-17 rating; this caused Stone to cut four minutes of film footage in order to obtain an R rating (he eventually released the unrated version on VHS and DVD in 2001).|$|E
