5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, <b>bays,</b> <b>and</b> in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, {{followed}} by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds). Most species are generalist feeders, {{but a few}} are specialists. They typically hunt non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, <b>bays</b> <b>and</b> rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E

5|$|Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia {{has led to}} a {{dramatic}} improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected <b>bays</b> <b>and</b> estuaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} (Triakis semifasciata) is {{a species of}} houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatlán in Mexico. Typically {{measuring}} 1.2–1.5 m (3.9–4.9ft) long, this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in <b>bays</b> <b>and</b> estuaries, swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs.
