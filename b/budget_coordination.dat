40|$|Several of the {{transition}} economies are devolving fiscal authority to subnational governments {{at a time when}} it is also important to consolidate fiscal policy. This can be problematic because, without appropriate care, the central government''s ability to determine the level and structure of revenues, public spending, and borrowing may well diminish as fiscal policy is devolved. This paper focuses on how the center can maintain its ability to conduct fiscal policy while devolving revenue, spending, and borrowing powers to lower levels of government. Empirical evidence shows that countries with good governance have maintained fiscal control despite a high degree of fiscal devolution. And decentralization is associated with better fiscal outcomes for middle-income countries with strong governance. Fiscal management issues are explored in four key areas: <b>budget</b> <b>coordination</b> mechanisms at the macro level tax-effort incentives and revenue-sharing mechanisms expenditure control and hard-budget constraints and criteria and rules for borrowing. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} I present {{a survey of}} the {{economic}} literature which is concerned with federal public finance. I argue {{that it is difficult to}} derive policy-relevant normative propositions about federal financial relations, but that it is possible to suggest means by which one could improve the efficiency of policy decisions. There is a review of the discussion of the Buchanan and Scott contributions of the 1950 s and 1960 s, and it is concluded that it is easier to discover significant questions than agreed answers. Practical considerations of geography, regional economy, and administrative separation of powers are then introduced. The argument is that the normative economic definition of equity and efficiency may have little relevance to the practical policy-question of forming and maintaining a federation. I conclude with a proposal for linking the attempt to solve questions of regional and national policy through a network of committees [...] one for each of the following areas: <b>budget</b> <b>coordination,</b> regional equalization, common standards, stabilization, and economic growth. ...|$|E

The reason is that international coordination enables the domestic and foreign governments to form a coalition that excludes future policy-makers.

The analytical literature on capital budgeting (see Antle and Eppen 1985; Antle and Fellingham 1990; Fellingham and Young 1990; Arya et al. 1994, 1996, 2000; Antle and Fellingham 1995; Baiman et al. 2013) considers situations in which one or more managers have access to investment projects. The manager(s) learn(s) the investment projects’ (expected) profitability. The superior has access to financial resources and has to decide whether and under which conditions to finance the investment project(s). This literature stresses the adverse selection problem inherent in the budgeting process. In these models, communication of the managers is optimal for the company, i.e., the participative budgeting process is always preferred. The present study shows that the use of the top-down budgeting process is optimal for a low importance of coordinating the company’s divisions. For a high importance of <b>coordination,</b> a participative <b>budgeting</b> process yields a higher expected profit. With a participative <b>budgeting</b> process, perfect <b>coordination</b> is achieved. The associated benefits exceed the additional incentive costs of inducing truthful reports from the managers when the importance of coordination is high.|$|R
