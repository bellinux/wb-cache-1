40|$|The rising {{complexity}} of electronic systems, {{the reduction of}} components size, and the increment of working frequencies demand every time more accurate and stable integrated circuits, which require more precise simulation programs during the design process. PSPICE, widely used to simulate the general behavior of integrated circuits, does not consider many of the physical effects {{that can be found}} in real devices. Compact models, HICUM and MEXTRAM, have been developed over recent decades, in order to eliminate this deficiency. This paper presents some of the physical aspects that have not been studied so far, such as the expression of base-emitter voltage, including the emitter emission coefficient effect (n), physical explanation and simulation procedure, as well as a new extraction method for the diffusion potential VDE(T), based on the forward biased <b>base-emitter</b> <b>capacitance,</b> showing excellent agreement between experimental and theoretical results...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{reports on}} three speed {{optimized}} pnp bipolar phototransistors build {{in a standard}} 180 nm CMOS process using a special starting wafer. The starting wafer consists of a low doped p epitaxial layer {{on top of the}} p substrate. This low doped p epitaxial layer leads to a thick space-charge region between base and collector and thus to a high − 3 dB bandwidth at low collector–emitter voltages. For a further increase of the bandwidth the presented phototransistors were designed with small emitter areas resulting in a small <b>base-emitter</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The three presented phototransistors were implemented in sizes of 40 × 40 μm 2 and 100 × 100 μm 2. Optical DC and AC measurements at 410 nm, 675 nm and 850 nm were done for phototransistor characterization. Due to the speed optimized design and the layer structure of the phototransistors, bandwidths up to 76. 9 MHz and dynamic responsivities up to 2. 89 A/W were achieved. Furthermore simulations of the electric field strength and space-charge regions were done...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} parameter-extraction method of a high-frequency small-signal SiGe heterojunction bipolar tran-sistor model is proposed in this paper. It was found that, without taking the intrinsic circuit elements into account, the conductance of the substrate network will be underestimated, while the suscep-tance of the substrate network will be overestimated. Therefore, a new extraction technique of the substrate-network parameters was developed, which {{has taken the}} intrinsic circuit elements into consideration. Transforming the intrinsic equivalent circuit into its common-collector configuration, all the intrinsic circuit elements are extracted directly from the measured S-parameters without any numerical optimization. Two formulas {{used to determine the}} intrinsic base resistance are presented, which is followed by an accuracy-improvement procedure to achieve a better accuracy of the extraction results. Simplified formulas to determine the base–emitter resistance, <b>base–emitter</b> <b>capacitance,</b> transconduc-tance, and excess phase delay are also presented. The proposed method is validated with SiGe HBTs fabricated with a 0. 35 -µm BiCMOS technology from 1 to 30 GHz. The agreements between the measured and modeled data are excellent in the desired fre-quency range over a wide range of bias points.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{which may}} be used to analyze the noise characteristics of HBT oscillators is presented. A large signal model of a HBT is developed based largely on the Gummel-Poon transistor model. A new <b>base-emitter</b> diffusion <b>capacitance</b> model is also generated which shows improved accuracy over conventional bipolar transistor models in characterizing HBTs. The large signal characteristics of the oscillator are then established using a time domain simulator. Conversion matrix theory is applied to the large signal model to generate an equivalent linear oscillator model which accounts for all of the frequency conversion effects which occur due to circuit nonlinearities. A bias dependent noise model of the HBT is also developed. It is found that the dominant sources of noise within the device are due to thermal, shot, and flicker noise. The modulation of the shot and flicker noise sources are also analyzed. The amount of frequency conversion which occurs as a result from the modulation of these noise sources is established. The modulated noise sources within the HBT are then inserted into the linear oscillator model to establish the overall noise characteristics of the HBT oscillator. Experimental results are also presented which support the validity of the analysis procedure;It Is found that the effects which result from the modulation of shot and flicker noise sources within oscillators are very significant. The upconversion of noise due to the modulation of flicker noise sources is found to be as significant as the upconversion which results from circuit nonlinearities. Thus, the upconversion of flicker noise cannot be associated with any one nonlinear mechanism. Rather it is a result of a complex interaction between the circuit nonlinearities and noise modulation mechanisms;The noise within many other periodically driven nonlinear networks may also be characterized using the analysis procedure presented in this paper. Examples of such networks include mixers, limiters, and frequency multipliers...|$|R
