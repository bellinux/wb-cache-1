30|$|Through the {{examination}} of both R and grain-size distributions (Fig.  12), distinctive differences between <b>beach</b> and slope <b>deposits</b> are revealed. In order to compare {{the characteristics of the}} different deposits, a plot of the mean values and ranges between the first and third quartiles is shown for all samples in Fig.  12. This diagram shows clearly that the areas in which the <b>beach</b> <b>deposits</b> and slope deposits plot are completely separate. The <b>beach</b> <b>deposits</b> had high R values and ranged from coarse-grained sands to granules. In contrast, the slope deposits had low R values and ranged in size from granules to pebbles. These distinct variations imply that there is a significant difference in cumulative energy between the two <b>deposit</b> types. The <b>beach</b> <b>deposits</b> comprise particles that are highly abraded by wave action and beach drift transport, whereas the slope deposits were comparatively unaffected by such physical abrasion. Therefore, the new roundness parameter R can be considered helpful for the study of sedimentary processes and the estimation of particle origins.|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{mapping of}} geomorphological, {{biological}} and archaeological sea-level markers around the Capo Schiso volcanic headland, {{a few kilometers}} south of Taormina, north-eastern Sicily, has documented the occurrence of three Holocene paleo-shorelines raised at different altitudes. The uppermost shoreline (PS 1) is represented by a fossiliferous <b>beach</b> <b>deposit</b> that is heavily eroded and only few small sections, at elevations ranging between similar to 3 and similar to 5 m above the present sea-level, are visible. The middle shoreline (PS 2) was found at a maximum altitude of similar to 3 m and is represented by algal rims, remnants of barnacle bands and vermetid concretions, and by a fossiliferous <b>beach</b> <b>deposit.</b> The lowermost shoreline (PS 3) includes remnants of algal rims, vermetid concretions, fossil barnacle bands and a beachrock, and reaches an elevation of 1. 60 - 1. 80 m. New radiocarbon dating results, integrated with published ages from nearby paleo-shoreline outcrops, constrains for the Taormina region an average uplift rate of 1. 7 - 1. 8 mm/yr in the last 5 ka, and the occurrence of three co-seismic uplift events at 4. 4 - 3. 9 ka, 2. 1 - 1. 8 ka and <= 1. 0 ka ago. Abrupt displacements are tentatively attributed to footwall uplift along an offshore normal fault, but further investigations are needed to better constrain the causative source of past earthquakes. Notwith-standing, based on coastal tectonic analysis, this paper provides a new assessment of age and recurrence time of Holocene earthquakes in a historically strong seismogenic area.

Their petrography, trace element geochemistry and the Rb/Sr whole rock age of 55 ± 5 Ma confirm that they are derived from the Lundy granite which is about 49 km to the southwest of Gower. Amino acid analyses of fossil gastropods in the Patella beach have provided an age of 210000 years. Various hypotheses of transportation of pebbles from Lundy and Pembrokeshire to Butterslade are considered.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study involving 52 microtidal beaches spanning from reflective to dissipative states and located in tropical, subtropical and temperate {{regions in the}} Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans was carried out to unravel the relative roles of latitude and beach morphodynamics in determining beach macrobenthic species richness, abundance, biomass and mean individual body sizes. Since beach slope {{is one of the}} most important factors controlling beach fauna, a model based on beach geometry was applied to the sub-aerial <b>beach</b> <b>deposit</b> to understand the role of physical factors in predicting equilibrium beach slopes. Additionally, it was tested if the occurrence of beach types is related to latitude, and how physical factors change with morphodynamics and latitude. The beach morphometric model makes three assumptions: 1) that the cross-section of a <b>beach</b> <b>deposit</b> is equivalent to a right-angled triangle, 2) that the physical hydrodynamic factors (wave height and spring tide amplitude) and the <b>beach</b> <b>deposit</b> characteristics (sand grain size, beach slope and width) are interchangeable with their geometric counterparts producing an equation to explain beach geometry, and 3) that the predicted beach slope is in equilibrium with the hydrodynamic and sedimentological forces. The equation for predicting beach slope was derived and then tested against field data collected over 52 beaches. The predicted slopes were not significantly different from the observed slopes of the studied natural beaches. However some estimated slopes were different than observed ones. Possible sources of deviation between calculated and observed slopes may be the systematic sampling errors associated with field data. Alternatively, observed slopes could be the result of past hydrodynamic conditions, explaining the differences with the slopes calculated by the beach morphometric model, which assumes a state of equilibrium between beach slope and hydrodynamic conditions. A higher correlation of beach faunal structure with observed slopes rather than with present hydrodynamic conditions could then be indicative of faunal responses to previous hydrodynamic conditions in the same way was the observed slopes. The beach morphometric model could therefore be also useful in predicting faunal responses to changing hydrodynamic conditions. Since the model does not consider wave period, it is concluded that further tests should be done using laboratory and time-series field data and incorporating the role of wave period and beach permeability to ascertain its predictive value. Tropical regions had significantly more beaches in a reflective state than temperate and subtropical regions. Some tropical beaches were fronted by coral reefs, which not only provided coarse carbonate particles, but also additionally dissipated the low wave energy present in these climatic areas. Only one dissipative beach with high energy was found in the tropics, in southeast Madagascar. Temperate and subtropical regions, on the other hand, were dominated by dissipative beaches with medium to fine sands. Open oceanic reflective beaches were non-existent in the subtropics and rare in temperate regions, only occurring in estuaries, enclosed bays or on islands facing the continent. Intermediate beaches were more common in the subtropics but also occurred frequently in the other two regions, having higher energy in temperate regions. Reflective beaches had significantly steeper slopes, coarser sands, smaller waves and shorter swash lengths when compared to dissipative beaches. Additionally, reflective beaches were narrower, had deeper water tables and in consequence shorter saturation zones. Wave periods and surfzone widths were on average larger on dissipative than on reflective beaches. The frequency of occurrence of beach types is therefore related to the climatic signature of each latitude. Mid latitudes would be predicted to have more dissipative beaches with large and long waves because of their proximity to the storm generating belt around 50 - 60 ° S - these beaches will have a predominantly finer sands because of the input by rivers in rainy areas. Lower latitudes will have more reflective beaches due to a modal low energy wave climate and also because of the presence of inshore and offshore biotic structures such as coral reefs that dissipate even more the energy from the waves. Tropical and subtropical regions had larger marine species pools than temperate regions. After controlling for biogeographical differences in total species pool, dissipative beaches were on average significantly richer than intermediate and reflective beaches. Crustaceans were also more diverse on dissipative beaches, this difference being not significant for either molluscs or polychaetes. Significant relationships were found between total beach species richness (with or without terrestrial species), crustacean and mollusc species richness with beach morphodynamics as represented by the Dean’s index. Indices incorporating the role of tide, such as BSI, were less important in predicting species richness on the microtidal beaches studied here. Several other physical factors were also significantly correlated with species richness, the most important being the <b>Beach</b> <b>Deposit</b> Index, i. e. BDI, a composite index of beach slope and grain size. The highest correlation was between BDI and relative species richness, i. e. local beach species richness / regional species richness. Total regional marine species richness was higher in Madagascar and North Brazil (tropical beaches) than in Southeast Brazil (subtropical), or the West Coast of South Africa and South-Central Chile (temperate beaches). Not only was the pool of species capable of colonizing beaches richer in tropical and subtropical regions, but also local diversity of each morphodynamic beach type was higher among tropical beaches than their temperate counterparts. Although the results of this study agree with the predictions of the swash exclusion hypotheses, several reflective and intermediate beaches had higher species richness than predicted before and this seems to be linked to the presence of finer sediments and a less turbulent flow for larvae to settle. It is concluded that beach species richness is not necessarily controlled by one major morphodynamic parameter; this control is complex and probably involves multiple interacting biotic (biological interactions) and abiotic (e. g. grain size, wave height, beach slope and width, water table) factors. Species richness seems to be controlled on two different scales: on an evolutionary one where tropical and subtropical regions have higher regional and local diversity due to higher speciation rates; and on an ecological scale, where fine grained sand beaches have their carrying capacity enhanced by higher larval settlement rates and survival of recruits towards adulthood. On average dissipative beaches had higher total densities and macrofaunal abundances than reflective ones. Crustaceans, terrestrial species and cirolanid isopods such as Excirolana spp. were also more abundant on dissipative beaches. The difference was not significant for molluscs and polychaetes. Significant relationships were found between total abundance, crustacean species richness and beach morphodynamics as represented by the Dean’s index. Again, BSI was less important than individual physical factors in determining faunal abundance on the studied microtidal beaches. Several other physical factors were also significantly correlated with abundance, the most important being the <b>Beach</b> <b>Deposit</b> Index (BDI). The highest correlation was between BDI and total macrofaunal abundance. Factors related to surf zone processes, and possibly productivity, were highly correlated with total community, crustaceans, Excirolana spp. and terrestrial species abundances. The abundances of polychaetes and molluscs were better correlated with factors related to the <b>beach</b> <b>deposit</b> (BDI, slope, grain size and water table depth). Significant differences were observed between latitudinal regions for the average beach and also for each beach type. In general temperate beaches harboured larger community densities and abundances, and also crustacean, Excirolana spp. and terrestrial abundances. Mollusc and polychaete abundances were larger on subtropical and tropical beaches. The control of abundance on a sandy beach is complex and involves multifactorial processes at evolutionary and ecological scales. At evolutionary scales animals seem to attain higher abundances in the region where they first evolved, e. g. amphipods and isopods in temperate regions. At ecological scales they attain higher abundances where productivity is higher (total macrofaunal, crustaceans, Excirolana spp., terrestrial spp.) or where the settlement environment is more benign (molluscs and polychaetes). Dissipative beaches supported larger average and total community biomass than reflective beaches. Crustaceans, terrestrial species and cirolanid isopods such as Excirolana spp. also had larger biomass on dissipative beaches. The difference was not significant for molluscs and polychaetes. Significant relationships were found between the biomass of community and taxonomic groups with beach morphodynamics as represented by the Dean’s morphodynamic index. On the microtidal beaches studied here, BSI was less important than other morphodynamic indices and single physical factors in determining faunal biomass and mean individual body size. Surf zone characteristics such as wave height, period and surf zone width had the highest correlations with community, crustacean...|$|E

Six of the reported taxa are considered dubious records (5 Gastropoda, 1 Bivalvia). The stratigraphic sequence of Praia Formosa is composed of two main units, about 2 - 4 meters above present-day sea level. In the lower unit, Patella ulyssiponensis dominates the fossil assemblage of the basal calcareous conglomerate while Myoforceps arustatus (Dillwyn, 1817) dominates the assemblage associated to a calcareous algae mat. Above a non-depositional hiatus surface, a sandy <b>beach</b> <b>deposit</b> mainly composes the upper unit. Its fossil assemblages are dominated by large amounts of Eruilin castanea (Montagu, 1803) and, in a less extent, Lucinella diwricntn (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ensis minor (Chenu, 1843).

It {{has been shown that}} the rocks of Zemlepakhtinskaya Formation are facially variable. The shallow littoral facies are confined to the western and central parts of Sredny Peninsula, the deeper sublitt oral facies are confined to the eastern part of Sredny Peninsula and to Motka Cape of Rybachy Peninsula. It has b een established that lenses and beds with titanium-zirconium placer mineralization occur solely in littoral facies. The ore minerals in aleurite-psamite of Zemlepakhtinskaya Formation are represented by leucoxene, rutile and zircon, and in contemporary <b>beach</b> <b>deposits</b> – by ilmenite, rutile and minor zircon. Paleogeograp hic reconstruction indicates that almost all deposits of Neoproterozoic (Upper Riphean) Kildin Group were accumulated in shallow (littoral and sublittoral) environment during dominant humid climate and intense weat hering of source area. Thus, not only deposits of Zemlepakhtinskaya Formation, but also the whole succession of Kildin Group can be regarded perspective for placers' accumulation. The low grade of heavy minerals (mainly Ti an d Zr minerals) in contemporary <b>beach</b> <b>deposits</b> from Sredny Peninsula and Motka Cape from Rybachy Peninsu la is related to weak weathering of the Baltic Shield during Quaternary and to accumulation of coarse debris in littoral zone, preventing the differentiation of sand by wave action...|$|R
