The continental divide of South America separates these rivers. The rivers fed by the Arroyo Turbio do not reach the Atlantic.

In bivariate and multivariate analyses, reproducibility was strongly related to stability of diet; those whose diets changed least over the 15 -year period had greatest diet reproducibility. Greater total diet reproducibility was also found among men with higher education, among women of < 110 % desirable weight reporting no special diet and among women reporting no medications. Consistent with current models of memory, the retrospective report of diet was strongly related to the current report of diet. Agreement between the retrospective and <b>baseline</b> diet <b>reports</b> was greater than agreement between the current and <b>baseline</b> diet <b>reports.</b> This indicates that, as a proxy for past diet, the retrospective report of diet is superior to the current report.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional LinkThe objective of this longitudinal study was to estimate the incidence rate of asthma, and to compare the incidence between subjects with or without <b>baseline</b> <b>reporting</b> of certain respiratory symptoms. A follow-up of the random population samples in the European Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Estonia was conducted in 1999 - 2001, in a population aged 30 - 54 yrs at follow-up (n= 14, 731). Asthma was defined as reporting either asthma or physician-diagnosed asthma, and a reported year when asthma symptoms were first noticed. Incidence rates, incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals. The incidence rate of asthma was 2. 2 cases per 1, 000 person-yrs. The incidence was higher among females (2. 9 cases. 1, 000 person-yrs(- 1)) than among males (1. 5 cases. 1, 000 person-yrs(- 1)). When subjects with <b>baseline</b> <b>reporting</b> of wheezing were excluded, the incidence rate decreased to 1. 7 cases. 1, 000 person-yrs(- 1), with a further decrease to 1. 5 cases. 1, 000 person-yrs(- 1) after exclusion of subjects with wheezing, nocturnal dyspnoea, chest tightness and cough. There was a strong association between onset of asthma and wheezing at baseline. In this prospective, population-based study, the incidence rate of asthma in the whole population sample ranged 1. 5 - 2. 2. 1, 000 person-yrs(- 1), with a higher incidence range among females. The incidence was dependent {{on the extent to}} which subjects with respiratory symptoms were excluded from follow-up.

As such, this study was developed to assist the identification of the various critical issues affecting the water sector. This study was agreed upon by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Namibia with the help of funding from DANCED. The study is the follow up of an environmental <b>baseline</b> <b>report</b> on the Erongo region in Namibia. The <b>baseline</b> <b>report</b> was commisioned to gather data on the region which would assist the creation of an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan. This <b>baseline</b> <b>report</b> was undertaken by the whole MPhil class as a group exercise. Individual dissertations were then carried out by the members of the Mphil class. The students had to choose topics that were relevant to the study area. This study is one of these dissertations. The study was guided by the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management and the need to be of use in the planning process for water resource utilisation in the study area. To achieve this, the Integrated Environment Management theory is used together with the principles of Integrated Water Resource Management. This will ensure that the study * Uses a broad definition of the environment so as to identify all key opportunities and constraints of the water sector. * Would help towards the creation of a plan to manage the water sector in order to optimise the benefits of the sector while at the same time minimising or mitigating the financial, environmental and social costs. The study aims to identify the critical environmental impacts of the water sector in the study area. These impacts are then assessed but not evaluated...|$|E

Casino style gambling has been expanding rapidly {{over the last decade}} in Canada. Gambling is often associated with a range of positive and negative outcomes for individuals, local communities and society and is therefore an important public policy topic. The BC Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Gaming Policy and Enforcement Branch requires research on the economic and social costs and benefits of increasing casino style venues to develop responsible gaming policies and assist the provincial government and other stakeholders in community planning. The opening of four gaming venues in the Lower Mainland (two new facilities and two expansions of existing facilities to include slot machines) created an opportunity to study the impacts of new gaming facilities.

Results: PD patients reported more NMS than did the ET patients (p 50. 002). When compared to their <b>baseline</b> <b>report,</b> at follow-up, PD patients reported less nocturia (p 50. 02), sadness (p 50. 01), insomnia (p 50. 02), and restless legs (p 50. 04) and more nausea (p 50. 024), unexplained pain (p 50. 03), weight change (p 50. 009), and daytime sleepiness (p 50. 03). When compared to their <b>baseline</b> <b>report,</b> ET patients reported less loss of interest (p 50. 03), anxiety (p 50. 006), and insomnia (p 50. 02).
