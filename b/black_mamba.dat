5|$|The venom of the <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> is {{extremely}} toxic. Its bites can deliver about 100–120mg of venom on average and the maximum dose recorded is 400mg. It is reported that before antivenom was widely available, {{the mortality rate}} from a bite was nearly 100%. The bite of a <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes, or less. Without effective antivenom therapy, death typically occurs in 7–15 hours. Presently, there is a polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> bites from many localities, and a new antivenom is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> is diurnal and chiefly {{an ambush}} predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and rock hyrax, bushbabies, and bats. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> is {{primarily}} terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, especially where {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes and dense forests. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} available concerning the lifespan of wild <b>black</b> <b>mambas,</b> but the longest surviving captive example had a recorded lifespan of 11 years. It {{is possible that}} wild <b>black</b> <b>mambas</b> may live significantly longer than this.|$|R
5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>mambas</b> are {{generally}} solitary, but not strictly so; {{as a rule}} they interact very little except in male rivalry during the mating season. However, <b>black</b> <b>mambas</b> are well known to share retreats occasionally, either with other mambas, or sometimes with other species of snakes.|$|R

5|$|Like most Elapidae, {{the scales}} of the <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> are smooth and flat, without keels. Most {{specimens}} feature 23–25 rows of scales, but rarely as few as 21.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> has a {{wide and}} {{fragmented}} range within sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, {{it has been observed}} in north east Democratic Republic of the Congo, south western Sudan to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, eastern Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, southwards to Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana to KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, and Namibia; then north easterly through Angola to south eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The black mamba's distribution contains gaps within the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria and Mali. These gaps may lead physicians to misidentify <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> bites and administer an inappropriate antivenom.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> is graceful but skittish {{and often}} unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E

5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E

50|$|The Dangerous Creatures exhibit {{includes}} various reptiles, amphibians and arachnids, some {{of which}} are venomous in their newly set-up Dangerous Creatures section, which is apart from the main aquarium. This sub-section contains both local and exotic animals, from rock pythons to Burmese pythons, Nile crocodiles, <b>black</b> <b>mambas,</b> tarantulas, scorpions, and gila monsters.|$|R
5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only by the size it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially immune to venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E
5|$|Peptides in <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> venom {{have been}} found to be {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5000|$|Agonistic {{fighting}} for <b>black</b> <b>mambas</b> involves a wrestling match in which opponents attempt to pin each other’s head repeatedly to the ground. [...] Fights normally last {{a few minutes}} but can extend to over an hour. The purpose of fighting is to secure mating rights to receptive females nearby during the breeding season.|$|R
25|$|Most bites {{occur in}} {{industrial}} plantations, which attract {{many types of}} snake prey. Banana plantations are associated with vipers such as night adders, while rubber and palm tree plantations attract elapids, including cobras and <b>black</b> <b>mambas.</b> Important cobra species include the forest cobra and the black-necked spitting cobra. In forested areas of Guinea, cobras may inflict more than 30% of all venomous bites.|$|R
50|$|One of London Zoo's most {{well-known}} buildings, the Reptile House opened in 1927 and {{was designed by}} Joan Beauchamp Procter and Sir Edward Guy Dawber. It houses several species of reptile, including Jamaican boa, Philippine crocodiles, eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, <b>black</b> <b>mambas,</b> rhinoceros iguanas, king cobras, emerald tree boas and Yemen chameleons. In December 2012, a refurbished amphibian section was opened to the public, displaying amphibians such as African bullfrogs, axolotls, caecillians and various types of poison dart frog.|$|R
5|$|A bite from a <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular {{symptoms that}} may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, {{which may be}} accompanied by a triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the <b>black</b> <b>mamba,</b> plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E

But two straight losses of 2-0 (home) and 3-0 (away) to Zambia left The <b>Black</b> <b>Mambas</b> qualification hopes in tatters. Failure to qualify was confirmed with a third straight defeat in a 1-0 away loss to Libya. They would finish their campaign with a moral restoring 3-0 home drubbing of the Comoros.|$|R
50|$|Mambas and cobras are in {{the same}} family: the Elapidae. Like cobras, a mamba may rear and form a hood as part of its threat display, but the mamba's hood is {{narrower}} and is longer than the broader hood of some species of cobra, such as say, the spectacled cobras of parts of Asia. In their threat display mambas commonly gape; the <b>black</b> <b>mamba's</b> mouth is <b>black</b> within, which renders the threat more conspicuous. Typically also, a rearing mamba tends to lean well forward, instead of standing erect as a cobra does.|$|R
25|$|Mambas, cobras, {{and some}} larger puff adder species may claim territories {{of up to}} , which are used by the snakes for hunting and reproduction. These snakes are large enough to defend their {{territory}} from intruders, including humans. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba,</b> in particular, {{is among the most}} venomous snakes in the world {{and one of the most}} aggressive. It is the longest snake on the continent and is able to move at , making it unusually dangerous. Although black mambas cause only 0.5-1% of snakebites in South Africa, they produce the highest mortality rate and the species is responsible for many snake bite fatalities. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba</b> is the species with the highest mortality rate in every single nation in which it occurs, despite not being responsible for the most numerous number of snakebites. It is also the species which has the highest mortality rate worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Most snakebites {{are caused}} by non-venomous snakes. Of the roughly 3,000 known species of snake found worldwide, only 15% are {{considered}} dangerous to humans. The puff adder {{is responsible for the}} most fatalities overall, although saw-scaled vipers inflict more bites in North African countries, where the puff adder is typically not found. The <b>black</b> <b>mamba,</b> although responsible for far fewer snakebite incidents, is the species which has the highest mortality rate in Africa and in the world.|$|E
