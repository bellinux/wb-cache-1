5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to be the first steel <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> bridge built in the United States, and is considered a prototype of the cable-stayed bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden. Similar bridges include a timber-stayed bridge designed in Germany in 1784, the wrought-iron stayed Albert Bridge in London designed in 1873, and the Chow Chow Bridge in Grays Harbor County. The bridge was listed on the Washington Heritage Register on January 25, 2002.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small <b>Box</b> <b>Girder</b> bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E

25|$|Designing {{a strong}} curved jib {{required}} Fairbairn's advanced theoretical {{understanding of the}} mechanics of a <b>box</b> <b>girder.</b> The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of back plates being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a compressive load. To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character of a <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Because the multi-box {{girder bridge}} has many advantages, such as large torsion rigidity, large {{load-bearing}} capacity, stability, fine appearance, good applicability and convenient construction, {{it is widely}} used in China. But for the defection existing in design and construction, many <b>box</b> <b>girders</b> have serious diseases. Aiming at the diseases of a viaduct bridge, the causes of diseases are analyzed and the enforcement method is proposed in this paper. The study shows that, though the <b>box</b> <b>girders</b> have large torsion rigidity, the diaphragms are designed necessarily to enhance the transversal connection between the <b>box</b> <b>girders,</b> to make them bear the loads together, to reduce their stresses and deformation, and to reduce the stresses of deck too...|$|R

25|$|The Airco DH.9 was a {{single-engine}} British bomber aircraft, {{sharing a}} high level of similarities with the preceding DH.4. The standard flight surfaces were broadly the same, but adopted a highly redesigned fuselage configuration, including the repositioning of the pilot's cockpit to a more rearwards position. Structurally, the fuselage was similar to its predecessor; plywood cladding covered the forward fuselage, which had no internal bracing, while a conventional wire-braced <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> structure was used aft of the cockpits. Internal stowage for a pair of 230 lb or four 112 lb bombs was provided for, although there was little use of this capability operationally.|$|E
25|$|Built in {{the late}} 1950s, the Cypress Street Viaduct, a stretch of Interstate 880, was a {{double-deck}} freeway section made of nonductile reinforced concrete that was constructed above and astride Cypress Street in Oakland. Roughly half of the land the Cypress Viaduct was built on was filled marshland, and half was somewhat more stable alluvium. Because of new highway structure design guidelines—the requirement of ductile construction elements—instituted following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, a limited degree of earthquake reinforcement was retrofitted to the Cypress Viaduct in 1977. The added elements were longitudinal restraints at transverse expansion joints in the <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> spans, but no studies were made of possible failure modes specific to the Cypress Viaduct. When the earthquake hit, the shaking was amplified on the former marshland, and soil liquefaction occurred.|$|E
25|$|MD 279 {{was entirely}} reconstructed {{starting}} in the late 1950s. The highway's concrete arch bridge across Little Elk Creek was replaced with a prestressed concrete <b>box</b> <b>girder</b> bridge in 1958 and 1959. MD 279's present course between Little Elk Creek and Belle Hill Road was constructed and in 1959 and 1960 and surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1962. The old portion of MD 279 was replaced with a southern extension of MD 316 on Appleton Road and by MD 823 on Belle Hill Road. The highway from Belle Hill Road to the Delaware state line was reconstructed concurrent {{with the construction of}} I-95 in 1962 and 1963. Newark Avenue between MD 280 (now MD 213) and North Street was brought into the state highway system through a June 29, 1964, road transfer agreement with the county. Finally, Newark Avenue was reconstructed and the portion of MD 279 between US 40 and MD 280 was constructed between 1966 and 1968. The bypassed portion of MD 279 along North Avenue became MD 268. MD 279 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 316 to the Delaware state line between 1981 and 1983. The highway's junction with I-95 was originally constructed as a diamond interchange. The junction was expanded to a cloverleaf interchange between 1984 and 1993.|$|E
