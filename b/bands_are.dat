5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band generation was developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.

5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored <b>bands</b> <b>are</b> caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E

5|$|Jing ping <b>bands</b> <b>are</b> {{made up of}} a boumboum (boom pipe), syak or gwaj (scraper-rattle), tambal or tanbou (tambourine) and accordion. The {{double bass}} and banjo are also {{sometimes}} used. Bamboo flutes led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s, when accordions were introduced. The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result, despite their additional use in serenades, until being revived after the National Independence Competitions.|$|E
5|$|Konishi {{describes}} a wideband 12GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs {{and also has}} a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response). As {{is often the case}} with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which <b>bands</b> <b>are</b> desired and which are considered to be spurious.|$|E

5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal <b>bands</b> <b>are</b> the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E

5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The <b>bands</b> <b>are</b> separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|Other Italian {{folk song}} traditions are less common than ballads and lyric songs. Strophic, {{religious}} laude, sometimes in Latin, are still occasionally performed, and epic songs are also known, {{especially those of}} the maggio celebration.

Yodeling exists in northern Italy, though it is most commonly associated with the folk musics of other Alpine nations. The Italian Carnival is associated with several song types, especially the Carnival of Bagolino, Brescia.
