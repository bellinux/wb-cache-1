25|$|If {{the last}} plague indeed {{selectively}} tended {{to affect the}} firstborn, it {{could be due to}} food polluted during the time of darkness, either by locusts or by the <b>black</b> <b>mold</b> Cladosporium. When people emerged after the darkness, the firstborn would be given priority, as was usual, and would consequently be more likely to be affected by any toxin or disease carried by the food. Meanwhile, the Israelites ate food prepared and eaten very quickly which would have made it less likely to be contaminated. However, this does not explain how the firstborn cattle alone also would have perished.|$|E

Injured soldiers stated they were forced to [...] "pull guard duty" [...] to have some level of security. In an attempt to alleviate the toll that Building 18's condition was taking on the wounded soldiers, a staff team headed by a clinical social worker at WRAMC obtained a grant of $30,000 from the Commander's Initiative Account for improvements; however, [...] "a Psychiatry Department functionary held {{up the rest of the}} money because she feared that buying a lot of recreational equipment close to Christmas would trigger an audit."

We saw steam-plows at work, here, for the first time. The traction engine travels about on its own wheels, till it reaches the required spot; then it stands still and {{by means of a}} wire rope pulls the huge plow toward itself two or three hundred yards across the field, between the rows of cane. The thing cuts down into the <b>black</b> <b>mold</b> {{a foot and a half}} deep. The plow looks like a fore-and-aft brace of a Hudson river steamer, inverted. When the negro steersman sits on one end of it, that end tilts down near the ground, while the other sticks up high in air. This great see-saw goes rolling and pitching like a ship at sea, and it is not every circus rider that could stay on it.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{stairway}} outside the house, which {{led up to}} the rear part of the second story. One day Henry was sent on an errand, and he took a tin bucket along. I knew he would have to ascend those stairs, so I went up and locked the door on the inside, and came down into the garden, which had been newly ploughed and was rich in choice firm clods of <b>black</b> <b>mold.</b> I gathered a generous equipment of these, and ambushed him. I waited till he had climbed the stairs and was near the landing and couldn't escape. Then I bombarded him with clods, which he warded off with his tin bucket the best he could, but without much success, for I was a good marksman. The clods smashing against the weather-boarding fetched my mother out to see what was the matter, and I tried to explain that I was amusing Henry. Both of them were after me in a minute, but I knew the way over that high board fence and escaped for that time. After an hour or two, when I ventured back, there was no one around and I thought the incident was closed. But it was not. Henry was ambushing me. With an unusually competent aim for him, he landed a stone on the side of my head which raised a bump there that felt like the Matterhorn. I carried it to my mother straightway for sympathy, but she was not strongly moved. It seemed to be her idea that incidents like this would eventually reform me if I harvested enough of them. So the matter was only educational. I had had a sterner view of it than that, before.|$|E

40|$|<b>Black</b> koji <b>molds</b> {{including}} its albino mutant, the white koji mold, {{have been widely}} used for making the distilled spirit shochu in Northeast Asia because they produce citric acid which prevents undesirable contamination from bacteria. Since Inui reported Aspergillus luchuensis from black koji in Okinawa in 1901, many fungal names associated with <b>black</b> koji <b>molds</b> were reported. However, some species are similar and differentiation between species is difficult. Fungal taxonomists tried to arrange a taxonomic system for <b>black</b> koji <b>molds,</b> but the results were not clear. Recently, multi-locus sequence typing has been successfully used to taxonomy of black Aspergillus. According to Î²-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequences, <b>black</b> koji <b>molds</b> can be subdivided in three species, A. luchuensis, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus tubingensis. Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus kawachii, Aspergillus inuii, Aspergillus nakazawai, and Aspergillus coreanus are synonyms of A. luchuensis, Aspergillus batatae, Aspergillus aureus (or Aspergillus foetidus), Aspergillus miyakoensis, and Aspergillus usamii (including A. usamii mut. shirousamii) are synonyms of A. niger and Aspergillus saitoi and A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis are synonyms of A. tubingensis. A. luchuensis mut. kawachii was suggested particular names for A. kawachii because of their industrial importance. The history and modern taxonomy of <b>black</b> koji <b>molds</b> is further discussed. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

After nothing was done about the <b>black</b> <b>mold</b> for almost two months, a student's mother contacted ABC11's I-Team to investigate the situation.

This {{designation}} was changed to Model 1905 in 1917, and then to M1905 in 1925, when the Army adopted the M designation nomenclature. The M1905 bayonet has 16 inch (40.6 cm) blade, and a 4 inch (10.1 cm) handle. The bayonet also fits the U.S. M1 Garand rifle. In 1943, a shorter 10 inch (25.4 cm) bladed version was produced with a <b>black</b> <b>molded</b> plastic handle, and designated the M1 bayonet.|$|R

The M1905 and M1942 bayonets are interchangeable and can be used on both the M1903 Springfield and M1 Garand rifles. The designation M1942 was never officially adopted by the Army; all sixteen inch blade bayonets were referred to as M1905, regardless of the construction of their grips.|$|R

50|$|The M4 bayonet was {{introduced}} in 1944 for use with the M1 carbine. It {{was built on the}} M3 fighting knife. Like the M3 fighting knife it was designed for rapid production using a minimum of strategic metals and machine processes, it used a relatively narrow 6.75-inch bayonet-style spear-point blade with a sharpened 3.5-inch secondary edge. The blade was made of carbon steel, and was either blued or parkerized. Production of the grooved leather handle was later simplified by forming the grip of stacked leather washers that were shaped by turning on a lathe, then polished and lacquered. The steel crossguard had an bayonet muzzle ring and the bayonet fastener is on the pommel. Later models used a <b>black</b> <b>molded</b> plastic handle.

R. stolonifer grows rapidly at temperatures between 15 and 30°C.|$|R
