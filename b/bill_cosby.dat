5|$|Created by comedian <b>Bill</b> <b>Cosby,</b> Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite her into a lawyer to reflect a family that closer resembled their own.

Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the role by exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant with their child during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E

Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals.

The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations.
