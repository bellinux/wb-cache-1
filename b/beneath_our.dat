25|$|Votive offerings {{became a}} tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms). Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) {{some of these}} objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings. Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered. Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel. The large {{crescent}} moon located right <b>beneath</b> <b>Our</b> Lady is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849. The crescent goes well with the silver cloth, adding additional parallels with the Woman of the Apocalypse, described in the Book of Revelation as a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.|$|E

40|$|The eastern Himalayan syntaxis {{in southeastern}} Tibet {{consists}} of the Lhasa terrane, High Himalayan rocks and Indus-Tsangpo suture zone. The Lhasa terrane constitutes the hangingwall of a subduction zone, whereas the High Himalayan rocks represent the subducted Indian continent. Our petrological and geochronological data reveal that the Lhasa terrane has undergone two stages of medium-P metamorphism: an early granulite facies event at c. 90 Ma and a late amphibolite facies event at 36 - 33 Ma. However, the High Himalayan rocks experienced only a single high-P granulite facies metamorphic event at 37 - 32 Ma. It is inferred that the Late Cretaceous (c. 90 Ma) medium-P metamorphism of the southern Lhasa terrane resulted from a northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan ocean, and that the Oligocene (37 - 32 Ma) high-P (1. 8 - 1. 4 GPa) rocks of the High Himalayan and coeval medium-P (0. 8 - 1. 1 GPa) rocks of the Lhasa terrane represent paired metamorphic belts that resulted from the northward subduction of the Indian continent <b>beneath</b> Asia. <b>Our</b> results provide robust constraints on the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution of south Tibet. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{crust and}} upper mantle in {{mainland}} China were relatively densely probed with wide-angle seismic pro- filing since 1958, {{and the data}} have provided constraints on the amalgamation and lithosphere deformation of the continent. Based on the collection and digitization of crustal P-wave velocity models along related wide-angle seismic profiles, we construct several crustal transects across major tectonic units in mainland China. In our study, we analyzed the seismic activity, and seismic energy releases during 1970 and 2010 along them. We present seismogenic layer distribution and calculate the yield stress envelopes of the litho- sphere along the transects, yielding {{a better understanding of}} the lithosphere rheology strength <b>beneath</b> mainland China. <b>Our</b> results demonstrate that the crustal thicknesses of different tectonic provinces are distinc- tively different in mainland China. The average crustal thickness is greater than 65 km beneath the Tibetan Plateau, about 35 km beneath South China, and about 36 – 38 km beneath North China and Northeastern China. For the basins, the thickness is ~ 55 km beneath Qaidam, ~ 50 km beneath Tarim, ~ 40 km beneath Sichuan and ~ 35 km <b>beneath</b> Songliao. <b>Our</b> study also shows that the average seismic P-wave velocity is usually slower than the global average, equivalent with a more felsic composition of crust beneath the four tectonic blocks of mainland China resulting from the complex process of lithospheric evolution during Triassic and Cenozoic con- tinent–continent and Mesozoic ocean–continent collisions. We identify characteristically different patterns of seismic activity distribution in different tectonic blocks, with bi-, or even tri-peak distribution of seismic concen- tration in South Tibet, which may suggest that crustal architecture and composition exert important control role in lithosphere deformation. The calculated yield stress envelopes of lithosphere in mainland China can be divided into three groups. The results indicate that the lithosphere rheology structure can be described by jelly sandwich model in eastern China, and crème brulee models with weak and strong lower crust corresponding to lithosphere beneath the western China and Kunlun orogenic belts, respectively. The spatial distribution of lithospheric rhe- ology structure may provide important constraints on understanding of intra- or inter-plate deformation mech- anism, and more studies are needed to further understand the tectonic process(es) accompanying different lithosphere rheology structures...|$|R
40|$|Areas {{of active}} {{volcanism}} contain elaborate velocity structures that complicate interpretations of earthquake source mechanisms. We examine the spectral characteristics of 805 earthquakes that immediately followed a large volume basaltic dike intrusion and associated silicic flank eruption of Dabbahu volcano in the Afar Depression as recorded on near-source seismometers. We use these results {{to quantify the}} contribution of scattering and attenuation to the observed spectra of low-frequency hybrid and volcano-tectonic earthquake clusters from beneath Dabbahu volcano and around the dike zone. We find strong variations in the signal amplitude and frequency content of earthquakes recorded at stations separated by as little as 2 km, caused by preferential attenuation of high frequencies depending on the vantage point. These observations imply that there are large impedance contrasts near the cooling, solidifying, and recently intruded dike. We estimate the intrinsic absorption attenuation coefficient, QI, and inverse scattering length, g 0, averaged over a 300 -sq-km area <b>beneath</b> Dabbahu. <b>Our</b> {{results are consistent with}} the highest attenuation coefficients from studies of volcanic provinces in Italy (QI- 1 ? 0. 02, g 0 ? 0. 1 km- 1 for a signal at 2 Hz).
