[...] Backup applications that have implemented these [...] will simply copy the encrypted file stream and the $EFS alternate data stream as a single file. [...] In other words, the files are [...] "copied" [...] (e.g. into the <b>backup</b> <b>file)</b> in encrypted form, and are not decrypted during backup.|$|E

50|$|A forward incremental-forever backup {{allows the}} {{synthetic}} operation {{to create a}} new full backup, which is limited {{to the size of the}} incremental file, instead of the complete size of a full <b>backup</b> <b>file</b> as it would happen in a “forward mode with synthetic fulls”. The overall consumed I/O is the same as the Reversed incremental, but during the duration of the backup activity only 1 write I/O is used and the snapshot of the VM is opened for less time than the Reversed incremental; the remaining 2 I/O are used to update the full <b>backup</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
50|$|WBAdmin, {{using the}} command line or Graphical User Interface creates a backup {{which can be}} quickly {{restored}} using just the Windows Media install DVD and the backup files located on a removable USB disk without the need to re-install from scratch. WBAdmin uses a clever differencing engine to update the backup files. Once the original <b>backup</b> <b>file</b> is created Volume Shadow Copy Service updates changes, subsequent full backups take a matter of moments rather than many minutes taken to create the original <b>backup</b> <b>file.</b> Automatic backups can be scheduled {{on a regular basis}} using a wizard.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of <b>backup</b> supported: <b>File</b> <b>backup</b> and system image. <b>File</b> <b>backups</b> are saved to ZIP files. Two methods of <b>file</b> <b>backup</b> are supported: The first, normal backup, stores everything selected for backup. The second, incremental <b>backup</b> stores only <b>files</b> that are changed after a previous backup. The other method of backup, system image, is a disk image of the backed up system saved block by block in a VHD file (versus file by file in the <b>file</b> <b>backup</b> and NTBackup). Block-based backup is more efficient at performing subsequent differential backups, as only the blocks that have changed need to be backed up.|$|R
