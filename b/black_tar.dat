Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198mg/L. The blood concentration of morphine, a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06mg/L. For comparison, the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34mg/L.|$|E

25|$|Wound {{botulism}} {{results from}} the contamination of a wound with the bacteria, which then secrete the toxin into the bloodstream. This has become more common in intravenous drug users since the 1990s, especially people using <b>black</b> <b>tar</b> heroin and those injecting heroin into the skin rather than the veins. Wound botulism accounts for 29% of cases.|$|E

Poppy straw as well as opium can yield morphine of purity levels ranging from poppy tea to near-pharmaceutical-grade morphine by itself or with all of the more than 50 other alkaloids.

The visual relationship to Tilst Kirke and the unchanged appearance of the building was also considered important. The house is a half-timbered wattle and daub structure. It is whitewashed with visible <b>black</b> <b>tarred</b> wooden beams, a thatched roof with pointed wooden gables and one brick chimney.|$|R
50|$|On Prospect Hill {{there were}} two mills. The first was called Manwaring's Mill, or Little Mill. It was a <b>black</b> <b>tarred</b> smock mill that drove four pairs of millstones.

2500|$|Every {{show on the}} 1995 {{tour was}} recorded, {{with a view to}} {{releasing}} a genuine [...] "live" [...] album with no studio overdubs.

The resulting album, Headlights, White Lines, <b>Black</b> <b>Tar</b> Rivers was released simultaneously with the video of the same name in August 1996. The album reached No.13 in the UK album charts, and a less extensive UK tour was undertaken in September/October to support the record's release.|$|E
2500|$|Cheese is a {{combination}} of drugs, made by combining heroin with crushed tablets of certain over-the-counter cold medication, such as Tylenol PM. Such cold medications contain acetaminophen (paracetamol), the active ingredient in Tylenol, and the antihistamine diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl. Cheese samples obtained in north Dallas contained between 2% and 8% heroin, in contrast to the 30% commonly found in <b>black</b> <b>tar</b> heroin. [...] Users commonly take the powder by insufflation ("snorting") rather than by intravenous injection. This mixture is also known as [...] "Tylenol With Smack", by analogy to the Tylenol With Codeine series.|$|E

The exhibition building is faced with <b>black</b> <b>tarred</b> wood, and has elements of traditional Faroese building. It is surrounded by trees, as it is situated next to a park. The permanent collection displays some of the best works by William Heinesen, Ingálvur av Reyni and Sámal Mikines. Each year two exhibitions take place that focus exclusively on Faroese artists. The first one is the spring exhibition in May; the second is the annual Saint Olav's Day exhibition in late July. Whereas the first one exclusively features professional artists, the latter one mainly features amateurs.|$|R

60|$|And {{yet when}} I eyed the transfigured scene {{it did not}} seem exactly like a bonfire or any ritual illumination. It was too chaotic, and too close to the houses of the town.

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>tar</b> heroin is heroin acetate. Other {{forms of}} heroin require {{additional}} steps of purification post acetylation.

60|$|The {{next morning}} the sun relented, and the wine of his dawn was wine indeed to our {{flagging}} hopes. Going down to wash at the river's brink, I heard a movement in the cane, and stood frozen and staring until a great, bearded head, <b>black</b> as <b>tar,</b> was thrust out between the stalks {{and looked at me}} with blinking red eyes.

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{notes of}} Grenache are berry fruit such as raspberries and strawberries. When yields {{are kept in}} check, Grenache-based wines can develop complex and intense notes of blackcurrants, black cherries, black olives, coffee, gingerbread, honey, leather, <b>black</b> pepper, <b>tar,</b> spices, and roasted nuts. When yields are increased, more overtly earthy and herbal notes emerge that tend to quickly fade on the palate. The very low-yielding old vines of Priorat can impart dark black fruits and notes of figs and tar with many traits similar to the Italian wine Amarone. Rosado or rosé Grenaches are often characterized by their strawberry and cream notes while fortified vin doux nautrels and Australian [...] "port style" [...] wines exhibits coffee and nutty tawny-like notes.|$|R
