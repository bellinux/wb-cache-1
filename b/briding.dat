5000|$|The series {{itself was}} plagued by delays and {{controversy}} from the very beginning. According to Macan (who was told so by outgoing Captain America editor Andrew Lis), Rieber had {{to back out of}} writing the <b>briding</b> mini-series due to the 9/11 attacks - supposedly, to re-write whatever material he already had to reflect on the event. The first arc, titled The New Deal (February to November 2002) had Captain America questioning the American government - a topic that had worldwide resonance in the press. Rieber's original outline for the series was supposed to start with the second arc, The Extremists, but he left the book halfway into the arc (three finished issues out of five). [...] To finish both The Extremists and Ice (which by the time Rieber left had only one finished issue), Marvel hired Chuck Austen who was also rejected at the launch in favor of Ney Rieber but still agreed to bring his plots to a close.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{mechanical}} circulatory {{support is}} a life-saving technology while <b>briding</b> to heart transplantation. It increases {{the quality of}} life and preserves end-organ function for patients with  advanced heart failure. The number of patients with advanced heart failure scheduled for heart transplantation before comorbidities escalate is on the rise. However, the device function is complicated by the bleeding-thrombosis and infection paradigm, hence the interest in understanding device thrombosis and infection. We describe a 27 -year-old man with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, advanced end-organ failure, and severe infection, who was bridged to heart transplantation after 8 months on the Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) biventricular support. The patient was discharged from the hospital in the third postoperative week after the recovery of his end-organ functions. At 29 months’ post-transplantation follow-up, his last cardiac biopsy was grade 0, his ejection fraction was 60 %, and he was enjoying a good quality of life. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the limiting of the making current in a load circuit, having {{at least one}} limiting resistor switched in series with the load current and a <b>briding</b> component connected to a controller to bridge the limiting resistor. In order to limit the current reliably when the load is switched on, a control and measuring instrument (99) is provided to monitor the operating state of the limiting NTC thermistor (4) which is connected in a control circuit with a bridging component (5) and an interlock component (3) connected in series with the load. If a predefinable resistance for the NTC thermistor (4) is undershot, load power-up is blocked. The starting current can thus not exceed a predefined limit value even if the load is switched on repeatedly after {{a short period of}} time or in sequence. Moreover, the limiting NTC thermistor (4) is protected from overload by switching on and off too often. The device can be implemented without the use of electronic switching elements and is therefore particularly suited for safety-related applications (Fig. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: Family {{members of}} persons with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease may {{experience}} feelings of vulnerability and insecurity as the disease follows its course. Against this background, {{the aim of the}} present study was to explore empowerment in outpatient care as experienced by these family members. Methods: An inductive approach for qualitative data analysis was chosen. The study sample comprised 12 family members of pre-dialysis patients at an outpatient kidney clinic. Two interviews with each family member were subjected to content analysis to gain an understanding of empowerment from the family members' perspective. Results: Having strength to assume the responsibility was the main theme that emerged from the following five sub-themes: Being an involved participant, Having confirming encounters, Trusting in health-care staff, Comprehending through knowledge, and Feeling left out. Four of these five sub-themes were positive. The fifth subtheme illuminated negative experience, indicating the absence of empowerment. Conclusions: Family members' experience of empowerment is dependent on their ability to assume the responsibility for a relative with chronic kidney disease when needed. The findings emphasise the need for a family perspective and the significance of a supportive environment for family members of persons in outpatient care. <b>Briding</b> the Gap...|$|E

40|$|A typical {{completion}} procedure requires {{placement of}} a bridge plug near the liner {{top of a}} producing steam well so the well can be loaded to permit cementing of the tieback casing string by conventional cementing techniques. A drillable bridge plug {{has been used in}} the past so that it could be removed with a conventional toothed, cone-type drill bit. All components could not be drilled out because the bridge plug would separate from the casing when drilling through its top slips. This created a hazardous situation because heavy components remaining in the well could blowout after placing the well into production and damage or destroy surface equipment. A bridge plug and its companion milling-type retrieving tool were developed to perform the bridging operation and accomplish removal in a producing geothermal steam well environment. The bridge plug features an internal <b>briding</b> plug that is designed to permit the release of differential pressure buildup from below before releasing the bridge plug by milling away the top slips. The millinog-type retrieving tool has a catcher mechanism designed to function in the high-velocity steam flow of a producing well to catch the released bridge plug. After the released bridge plug components are caught, they may be returned to the surface in a controlled manner. This removes the massive components so {{that they will not be}} blown out by the steam of a producing well. Field use has demonstrated that this equipment is a practical completion aid, and it is currently being used in The Geysers field of northern California. Examples of field usage are discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Kossuth County {{is located}} in North Central Iowa {{bordering}} on the State of Minnesota. It is the largest county in Iowa consisting of 28 congressional townships. The population of the county is 23, 000 of which 11, 000 people live in the rural area. There are 13 towns located in the county with the county seat, Algona, being the largest {{with a population of}} 6, 100. Major industry of the area is grain farming with some beef and hog production. Naturally, where there is good grain farm land it follows that there is poor soil available for road construction and pavements. However, below the 3 to 4 feet of good farm land of Kossuth there is present a good grade of clay soil which does make an adequate base for surfacing when placed and compacted on top of the roadbed. As early as 1950, the then Kossuth County Engineer, H. M. Smith, embarked on a program of stage construction in building new grades and pavements. The goal of his program was primarily to conserve the county's rapidly dwindling supply of surfacing materials, and also, to realize the side effects of providing smooth and dustless roads for the public. Engineer Smith was fully aware of the poor soils that existed for road construction, but he also knew about the good clay that lay below the farm soil. Consequently, in his grading program he insisted that road ditches be dug deep enough to allow the good clay soil to be compacted on top of the roadbed. The presence of the compacted clay on top of the road resulted in a <b>briding</b> affect over the farm soil. The stage construction program satisfied the objectives of aggregate construction and dust control but did generate other problems which we are now trying to solve as economically as possible...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{report in}} this paper some initial results {{generated}} from an integration exercise held in October of 2011 in Munich (Germany) at the Rohde & Schwarz premises using Software Defined Radios (SDRs) for actual public safety applications. The SDR technology is being produced to benefit the International Public Safety Community, and partly funded by the European Commision (EC) under the Framework 7 programme. Specifically, this project is called EULER (EUropean SDR for wireless in joint security) operations. Project EULER is bringing together a number of European Industries and Acedemia for maturing the aspect of SDR with security, as would be necessary for rapid and international communication. EULER {{has given rise to}} the initial effort to forge together an international collaborative effort, which is yielding a SDR approach with the additional matter of integrated networks. The underlying technology is SDR, with, some of the networks using conventional Standards such as TETRA and WiMAX and there is some Ethernet wired network connectivity. This approach has been necessary to yeild a practical realisation of an SDR network, which can then augment elements of the ensuing network to yeild a more ubiqutious SDR solution, perhaps in a EULER 2 system. Whilst the offering in EULER is a SDR network, a number of platform and waveform innovations can be seen, which are elements of an SDR system that is necessary for <b>briding</b> a wireless network together to enable international public safety. We report {{in this paper}} upon these innovations and the progress made to this date. The public safety community is perceived to be TETRA based, which offers a low data rate, order of tens of kilobits/s, and is used mainly for voice communications. The TETRA system offers a level of security, as would be expected for delivering Public Safety. Clearly, Public Safety has now evolved to a need for secure widerband communications (order of Mbps); to enable Video, Data and Assured Multilevel Services to be used. EULER is enabling a High Data Rate (HDR) waveform (WF) to connect together a number of public safety communities through <b>briding</b> the various TETRA networks; the EULER WF (EWF) has been produced for linking together a number of Public Safety Communities for HDR services for a Line of Sight (LOS) network. We briefly discuss the EWF Backbone verification and testing which has been generated on a number of SDR systems including the Thales Internet Protocol BaseBand (IPBB) platform and the Astrium Proteus SDR system. In addition, the network links together a real-time, in threate situational awareness via the use of both the EWF and the WiMAX System, which is being supplied by Cassidian, to brige to the TETRA. There is a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) element being supplied by Astrium which offers a minimum of two WFs running on an Astrium SDR system, Proteus, to cater for interference - like in a situation similar to an earthquake which may give rise to rouge radio transmission. It is envisaged that, from an operational standpoint, the scenario mentioned here will allow the formation of a Common Operational Picture (COP) using both HDR LOS and BLOS services within an SDR environment, to allow multi-level and secure operation facilitating a rapid formation of an infrastrucure for the Public Safety Community. Whereas the conventional form of BLOS is the provision of reachback for SATCOM, mandating a single disaster zone relative to the BLOS scheme, here it is assumed that a potential exists for a double disaster zone; the second being a consequence of the human displacement following the initial disaster. This scenario implies a need for a HDR capability {{on both sides of the}} BLOS link, mandating a need in this case for a WiMAX BS on either end of the BLOS link - implying a minimum of two BSs. The discussion provided in this paper details some of the EULER achievements at this Integration stage particularly as the network is validated giving rise to new realisations of connectivity and thus a new range of applications for the public safety community; the final demonstration will be held in the Netherlands in approximately April 2012...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Foamy viruses (FVs) unlike orthoretroviruses express Pol as a {{separate}} precursor protein {{and not as a}} Gag-Pol fusion protein. A unique packaging strategy, involving recognition of <b>briding</b> viral RNA by both Pol precursor and Gag as well as potential Gag-Pol protein interactions, ensures Pol particle encapsidation. Results Several Prototype FV (PFV) Gag-Pol fusion protein constructs were generated to examine whether PFV replication is compatible with an orthoretroviral-like Pol expression. During their analysis, non-particle-associated secreted Pol precursor protein was discovered in extracellular wild type PFV particle preparations of different origin, copurifying in simple virion enrichment protocols. Different analysis methods suggest that extracellular wild type PFV particles contain predominantly mature p 85 PR-RT and p 40 IN Pol subunits. Characterization of various PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs revealed that PFV Pol expression in an orthoretroviral manner is compatible with PFV replication as long as a proteolytic processing between Gag and Pol proteins is possible. PFV Gag-Pol translation by a HIV- 1 like ribosomal frameshift signal resulted in production of replication-competent virions, although cell- and particle-associated Pol levels were reduced in comparison to wild type. In-frame fusion of PFV Gag and Pol ORFs led to increased cellular Pol levels, but particle incorporation was only marginally elevated. Unlike that reported for similar orthoretroviral constructs, a full-length in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion construct showed wildtype-like particle release and infectivity characteristics. In contrast, in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion with C-terminal Gag ORF truncations or non-removable Gag peptide addition to Pol displayed wildtype particle release, but reduced particle infectivity. PFV Gag-Pol precursor fusion proteins with inactivated protease were highly deficient in regular particle release, although coexpression of p 71 Gag resulted in a significant copackaging of these proteins. Conclusions Non-particle associated PFV Pol appears to be naturally released from infected cells by a yet unknown mechanism. The absence of particle-associated Pol precursor suggests its rapid processing upon particle incorporation. Analysis of different PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs demonstrates that orthoretroviral-like Pol expression is compatible with FV replication in principal as long as fusion protein processing is possible. Furthermore, unlike orthoretroviruses, PFV particle release and infectivity tolerate larger differences in relative cellular Gag/Pol levels. </p...|$|E

This study aims to input the real - world design context into the BIM pedagogy and to demons trate the capacity of BIM in e n- hancing teamwork in the cross - disciplinary collaboration. Methodology / Approach – A case study of a Saint Lucia - based residential house project was adopted by utilizing BIM as the platform {{to carry on the}} redesign plan di ffering from an existing design. Nine different student design teams from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each team consisting of students from architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked in the BIM - based platform to provide solutions on architectural model, stru c- tural design, cost estimate, and sustainability in terms of energy efficiency. Each team’s design plan was presented and evaluated by academics, the client, and construction professionals. Results – The case study demonstrates the capacity of BIM in assisting the cross - disciplinary project design. BIM learners gained the practical experience in the team design work. As the pr o- ject deliverable, different design plans were evaluated by the cli ent and the contractor for fu rther developments. The BIM project experience from team members wa s also presente d in this study. Key Findings / Implications – The BIM education provides the insights of how colleague educ a- tion could equip students with the state - of - the - art learning experience by incorporating the real - world project into the BIM pedagogy. BIM, as the coordination platform, could be fully utilized to implement the building design. This case project serves as an example of <b>briding</b> the gap b etween BIM academia and industry.

40|$|The {{suspicion}} {{of child abuse}} is a massive incrimination, the consequences are far-ranging for every involved participant. A special kind of child abuse is the shaken-baby-syndrome. It includes serious injury and is difficult to prove. Solid arguments are necessary to confirm the suspicion. Usually there will be typical clinical evidence (rupture of <b>briding</b> veins, bonefractures, subdural haematomas). If not, {{it is necessary to}} examine the further clinical evidence. Cerebral fluid collections are not typical clinical evidence of shaken-baby-syndrome. This paper is intended to clarify if cerebral fluid collections develop spontaneously or are triggered by traumata. Furthermore the question, if typical clinical evidence or symptoms can be identified and used to differentiate spontaneous from traumatic, should be answered. Methods Retrospektive all autopsied cases with the {{suspicion of}} shaken-baby-syndrome of the Institut für Rechtsmedizin were examined. Via pubmed, a literature research with the search theme “subdural hygroma” and restricted by age (0 to 23 months) and only humans, was done. Results Between 1982 and 2005 twenty cases with suspicion of shaken-baby-syndrome were autopsied. Four of them with subdural hygromas. Additional clinical evidence was the rupture of bridging veins and retinal hemorrhage. The mean survival time was 25 days. 1392 cases corresponding to search items were found in the literature. 242 infants showed cerebral fluid collections in combination with a causal trauma. Thereof 180 with non-accidental head injuries: (shaken-baby-syndrome, shaken-whiplash-syndrome, violence to the head). In contrast 458 cases with a spontaneous cerebral fluid collection and Macrocranie; some of them with additional symptoms of rising intracranial pressure, a smaller part of them only had macrocranie. Discussion Cerebral fluid collection appears spontaneously or is triggered traumaticly. Spontaneous CSF occurs with macrocranie and possibly with symptoms of rising intracranial pressure. CSF themselves are not described as a trigger for massive brain damage or breathing arrest. CSF is not evidentiary for or against shaken-baby-syndrome. Subdural hygromas were never found in cases of traffic accidents. It is necessary to set CSF in a qualified relation to the whole situation and anamnesis, when child abuse is suspected.

40|$|Abstract – The mixed-valence triiron {{complexes}} [Fe 3 (CO) 7 -x(PPh 3) x(µ-edt) 2] (x = 0, 1, 2; edt = SCH 2 CH 2 S) and [Fe 3 (CO) 5 (κ 2 -diphosphine) (µ-edt) 2] (diphosphine = dppv, dppe, dppb, dppn) {{have been}} prepared and structurally characterized. In comparison to the diiron complex [Fe 2 (CO) 6 (µ-edt) ], [Fe 3 (CO) 7 (µ-edt) 2] catalyzes proton reduction at 0. 36 V less negative potentials, which is a significant energetic gain. In all complexes the HOMO comprises an iron-iron bonding orbital localized between the two iron atoms not ligated by the semi-bridging carbonyl, while the LUMO is highly delocalised in nature and is anti-bonding between both pairs of iron atoms but also contains an anti-bonding dithiolate interaction. The clusters [Fe 3 (CO) 9 (μ 3 -E) 2] (E = S, Se, Te), [Fe 3 (CO) 7 (μ 3 -E) 2 (μ- κ 2 -diphosphine) ] (E = S, Se, Te), [Fe 3 (CO) 7 (μ 3 -CO) (μ 3 -E) (μ-dppm) ] (E = S, Se) and [Fe 3 (CO) 8 (µ 3 -Te) 2 (κ 2 -diphosphine) ] {{have been prepared}} and examined as proton reduction catalysts. The reduction potentials for the tellurium-capped clusters occur at lower potentials than for their sulfur and selenium analogues, and the redox processes also show better reversibility than for the S/Se analogues. The 52 -electron clusters [Fe 3 (CO) 8 (µ 3 -Te) 2 (κ 2 -diphosphine) ] consist of Fe 2 (CO) 6 (µ-Te) 2 “butterfly” units that are capped by a Fe(CO) 2 (κ 2 -diphosphine) moiety. Cyclic voltammetry studies reveal that their redox behaviour and properties as proton reduction catalysts largely stem from the Fe 2 (CO) 6 (µ-Te) 2 entities, although computational modelling indicates that their LUMOs are centered on the <b>briding</b> tellurium ions and the unique “capping” iron ion. The influence of the substitution, orientation {{and structure of the}} phosphido bridges on the electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of [Fe 2 (CO) 6 (µ-phosphido) 2] clusters and bis(phosphinidene) -capped triiron carbonyl clusters, including electron-rich derivatives formed by substitution with chelating diphosphines, have been studied. The electrochemistry and electrocatalyses of the [Fe 2 (CO) 6 (µ-PR 2) 2] dimers show subtle variations with the nature of the bridging phosphido group(s), including the orientation of bridgehead hydrogen atoms. The reduction potential of the phosphinidene- capped clusters shift negative way to increase the electron density on the iron centers...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{accounts}} for about 35 {{percent of the total}} Swedish energy consumption and most of the energy is used by the large housing stock from the so-called “Million program”.   In the national action plan the government has put forward in energy efficiency. It is mentioned that existing buildings account for more than 90 percent of what {{is expected to be the}} housing stock within the coming 50 years. In order to meet environmental objectives its required that the existing stock be reviewed for energy efficiency.   The goverment is now initiating a national framework with a budget of SEK 300 million Swedish crowns per year for five years, starting in 2010 to achieve the goal on energy efficient buildings. Energy efficiency of buildings in both new construction and above all within the existing stock are addressed. In order to use this money as effectively as possible it is necessary to have a good plan, and adequate knowledge of minimizing energy use in the buildings will be done the possible way.   In Germany, the use of Passive House technology have been successive and increases with steady pace. In Sweden we have not come as far. It is mainly in new production that the Passive House concept has been suitable in Germany, but it has also been proven that it is possible to refurbish buildings similar to the so-called Million program houses to Passive Houses. Prefabricated facade elements have been used to this puspose.   This is a technology that is still unknown of in Sweden. It has good potential to be developed towards the industrialization of the prefabricated components aimed for the refurbishment of the Million program stock.   Meanwhile Swedish contractors are waiting for results from a refurbishment project in the city of Alinsås, where buildings in the neighborhood Brogården were recently renovated with Passive House technology. The first measurement data will be available by the spring 2010. Alingsås has launched a starting point for the Swedish construction industry with a cencept that applies passive house technology?   This work has studied how the construction industry looks at the refurbishment of the Million program stock to Passive Houses and wheater a smiliar concept as the one used in Germany with prefabricated facade elements are interesting for the Swedish market today. Literature study was carried out on the Passive House concept and on the German model. A series of interviews with various stakeholders from the construction industry was conducted.   The findings are that there is not much interest to refurbish the stock of Million program towards Passive Houses. However, there is an interest for a large refurbishment towards low energy houses. In this concept, aspects of the Passive House concept are taken and adapted to the refurbishment towards low energy houses.

40|$|Although the {{transition}} metal chemistry of many dialkylamido ligands {{has been well}} studied, the chemistry of the bulky di(tert-butyl) amido ligand has been largely overlooked. The di(tert-butyl) amido ligand is well suited for synthesizing transition metal compounds with low coordination numbers; such compounds may exhibit interesting structural, physical, and chemical properties. Di(tert-butyl) amido complexes of transition metals are expected to exhibit high volatilities and low decomposition temperatures, thus making them well suited for the chemical vapor deposition of metals and metal nitrides. Treatment of MnBr₂(THF) ₂, FeI₂, CoBr₂(DME), or NiBr₂(DME) with two equivalents of LiN(t-Bu) 2 in benzene affords the two-coordinate complex M[N(t-Bu) ₂]₂, where M is Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni. Crystallographic {{studies show that the}} M-N distances decrease across the series: 1. 9365 (Mn), 1. 8790 (Fe), 1. 845 (Co), 1. 798 Å (Ni). The N-M- N angles are very close to linear for Mn and Fe (179. 30 and 179. 45 °, respectively), but bent for Co and Ni (159. 2 and 160. 90 °, respectively). As expected, the d⁵ Mn complex has a magnetic moment of 5. 53 μΒ that is very close to the spin only value. The EPR spectrum is nearly axial with a low E/D ratio of 0. 014. The d⁶ Fe compound has a room temperature magnetic moment of 5. 55 μΒ indicative of a large orbital angular momentum contribution. It does not exhibit a Jahn-Teller distortion despite the expected doubly degenerate ground state. Applied field Mössbauer spectroscopy shows that the effective internal hyperfine field is unusually large, Hint = 105 T. The magnetic moments of Co[N(t-Bu) ₂]₂ and Ni[N(t-Bu) ₂]₂ are 5. 24 and 3. 02 μΒ respectively. Both are EPR silent at 4. 2 K. Treatment of TiCl₄ with three equivalents of LiN(t-Bu) 2 in pentane affords the <b>briding</b> imido compound Ti₂[μ-N(t-Bu) ]₂Cl₂[N(t-Bu) ₂]₂ via a dealkylation reaction. Rotation around the bis(tert-butyl) amido groups is hindered, with activation parameters of ΔH‡ = 12. 8 ± 0. 6 kcal mol- 1 and ΔS‡ = - 8 ± 2 cal K- 1 ·mol- 1, as evidenced by variable temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Treatment of TiCl₄ with two equivalents of HN(t-Bu) ₂ affords Ti₂Cl₆[N(t-Bu) ₂]₂. This complex shows a close-contact of 2. 634 (3) Å between Ti and the carbon atom of one of the CH₃ substituents on the tert-butyl groups. Theoretical considerations and detailed structural comparisons suggest this interaction is not agostic in nature, but rather is a consequence of interligand repulsions. Treatment of NiI₂(PPh 3) ₂ and PdCl₂(PPh₃) ₂ with LiN(t-Bu) ₂in benzene affords Ni[N(t-Bu) ₂](PPh₃) I and Pd₃(μ₂-NBut₂) 2 (μ₂-PPh₂) Ph(PPh₃) respectively. The compound Ni[N(t-Bu) ₂](PPh₃) I has distorted T-shape in geometry, whereas Pd₃(μ₂-NBut₂) ₂(μ₂-PPh₂) Ph(PPh₃) contains a triangular palladium core. Manganese nitride films were grown from Mn[N(t-Bu) ₂]₂ in the presence of anhydrous ammonia. The growth rate was several nanometers per minute even at the remarkably low temperature of 80 ⁰C. As grown, the films are carbon- and oxygen-free, and have a columnar morphology. The spacings between the columns become smaller and the films become smoother as the growth temperature is increased. The composition of the films is consistent with a stoichiometry of Mn₅N₂...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the participation {{of women in the}} labour market and source of policy-marking interest in the subject can be considered from various points of view. First, a higher average degree of female education, and the changing of cultural models regarding the division of roles within the family, have resulted in a higher preference by women for work on the market. Second, interest in this issue also aries from the deep changes that have occured, and still occur, within the family structure: the older age at which families are started and the rise of divorce and separation contribute to the spreading of families headed by single women, who cannot rely on a spouse for economic support. Finally, the rise of female employment is vitally important for the sustainability of social protection system, in a context defined by the fast and relevant ageing of the population and by the widespread reduction in fertility rates. The latter phenomenon is extrremely relevant in Italy, where the fertility rate is one of the lowest among OECD countries. According to forecasts, by 2020 the eldeerly dependency index - i. e. the ratio of population above age 64 to the working age population (age rank 15 - 64) - will surpass 30 % (Visco, 2000). The low fertility rate implies the impossibility of increasing labour supply through demographic dynamics; an increase in female labour force becomes, therefore, a fundamental tool for the overall growth of employment. The increse in female employment is an important goal also at Eurpean level: <b>briding</b> the gap between the female employment rates in the EU and the USA would increase the number of employed women in Europe by 21 milion (European Commission, 2000), and Eurpean policy makers believe that the EU "must set itself the goal of restoring full employment as the key objective of economic and social policy" (European Commission, 2000). In light of this, the Lisbon strategy states that the female employment rate in the European Union should reach 60 % by 2010, up from 51 % now. Meeting this goal is an especially difficult task for Italy, where the female employment rate in 2001 was 41. 6 %. The participation rate was also much lower than 60 % - in the same year it was at 48 % - indicating how distant the Lisbon target is, {{even in the absence of}} unemployment. Indeed, in Italy women employment is low not only because female unemployment rate is high, but also because partecipation rate is small; the latter can be seen as an indication of "volontary" non-employment. Therefore, the partecipation rate is the first issue to address if the goal is to increase female employment. Figure 1 shows the female employment, unemployment and partecipation rates in Italy and in the European Union from 1979 to 2001. From the graph one can infer two especially interesting phenomena. First, there is a marked increase in the rates of female employment and partecipation both in Italy and the EU, while the ratio of unemployed women to working age female population and the unemployment rate do not vary greatly. This suggest that the better employment performance of women over the last 20 years is largely tied to a shifting of preference towards jobs on the market, rather than better demand conditions...|$|E
