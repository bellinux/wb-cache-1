5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a <b>board</b> <b>president,</b> 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The <b>board</b> <b>president</b> was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{summarize}} the historical background, or setting, of school reorganization in Nebraska, and to ascertain the perceptions of school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> in rural areas regarding school reorganization. The sample included 200 school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> from K- 8 (Class I) school districts in which reorganization had not taken place and 52 rural K- 12 school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> which had experienced reorganization during the years 1980 to 1985. ^ After review of pertinent literature, an 18 -item questionnaire was developed and distributed to the respondents in the study. In order to determine if there were significant differences between the perceptions of the K- 8 school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> and the K- 12 school <b>board</b> <b>presidents,</b> the null hypotheses formulated for the study were tested by use of a critical ratio or t-test. ^ The findings of the study included: (1) Legal procedures for the development of reorganized school districts have been clearly outlined by the Nebraska Legislature. (2) The K- 8 school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> perceived that parents would have less control over their children 2 Ì† 7 s education if reorganization took place and that consolidation would result in a loss of local control, whereas K- 12 school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> indicated reorganization did not result in loss of local control. (3) <b>Board</b> <b>presidents</b> from K- 8 and K- 12 school districts disagreed about the advantages and disadvantages of school district reorganization. Presidents of K- 8 districts did not feel reorganization was a priority, while K- 12 presidents strongly agreed that reorganization of public schools should be a priority. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{attitudes toward}} health {{education}} questionnaire {{was developed to}} determine and compare the attitudes of superintendents, school <b>board</b> <b>presidents,</b> and principals. The sample population consisted of superintendents, school <b>board</b> <b>presidents,</b> and principals in a stratified random sample of 80 school districts. The school districts were stratified according to enrollment size. A total of 258 subjects were mailed questionnaires and a 77 % (199) return of mailed questionnaires was obtained. The data collected from returned questionnaires was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, unequal cell frequency, and a one-way ANOVA, unequal 1 cell frequency, to determine statistical significance at the p</=. 05 level. A Scheffe' post-hoc {{test was used to}} locate mean scores where a significant difference was revealed from the one-way ANOVA. This statistical analysis of the data revealed {{a significant difference between the}} attitudes of principals and school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> toward health education. There was no significant difference between the attitudes of superintendents and principals or superintendents and school <b>board</b> <b>presidents.</b> The attitudes of superintendents, principals, and school <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> do not vary according to school district size. It was concluded that principals have a significantly more positive attitude toward health education than do school <b>board</b> <b>presidents...</b>|$|R

5|$|When Hong Taiji died in 1643, he was {{replaced}} by the young Shunzhi Emperor and two co-regents: Dorgon and Jirgalang. In 1644, under their leadership, the Qing dynasty defeated the weakened Ming dynasty and moved its capital to Beijing. The Deliberative Council of Ministers was Dorgon's main policymaking body during his regency. Soon after moving to Beijing, he gave the Council control over both military and civil affairs, and expanded its membership to all lieutenant-generals and deputy lieutenant-generals in the Manchu and Mongol Banners, as well as to all Mongols and Manchus who held posts of Grand Secretary or <b>Board</b> <b>president.</b> Far from limiting Dorgon's power, the Council served as his tool to denounce and arraign other princes who challenged his authority. In May 1644, for instance, he had Hong Taiji's son Hooge accused of seditious behavior and made Hooge's enemies testify against him in front of the Council. He used the same method to purge Hooge for good in 1648.|$|E

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 271 p. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the perceptions of Illinois high school district superintendents and <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> regarding the nature and frequency of conflict between superintendents and boards and the behaviors used by each referent group to manage conflict situations. The study used a dual-design approach, descriptive survey, and causal comparative method. Two self-administered questionnaires were developed by the researcher [...] one for superintendents and another for <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> [...] to identify the important issues and frequency of conflict between superintendents and boards. The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) was used to determine the conflict-handling behaviors of superintendents and <b>board</b> <b>presidents.</b> The universal population of all the superintendents and their respective <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> of all the high-school districts in Illinois (108) was used for this study. Questionnaires were returned by 62 superintendents (58 %) and by 48 <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> (45 %). Along with numbers, percentages, and rankings, chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Spearman rho, correlation coefficients were used to analyze the data. The major findings showed that the five most important issues that cause conflict between superintendents and boards were identified by superintendents as (a) Micro-managing by board, (b) Communication Failures, (c) Intra-board Power Struggles, (d) Personnel Matters, and (e) Financial Matters. School <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> identified (a) Communication Failures, (b) Financial Matters, (c) Personnel Matters, (d) Athletic Programs, and (e) Micro-managing as their five most important issues that cause conflict. Regarding the frequency of conflict between superintendents and boards as perceived by superintendents and <b>board</b> <b>presidents,</b> the results show that only one conflict issue [...] Role Expectations and Interpretations [...] was statistically significant. The TKI classifies conflict-handling modes into a five-category scheme: competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, and accommodating. The data from this instrument revealed that superintendents most often used the Accommodating and Compromising modes. <b>Board</b> <b>presidents</b> most often used Compromising and Avoiding modes. The Competing mode was least used by both referent groups. Avoiding was the only conflict-handling mode found to be statistically significant. As a result of this study, it was concluded that (a) <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> perceived that there are more issues that cause conflict between superintendents and boards and that those issues cause a greater strain on the superintendent/board relationship than perceived by superintendents; (b) <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> and superintendents in rural communities perceived there to be more conflict between them regarding athletic programs than did those from other types of communities; (c) superintendents and <b>board</b> <b>presidents</b> used different primary styles of handling conflict, and (d) lack of conflict-management training for superintendents and boards and lack of established procedures for conflict resolution/management for superintendents and board members were found to be statistically associated with many conflict issues...|$|R
