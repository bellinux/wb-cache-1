5|$|At {{the time}} NFF awarded an annual license to clubs which {{permitted}} {{them to play}} in the top two divisions. This included a series of criteria that the home venue needed to meet. As Briskeby was severely substandard to the criteria, Ham-Kam was required to apply for annual exemptions. These were only awarded to clubs who were actively working on upgrading or building new venues. If an exception was not granted, the club would either <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the Second Division (the third tier), or would have to play their home games at an approved stadium in another town.|$|E

5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{entered the}} FA Cup, the {{foremost}} cup competition in England, in the Fifth Qualifying Round {{along with all}} the other teams in the Third Division North. For their first match, played on 29 November 1924, the team was drawn to play Winsford United of the Cheshire County League at Seedhill. Nelson won the first ever meeting between the two clubs 4–1 with goals from Braidwood, Eddleston, O'Beirne and Wolstenholme, to progress to the Sixth Qualifying Round {{for the first time in}} three years. In the next round Nelson were again given a home tie, against Second Division outfit Coventry City, who would <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the Third Division North at the end of the 1924–25 campaign. Nelson made only one change from the side that had defeated Winsford, with Eddie Cameron replacing Arthur Wolstenholme. In front of a crowd of 7,000 spectators, one of the highest attendances at Seedhill of the season, Coventry won 1–0 to progress to the first round proper of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Midland Alliance's 20-year existence, the Regional League has {{accepted}} and, after the Midland League was re-formed, continues to accept applications for membership from successful teams in smaller local leagues within its catchment area. Leagues whose clubs {{have joined the}} Regional League include the Shropshire County League, the Herefordshire League, the Wolverhampton Combination, and the Kidderminster & District League. Several ambitious local Sunday league teams have also switched to Saturday play and entered the league. Bewdley Town, Bromyard Town and Ellesmere Rangers have all joined from county leagues since 1994 and subsequently gone on to gain promotion to the Premier Division. Regional League teams could also theoretically <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the local leagues but in practice this almost never happens. The only teams in recent history to drop down to a county league have been Leominster Town, Kington Town and Hinton, who dropped down to the Herefordshire League in 2004, 2006 and 2007 respectively, although all three clubs resigned voluntarily in favour of playing in a more local league {{as opposed to being}} relegated due to finishing {{at the bottom of the}} table.|$|E
5|$|Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned her to {{consider}} marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would <b>be</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner {{and his allies}} opposed it {{on the basis of}} patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear of Catholicism. When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt's rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane. Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.|$|E
