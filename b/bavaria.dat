5|$|In 1811, <b>Bavaria</b> legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' pound as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of <b>Bavaria.</b> From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of <b>Bavaria,</b> became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of <b>Bavaria,</b> and with a long delay. The apothecaries' pound of 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E
5|$|Otto {{was born}} as Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of <b>Bavaria</b> at Schloss Mirabell in Salzburg (when it briefly {{belonged to the}} Kingdom of <b>Bavaria),</b> as second son of Crown Prince Ludwig I of <b>Bavaria</b> and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. His father served there as Bavarian governor-general. Through his ancestor, the Bavarian Duke John II, Otto was a {{descendant}} of the Greek imperial dynasties of Komnenos and Laskaris.|$|E

5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of <b>Bavaria,</b> the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of <b>Bavaria,</b> who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of <b>Bavaria.</b> In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the electorate, raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the electorate, Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Charles of <b>Bavaria</b> needed {{military}} assistance {{to take the}} imperial title by force, which he secured the treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected their troops into Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had {{taken advantage of the}} chaos in Austria and <b>Bavaria</b> to annex Silesia.|$|E

5|$|Gebhard's {{eventual}} defeat {{changed the}} balance of power in the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1589, Ernst of <b>Bavaria</b> became uncontested Prince-elector of Cologne, the first Wittelsbach to hold the position. Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories endured until the mid-18th century, with the election of a succession of Bavarian princes to the archbishop's throne and to the Prince-Elector's seat. This gave the family two voices in the choice of imperial candidates, which had ramifications in the 18th century. In 1740, Charles Albert, Duke of <b>Bavaria,</b> laid claim to the imperial title; his brother Klemens August of <b>Bavaria,</b> then the Archbishop and Prince-elector, cast his vote for Charles and personally crowned him at Frankfurt am Main. The shift of the emperor's orb from the House of Habsburg to the Wittelsbach family, albeit a brief event, was only resolved by the ascension of Maximilian III Joseph who, with the Treaty of Füssen, eschewed any imperial pretensions.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of <b>Bavaria,</b> {{a member of the}} royal family of <b>Bavaria,</b> who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, George {{resigned}} as field marshal, never {{to go on}} active service again. In 1710, he was granted the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Empire, an office formerly held by the Elector Palatine—the absence of the Elector of <b>Bavaria</b> allowed a reshuffling of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy {{the balance of power}} in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but was removed from the French line of succession, and the Elector of <b>Bavaria</b> was restored.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Bavaria's</b> {{entry into}} the Empire, Ludwig II became {{increasingly}} detached from <b>Bavaria's</b> political affairs and spent vast amounts of money on personal projects, such as {{the construction of a}} number of fairytale castles and palaces, the most famous being the Wagnerian-style Castle Neuschwanstein. Ludwig used his personal wealth to finance these projects, and not state funds, and the construction projects landed him deeply in debt. These debts caused much concern among <b>Bavaria's</b> political elite, who sought to persuade Ludwig to cease his building; he refused, and relations between the government's ministers and the crown deteriorated.|$|R

She was launched on 17February 1912 and christened by Princess Theresa of Bavaria; LudwigIII, the last king of <b>Bavaria</b> and the son of the ship's namesake, Luitpold, Prince Regent of <b>Bavaria,</b> gave a speech. After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 19August 1913. Prinzregent Luitpold was equipped with facilities for a squadron commander, and became the flagship of the IIIBattle Squadron upon commissioning.|$|E

5|$|Scientology {{first became}} active in Germany in 1970.

Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden-Württemberg, and three in <b>Bavaria.</b> Following German re-unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic; most adherents are found in Baden-Württemberg, <b>Bavaria</b> and North Rhine-Westphalia.|$|E

5|$|The Allied commanders now {{marched to}} Friedberg, {{watching}} their enemy {{across the river}} Lech in Augsburg, {{at the same time}} preventing them from entering <b>Bavaria</b> or drawing from it any supplies. But the transfer of <b>Bavaria</b> from the party of the Two Crowns to the Grand Alliance was the prime concern to the Allies. As the Elector sat behind his defences at Augsburg Marlborough sent his troops deep into <b>Bavaria</b> on raids of destruction, burning buildings and destroying crops, trying to lure the Bavarian commander into battle or convince him to change his allegiance back to Emperor Leopold I. The Emperor had offered a full pardon, as well as subsidies and restoration of all his territories, with additional lands of Pfalz-Neuburg and Burgau if he returned to the Imperial fold, but negotiations between the parties were making little headway.|$|E
