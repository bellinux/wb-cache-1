25|$|The 1917 {{synthesis}} by Robinson {{is considered}} a classic in total synthesis due to its simplicity and <b>biomimetic</b> approach. Tropinone is a bicyclic molecule, but the reactants used in its preparation are fairly simple: succinaldehyde, methylamine and acetonedicarboxylic acid (or even acetone). The synthesis {{is a good example}} of a <b>biomimetic</b> reaction or biogenetic-type synthesis because biosynthesis makes use of the same building blocks. It also demonstrates a tandem reaction in a one-pot synthesis. Furthermore, the yield of the synthesis was 17% and with subsequent improvements exceeded 90%.|$|E
25|$|It {{is hoped}} that {{developments}} in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using <b>biomimetic</b> principles. However, Drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by <b>biomimetic</b> means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification. The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book Nanosystems.|$|E

25|$|A {{more recent}} <b>biomimetic</b> {{approach}} by Shair uses beta-thioketoacids as the nucleophile. The ketoacid moiety is decarboxylated in situ. The process {{is similar to}} the way malonyl-CoA is used by Polyketide synthases. The chiral ligand is case is a bisoxazoline. Interestingly, aromatic and branched aliphatic aldehydes are typically poor substrates.|$|E
25|$|New {{biomaterials}} {{have been}} engineered to have ideal properties and functional customization: injectability, synthetic manufacture, biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, transparency, nano-scale fibers, low concentration, resorption rates, etc. PuraMatrix, originating from the MIT labs of Zhang, Rich, Grodzinsky and Langer {{is one of}} these new <b>biomimetic</b> scaffold families which has now been commercialized and is impacting clinical tissue engineering.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} at CSIRO proved {{that they could}} encapsulate biomolecules during the MOF crystallization process. Biomolecules including proteins, DNA and antibodies could be encapsulated within ZIF-8. Enzymes encapsulated in this way were stable and active even after being exposed to harsh conditions (e.g. aggressive solvents and high temperature). ZIF-8, MIL-88A, HKUST-1, and several luminescent MOFs containing lanthanide metals {{were used for the}} <b>biomimetic</b> mineralization process.|$|E
25|$|In certain organisms, ammonia is {{produced}} from atmospheric nitrogen by enzymes called nitrogenases. The overall process is called nitrogen fixation. Although {{it is unlikely}} that <b>biomimetic</b> methods that are competitive with the Haber process will be developed, intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe7MoS9 ensemble.|$|E

25|$|Synergism often {{occurs when}} two {{elements}} are combined; {{it is an}} interaction between two elements that causes an effect greater than the combined effects of each element separately. Synergism {{is evident in the}} combining of scaffold material and topography with cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors, and <b>biomimetic</b> materials. Investigation of synergism is the next step after individual techniques have proven to be successful by themselves. The combinations of these different factors need to be carefully studied in order to optimize synergistic effects.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} been used to make {{biologic}} tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively. Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and <b>biomimetic</b> materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration. The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical integrity, controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{second class}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings are hydrophilic coatings. They rely on high amounts of hydration {{in order to}} increase the energetic penalty of removing water for proteins and microorganisms to attach. The most common examples of these coatings are based on highly hydrated zwitterions, such as glycine betaine and sulfobetaine. These coatings are also low-friction, but are considered by some to be superior to hydrophobic surfaces because they prevent bacteria attachment, preventing biofilm formation. These coatings are not yet commercially available and are being designed {{as part of a larger}} effort by the Office of Naval Research to develop environmentally safe <b>biomimetic</b> ship coatings.|$|E
25|$|One {{trend of}} {{research}} {{is the study of}} the relationship between wettability and anti-fouling effectiveness. Another trend is the study of living organisms as the inspiration for new functional materials. An example of <b>biomimetic</b> antifouling research was conducted at the University of Florida into how marine animals such as dolphins and sharks are able to effectively deter biofouling on their skin. Researchers examined the nanoscale structure of sharks and designed an anti-fouling surface known commercially as Sharklet. Studies show that the nanoscale topologies function not only due to the reduction of sites for macrofoulers to attach, but also due to the same thermodynamic barrier that any surface with low wettability presents.|$|E
25|$|Powerful {{developments}} in the multidisciplinary field of tissue engineering have yielded a novel set of tissue replacement parts and implementation strategies. Scientific advances in biomaterials, stem cells, growth and differentiation factors, and <b>biomimetic</b> environments have created unique opportunities to fabricate tissues in the laboratory from combinations of engineered extracellular matrices ("scaffolds"), cells, and biologically active molecules. Among the major challenges now facing tissue engineering {{is the need for}} more complex functionality, as well as both functional and biomechanical stability and vascularization in laboratory-grown tissues destined for transplantation. The continued success of tissue engineering, and the eventual development of true human replacement parts, will grow from the convergence of engineering and basic research advances in tissue, matrix, growth factor, stem cell, and developmental biology, as well as materials science and bio informatics.|$|E

[...] "Moth-eye" [...] nanostructures could be used to create low-reflectance glass for windows, solar cells, display devices, and military stealth technologies.

500|$|Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are {{abundant}} in living systems, {{the study of}} which {{is referred to as}} lipid polymorphism. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of <b>biomimetic</b> chemistry. In particular, biological membranes and cell membranes are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. phospholipids) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on lipid polymorphism). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip {{from one side of the}} membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by flippases and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely [...] "floating" [...] inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.|$|E

[...] At least one of theses entry inhibitors—a <b>biomimetic</b> peptide marketed under the brand name Fuzeon—has received FDA approval {{and has been in}} use for some time. [...] Potentially, one of the benefits from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 [...] wrote Soft Machines (nanotechnology and life), a {{book for}} lay audiences {{published}} by Oxford University. In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered [...] machines that {{does not take into}} account the nanoscale challenges such as wetness, stickness, Brownian motion, and high viscosity. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly <b>biomimetic</b> nanotechnology which is the way forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2014, the Navy began early {{preparation}} {{work on the}} SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034. [...] The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII Virginia is built. Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified {{is the need to}} integrate with off-board systems so future Virginia boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the Pennsylvania State University could allow a torpedo to hit a target [...] away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launched from the submarine. Researchers have identified a quieter advanced propulsion system and the ability to control multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at once as key SSN(X) components. [...] The future submarines will operate {{through the end of the}} 21st century, and potentially into the 22nd century.

2500|$|Some MOF {{materials}} may resemble enzymes {{when they}} combine isolated polynuclear sites, dynamic host-guest responses, and hydrophobic cavity environment which are characteristics of an enzyme.

In enzymatic systems, protein units show [...] "molecular recognition", high affinity for specific substrates. It seems that molecular recognition effects are limited in zeolites by the rigid zeolite structure. In contrast, dynamic features and guest-shape response make MOFs more similar to enzymes. Indeed, many hybrid frameworks contain organic parts that can rotate {{as a result of}} stimuli, such as light and heat. The porous channels in MOF structures can be used as photocatalysis sites. In photocatalysis, the use of mononuclear complexes is usually limited either because they only undergo single- electron process or from the need for high-energy irradiation. In this case, binuclear systems have a number of attractive features for the development of photocatalysts. For 0D MOF structures, polycationic nodes can act as semiconductor quantum dots which can be activated upon photostimuli with the linkers serving as photon antennae. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are semiconductors or insulators with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of conjugation in the ligands. Experimental results show that the band gap of IRMOF-type samples can be tuned by varying the functionality of the linker.|$|E
