5|$|In {{the medieval}} period, Hale Barns was an {{outlying}} {{area of the}} township of Hale, but a growth in prosperity led to it becoming a separate settlement.

Before the industrial revolution, Hale Barns was an agricultural village, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> evolved into a commuter settlement. St Ambrose College Roman Catholic boys' grammar school is in Hale Barns and the village is also home to Ringway golf club. Cotteril Clough in Hale Barns is an ancient and diverse woodland and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council. The women's variant of the game is similar to the men's version, with minor modifications to umpiring and pitch requirements. The first women's ODI was played in 1973, between England and Australia. Due to the sporting boycott placed upon their country, South Africa women did not contest their first ODI until August 1997, playing Ireland in Belfast. Later that year, South Africa entered the Women's Cricket World Cup for the first time, and were eliminated in the quarter-finals. They went one better in 2000, reaching the semi-finals, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> have finished seventh twice (2005 and 2009) and sixth (2013), before reaching the semi-finals once more in 2017. They were required to compete in a qualifying series to confirm their place in the 2009 (World Cup 2009 qualifier) and 2013 (World Cup 2013 qualifier) tournaments.|$|E
5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to the Prince of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> the Prince of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E

5|$|Mask of the Lunar Eclipse {{was first}} {{revealed}} in January 2008 at a Tecmo press conference. It {{was the first}} series title to be developed and released for a Nintendo console. It was released on July 31, 2008. Its release was timed to coincide with a traditional time in Japan for people to tell each other ghost stories. Upon release, the game featured several bugs affecting player progress through the game, as revealed in a message to fans from Nintendo. While no North American release was planned, a European release was in the works and was briefly outed by a French gaming magazine. After the leak, Nintendo stated that a European release had been planned, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> the localization had been cancelled. In addition to Nintendo, no other third-party publisher would publish the game overseas, leaving Mask of the Lunar Eclipse as a Japan-exclusive title.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of}} the gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 census gave a total {{population}} of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population {{at the time was}} mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the Yangbajain Geothermal Station. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. Tibetan Buddhism and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|The territory's {{contribution}} to the British cause during World War I had been very large in proportion to its white population, though troops had been mostly raised from scratch as {{there had been no}} professional standing army beforehand. Since the start of self-government in 1923, the colony had organised the all-white Rhodesia Regiment into a permanent defence force, complemented locally by the partly paramilitary British South Africa Police (BSAP). The Rhodesia Regiment comprised about 3,000 men, including reserves, in 1938. The country had fielded black troops during World War I, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> had retained them only within the BSAP. A nucleus of airmen existed {{in the form of the}} Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF), which in August 1939 comprised one squadron of 10 pilots and eight Hawker Hardy aircraft, based at Belvedere Airport near the capital Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers. In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period, overtaking wool exports {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
5|$|In John Gould's Handbook to the Birds of Australia, first {{published}} in 1865, he lamented {{the loss of the}} emu from Tasmania, where it had become rare and has since become extinct; he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of Sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status. In the 1930s, emu killings in Western Australia peaked at 57,000, and culls were also mounted in Queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage. In the 1960s, bounties were still being paid in Western Australia for killing emus, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then,</b> wild emus have been granted formal protection under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Their occurrence range is between , and a 1992 census suggested that their total population was between 630,000 and 725,000. As of 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers their population trend to be stable and assesses their conservation status as being of least concern. The isolated emu population of the New South Wales North Coast Bioregion and Port Stephens is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Government.|$|E

5|$|The Fiesta Bowl {{hosted the}} {{national}} championship game for the 1995 season, and thus had {{the first and second}} pick of eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The Orange Bowl had the third and fifth selections, while the Sugar Bowl had the fourth and sixth picks. The three Bowl Alliance games each were assigned a different date: December 31, January 1, or January 2. The dates rotated among the three games, along with which game would host {{the national championship}}. The Sugar Bowl was assigned the December 31 date, marking the first time it had been held on that date instead of its traditional January 1 date since December 31, 1975. From December 31, 1972, to December 31, 1975, the game was held on New Year's Eve. Thus, there were two games held during the calendar year 1972 and none in calendar year 1976. There were also two games in calendar year 1995, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then</b> the game has been held on or after January 1 following the regular season.|$|E
5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat in the northern area of the freeway was approved in 2004. The study compared the original routing for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with an alternate route that involved an indirection connection via the BL I-94 interchange and an I-94 concurrency near Benton Harbor. The study recommended using a version of the alternate connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen, both to save money and decrease impact to the Mitchell's satyr. At the time the freeway segment opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>then,</b> funding has not been available. MDOT did not include construction of the extension for this reason in the department's 2014–18 highway projects plan released in 2013, although most of the design work and land acquisition has been completed. Until the missing freeway segment is built, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange and additional lanes will be added to I-94 as well. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section. MDOT's 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016 split the remaining work into three phases. The department has listed funding for only the first two of these three phases, and construction is anticipated to start in 2021.|$|E
