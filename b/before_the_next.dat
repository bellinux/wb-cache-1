That same season Wellington Mara's mother finally allowed him to spend training camp living with the team. When he inadvertently received a black eye while he was helping the team with their punting drills, his father had to talk his mother out of making him come back home.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard and Button {{collided}} on lap18 when Button {{attempted to}} pass the Red Bull on the inside at turn eight; the Honda lost its front wing and retired a lap later after two pit stops. Hamilton continued his climb back through the field; he moved from 18th, passing Piquet, Davidson, Sutil and Bourdais in separate manoeuvres, to sit in 14th {{by the time he}} pitted on lap31. Piquet retired on lap42 with transmission failure, requiring a gearbox change <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> race.|$|E

Thrice the workers suspiciously ask Peter if he knows Jesus and thrice he denies his acquaintance. A cock crows and Peter, realizing what he has done, weeps.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2011, Stelmach {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election; he also promised a leadership race <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election. He did not specify his date of resignation at that time, however he submitted his letter of resignation in June, writing that he would leave office on October 1. In the early hours of October 2, 2011, Alison Redford was declared the new leader of the party, and Stelmach resigned as premier on October 7.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{amendment}} {{question was}} approved by voters by a tally of 836,134 votes (56.1%) to 655,333 (43.9%). In the interim period <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election in 2009, any vacancy {{in the office of}} governor after January 17, 2006 would be filled first by the senate president, followed by the speaker of the general assembly, who would vacate their legislative seat upon assuming the governor's office.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} reaches exactly 31 points, he must {{announce}} this feat to all participants <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> player shoots {{a shot in}} order to be victorious. If this is not done, the player may not again invoke his winning score until his turn comes up again in rotation. If another player in the interim successfully scores exactly 31, and properly announces it, that player wins the game.|$|E
5|$|Bond rapidly rebuilds his {{position}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> break. Le Chiffre's girlfriend, Valenka, spikes Bond's martini with poison. Bond vomits and retreats to his Aston Martin to inject himself with an antidote. MI6 instructs {{him to use}} the defibrillator, but a wire is disconnected; Vesper saves Bond by reconnecting the wire. Bond returns to the game just as Leiter loses his last hand to Le Chiffre. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand in which the remaining players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, go all in. Le Chiffre trumps the other players, but Bond wins with a straight flush.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{announced}} on 10 May 2010 {{that he would}} stand down as Labour Leader, {{with a view to}} a successor being chosen <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> mission can be taken on.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} metric system after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the metric system compulsory in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Blair {{promises}} his Chancellor, Gordon Brown {{that he will}} resign <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> general election, {{but later}} changes his mind. Brown subsequently attempts to blackmail him, threatened {{to call for a}} Labour Party inquiry into the 2005 Cash for Honours affair during an argument over pension policy. Brown succeeds Blair as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. But while Blair praises Brown as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he believes his decision to abandon the New Labour policies of the Blair years leads to the party's 2010 election defeat. However, Brown is right to restructure British banks and introduce an economic stimulus after the financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Junayd {{used the}} {{diversion}} {{to break through}} to Samarkand, but as his army exited the defile, his officers persuaded him to make camp and spend the night there instead of making for the city. The advice proved sound, as the Turgesh caught up with them and would likely have annihilated Junayd's army on open ground. As it was, the camp's fortifications could not be completed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, when the Turgesh renewed their attack. At this point, the Arabs were so hard-pressed that Junayd even promised the army's slaves their freedom if they would fight. Many did so, using saddle blankets as armour. The Turgesh attacks were repelled, and despite its heavy casualties the Umayyad army reached Samarkand after almost three days of battle.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's triumph marked {{their fifth}} European Cup {{and the first}} by an English team since Manchester United had {{defeated}} Bayern Munich in the 1999 final in Barcelona. By winning the European Cup for a fifth time, Liverpool earned the privilege of wearing a multiple-winner badge {{and the right to}} keep the trophy (under normal competition rules, the winning club can keep the trophy for only 10 months, as they must deliver it to UEFA two months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year's final). The 2005–06 participants competed for a new identical trophy. The rule to keep the trophy, which had been in effect since the 1968–69 season, was changed for the 2009–10 season, so that the actual trophy remained with UEFA at all times, thus Liverpool was the fifth and last club to accomplish the feat.|$|E
