40|$|Purpose ? The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects Web 2. 0 has on users' ability to browse online archive {{catalogues}} effectively. Design/methodology/approach ? Methods used included a review of the relevant scholarly literature, content analysis and semi?structured interviews with purposive samples of online catalogues and archive staff, respectively. Findings ? The Web 2. 0 technologies likely to improve <b>browsability</b> were identified. Web 2. 0 use was expected to be low, the results confirmed this. Results from the interviews showed that although Web 2. 0 may improve <b>browsability</b> for certain user groups, more fundamental improvements such as improved catalogue data were expected to be more effective. Interviewees did not see any clear benefits to Web 2. 0 implementation and had struggled to collect data on usage of some of the Web 2. 0 tools they used. Research limitations/implications ? The results provided confirmation of many points made in existing research. Data need to be collected from users if Web 2. 0 use and its effects on <b>browsability</b> are to be understood. At present the effects of Web 2. 0 on the <b>browsability</b> of online catalogues remains unclear. Originality/value ? This paper provides a starting point for further investigation into the effect of Web 2. 0 on the <b>browsability</b> of online catalogues. Web 2. 0 tools which could potentially improve <b>browsability</b> have been identified and a snapshot has been taken of their use across the sample cataloguesPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|One {{function}} of a call number is to organize the library collection to promote <b>browsability</b> either on the shelf or in an online catalog. This study, based on research done at the Ohio State University Libraries, examines the impact on library collection organization if call numbers are not changed {{to fit into the}} shelf list sequence. The <b>browsability</b> of items were tracked by assessing how many screens away titles appear from like items in the online public access catalog, if call numbers by a bibliographic utility were not changed. The study assesses whether not reviewing the call numbers affects patrons ‟ ability to find the items...|$|E

40|$|A {{great deal}} of systems {{software}} is available to enable researchers to utilize complex computation and data grids to perform and visualise large batches of scientific jobs [1]–[6]. However, the dependency structure for molecular hyperdynamics simulation [7]–[9] does not fall into well-studied categories. Without user interaction to steer the workflow structure, a brute force implementation could consume months of computer time. In this report, a distributed scientific filesystem is employed upon which the researcher may perform distributed computations while enabling the <b>browsability</b> required to maintain control of the virtual experiment. We demonstrate the computation time savings available through user interaction with batches of jobs running on an unreliable resource fabric, an unwieldy combination of volunteer computing sites {{as well as a}} cooperative, controlled storage network of borrowe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} Internet access has been {{characterized}} by an exponential growth. The introduction of high-speed satellite communication systems providing direct-to-home Internet services {{is a response to}} this increasing demand. However, such systems suffer from high delay-bandwidth product and high bit-error-rate which causes degradation in the performance of HTTP, which is a request-response type, application-layer protocol over TCP. In this paper we investigate HTTP/ 1. 0, HTTP/ 1. 1 and analyze different mechanisms to reduce the user-perceived delay and improve the performance of Internet delivery over satellite links. The paper also suggests other mechanisms, such as multiple parallel connections and a delta encoding implementation to overcome the above-mentioned problem. We show that there is a marked improvement in Internet <b>browsability</b> and user-perceived delay, using these methods...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{accessibility}} and usability of {{web sites}} of 60 public libraries in Catalonia, the Catalonian Library and the collective catalogue of Barcelona's libraries' network. The accessibility was evaluated using indicators {{based on the}} Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). The usability was evaluated regarding contents, users and other factors. We pay attention to URL, understandability, <b>browsability,</b> luminosity, design, etc. It concludes that 90 % of the libraries do not carry {{out some of the}} recommendations and they are inaccessible. Most of the analysed websites would need several adaptations to be accessible. The usability is also deficient in general. The librarians should get involved in the accessible design of web resources to reduce the barriers for disabled people and foster the usability of the libraries' websites for the public at large...|$|E
40|$|In {{planning}} for a new library that will include {{a limited number of}} open stacks, Grand Valley State University librarians were asked to identify what materials should be reserved for the browsable shelves. To accomplish this, librarians considered user behavior by discipline, material types, shelving options and the role of core collections. This paper will discuss these issues as well as differences in how library resources are located and the impact of new discovery tools, such as Innovative Interface 2 ̆ 7 s Encore, Bowker’s Syndetics, and Google’s Book Search on redefining <b>browsability.</b> The paper will also include a discussion of resources used in this process, such as the results from our recent LibQual study, WorldCat Collection Analysis 2 ̆ 7 Circulation Analysis and Bowker Book Analysis reports...|$|E
40|$|The model-based design {{research}} community has already produced several successful attempts {{to generate a}} target model from a source model. In this paper, we investigate to what extent a dialog model and a presentation model can be systematically derived from a task model. It is believed that these models can work better hand by hand. For this purpose, the ConcurTaskTrees notation has been exploited to provide a task model for a single-user interactive application. From the definition of operators involved in this notation, a set of systematic rules for deriving both dialog and presentation models {{at the same time}} are developed. For each operator, a decision tree presenting designers with design alternatives is proposed and based on dialog attributes (i. e., dialog control, dialog sequencing, dialog mode and function triggering mode) and dialog properties (e. g., visibility, observability, <b>browsability).</b> The refined version of the Windows Transition graphical notation is finally exploited to graphically represent the models that can be generated. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Human analysts {{working with}} {{automated}} tracing tools need to directly vet candidate traceability links {{in order to}} determine the true traceability information. Currently, human intervention happens at the end of the traceability process, after candidate traceability links have already been generated. This often leads to a decline in the results ’ accuracy. In this paper, we propose an approach, based on semantic relatedness (SR), which brings human judgment to an earlier stage of the tracing process by integrating it into the underlying retrieval mechanism. SR tries to mimic human mental model of relevance by considering a broad range of semantic relations, hence producing more semantically meaningful results. We evaluated our approach using three datasets from different application domains, and assessed the tracing results via six different performance measures concerning both result quality and <b>browsability.</b> The empirical evaluation results show that our SR approach achieves a significantly better performance in recovering true links than a standard Vector Space Model (VSM) in all datasets. Our approach also achieves a significantly better precision than Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in two of our datasets. Index Terms—information search and retrieval, automated tracing, semantic relatedness, experimentation. I...|$|E
