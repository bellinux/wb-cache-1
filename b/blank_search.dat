25|$|Dan Voiculescu, media {{owner and}} leader of the Conservative Party (PC), {{presented}} in September 2006 what he claimed were several <b>blank</b> <b>search</b> warrants issued and signed by Monica Macovei in 1984 when she was a prosecutor. PC Deputy Secretary General and former Greater Romania Party member Codrin Stefanescu made a similar claim. Blank warrants were often used during the communist period in Romania to allow prosecutors or police to conduct searches without due process.|$|E
50|$|Complaints abounded. To sceptics, his enforcers {{seemed not}} to act with {{adequate}} restraint or oversight. A Windsor, Ontario lawyer claimed that Spracklin's men, allegedly exceeding their proper duty, would arbitrarily fill in <b>blank</b> <b>search</b> warrants at will.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy {{wrote that}} The Search for Spocks major theme {{is that of}} {{friendship}}. [...] "What should a person do to help a friend? How deeply should a friendship commitment go?... And what sacrifices, what obstacles, will these people endure? That's the emotion line of the film [...] its reason for existence," [...] he recalled. While Spock's bodily resurrection was complete, his mind was a <b>blank</b> slate—The <b>Search</b> for Spock, Michele and Duncan Barrett argue, says that the important question is whether an individual's mind functions, as {{this is the key}} to a meaningful existence.|$|R
40|$|The {{resources}} {{listed below}} are works {{which do not}} bear directly to our very intense and specialized topic, but which provide a background and fill {{in some of the}} <b>blanks</b> our <b>search</b> has uncovered. These are documents that support the previous annotated references. Many of the documents listed below are further explored in a First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada publication entitled, A literature review and annotated bibliography focusing on aspects of Aboriginal child welfare in Canada, referenced in the previous section. In order to maximize time, an effort was made not to duplicate the work and simply include the most important documents relevant to our project in a separate and brief listing. Armitage, A. (1993). Family and child welfare in First Nations communities. In B. Whar...|$|R
40|$|We owe Professor Campbell {{an apology}} for our failure to quote his {{electronic}} paper on varicose veins treatment rationing; despite that, we quoted two of his papers as an incentive for us to conduct our study. Regrettably, the keywords used for our search did not retrieve the electronic publication. We tried to search for Professor Campbell’s article, after receiving his comments, using Medline and the NHS National Library for Health resources, but we hit a <b>blank</b> <b>search</b> results even by try-ing the search using both the authors and the full article title. Only when we ‘googled ’ the full title did we find the reference (a drawback of electronic publishing?). We can still claim that our survey was the first survey to paper publish rather than electronically publish, but we agree with all of Professor Campbell’s other comments. However, despite {{the similarities between the}} two articles, our article remains unique in highlighting the huge regional variations existing in the UK, which was the main aim of the article.

40|$|Vespers {{is a sound}} {{installation}} that composes {{a musical}} score in real-time, drawn from the online activity of the United Kingdom. Each day, the work begins afresh with a <b>blank</b> score, <b>searching</b> through the vast body of text and sound material posted online across the day, progressively composing a voice-led score that reflects and portrays our day-to-day concerns. Vespers is a secular evensong written for performance at dusk — a period of collective introspection on the day. Throughout the day, a number of invisible software agents search the web for new material - fragments of conversations within online communities, comments from forums, audio uploads to social media sites - mapping the nation's thoughts, ideas and concerns. Vespers references the ecclesiastical practice of evensong, a service of evening psalms {{that serves as a}} space for communal contemplation and reflection at dusk. Commissioned by the Southbank Centre and World Wide Web Foundation...|$|R
2500|$|There are {{two basic}} types of [...] "do not know" [...] decisions. First is a slow, low {{confidence}} decision. This occurs when a person has some knowledge relevant to the question asked. This knowledge is located and evaluated {{to determine whether the}} question can be answered based on what is stored in memory. In this case, the relevant knowledge is not enough to answer the question. Second, when a person has zero knowledge relevant to a question asked, he or she is able to produce a rapid response of not knowing. This occurs because the initial search for information draws a <b>blank</b> and the <b>search</b> stops, thus producing a faster response.|$|R
50|$|On 6 March 2015, police {{officers}} arrived at Li's apartment {{where she was}} living with her partner. Li initially did not {{open the door and}} overheard conversation between the officers that they had monitored her phonecalls. She eventually opened the door when the officers called a locksmith to break through the door. Li reports that the police presented her with a <b>blank</b> detention warrant, <b>searched</b> her apartment and confiscated both her and her partner's electronics. The police then took Li and her partner away in separate vehicles. Li was first taken to the local police station, where police went through her private phone calls. When requested to unlock her phone, Li took the opportunity to delete her WeChat history.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that performance in an industrial inspection task can be improved by rapidly alternating images of the item to be inspected and a perfect item onto the visual field of the inspector. Such a blink inspection system was evaluated for a complex item (a printed circuit board which could contain three flaws) and a simple item (a blank field which could contain one flaw) using eight student subjects for each of five inspection conditions. Three groups, one using blink inspection and two control groups, inspected circuit boards; two groups (one blink and one control) inspected <b>blank</b> fields. <b>Search</b> time was improved by blink inspection for the circuit boards and with different defects showing different degrees of improvement. Only one type of defect showed both reduced search times and reduced errors. For blank fields, performance was worse under blink inspection. Subjects showed a consis-tent tendency to terminate their search for defects in a logical manner, with stopping time related to search difficulty. Measures of heart rate mean and variability were taken as a pilot study to measure task stress. There was little evidence from the heart rate measures that the task was stressful...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increase}} in the number of multimedia-enabled devices (e. g. cameras, smartphones, etc.) and that has led to a vast quantity of multimedia content being shared on the Internet. For example, in 2010 thirteen million hours of video uploaded to YouTube ([URL] To usefully navigate this vast amount of information, users currently rely on search engines, social networks and dedicated multimedia websites (such as YouTube) to find relevant content. Efficient search of large collections of multimedia requires metadata that is human-meaningful, but currently multimedia sites generally utilize metadata derived from user-entered tags and descriptions. These are often vague, ambiguous or left <b>blank,</b> which makes <b>search</b> for video content unreliable or misleading. Furthermore, a large majority of videos contain people, and consequently, human movement, which is often not described in the user entered metadata...|$|R
