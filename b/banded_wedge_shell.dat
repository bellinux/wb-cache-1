Typically, two or more sympatric species of <b>wedge</b> <b>shells</b> differentially occupy intertidal, sublittoral, and offshore coastal waters in any given locality. A molecular cytogenetic analysis of two sympatric and closely related <b>wedge</b> <b>shell</b> species, Donax trunculus and Donax vittatus, was performed. Results showed that the karyotypes of these two species were both strikingly different and closely alike; whilst metacentric and submetacentric chromosome pairs were the main components of the karyotype of D. trunculus, 10 – 11 of the 19 chromosome pairs were telocentric in D. vittatus, most likely as a result of different pericentric inversions. GC-rich heterochromatic bands were present in both species. Furthermore, they showed coincidental 45 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5 S rRNA and H 3 histone gene clusters at conserved chromosomal locations, although D. trunculus had an additional 45 S rDNA cluster. Intraspecific pericentric inversions were also detected in both D. trunculus and D. vittatus. The close genetic similarity of these two species together with the high degree of conservation of the 45 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA and H 3 histone gene clusters, and GC-rich heterochromatic bands indicate that pericentric inversions contribute to the karyotype divergence in <b>wedge</b> <b>shells...</b>|$|R

50|$|It feeds by dabbling and upending, {{like its}} relatives. Its diet {{consists}} mainly of aquatic invertebrates like insects and their larvae, or crustaceans. It appears quite fond of mollusks. Small {{species such as}} pipi (Paphies australis) and large <b>wedge</b> <b>shell</b> (Macomona liliana) are eaten whole and crushed in the gizzard. For feeding on larger cockles such as Austrovenus stutchburyi (New Zealand cockle), at least some New Zealand teals have developed a peculiar technique, as of now undocumented in other birds, to force their rather soft bills between the cockle shells and tear out the flesh with a jackhammer-like pumping motion.

5000|$|Another problem Mergenthaler solved was in {{justifying}} the type, giving flush margins {{on the left}} and right.

40|$|Abstract. For {{cutting down}} {{the stress and}} {{displacement}} of <b>banded</b> <b>wedge</b> and synchronous V belt drive in the transmission process, promoting the transmission mechanism, and improving quality of the belt drive, the working principle of the transmission mechanism was introduced briefly. The three dimensional solid model of the transmission mechanism constituted in pro/e; the main parameters of the model were set using ANSYS Workbench. And then the serialization simulation analysis of the transmission mechanism was achieved when the tension force {{is located in the}} point of the V belt exiting meshing with the driven wheel; the cloud diagram of Von Mises stress and the maximal Von Mises stress and total deformation of the transmission mechanism were elicited. The simulation results were analyzed. The simulation results show that the maximal equivalent stress and maximal total deformation of the transmission mechanism are determined {{by the size of the}} tensioning force when the active force is small. Augmenting the active force of the transmission mechanism the maximal equivalent stress increases effectively and the maximal total deformation changes little when the active force is large. Reducing becomingly the tensioning force in ensuring natural belt drive shall reduce effectively the maximal Von Mises stress of the transmission mechanism. Adjusting opportunely the location of the tensioning force the total deformation of the transmission mechanism reduces effectively...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the line}} {{approaches}} its correct length, the operator is {{made aware of}} this by a bell or other indicator. If the line is ‘loose’ or too short, {{there is too much}} ‘white space’ for the space <b>band</b> <b>wedges</b> to fill out the line, and the matrices could possibly turn sidewise or fail to seal against each other as the machine prepares for the casting operation. If the line is ‘tight’ or too long, the elevator carrying the matrices and space bands will not seat properly in front of the mold slot. Both the Linotype and Intertype machines have two important safeties that act during the casting operation - the ‘pump stop’, which comes into play on loose lines, and the ‘vise automatic', which comes into play on tight lines. Both scenarios, if not stopped by these safety features, usually result in a “squirt” of molten type metal, encasing the matrices and the elevator in metal in the process. Not only is it time-consuming to clean up after a squirt, a tight line usually has not come down far enough to mate with the slots on the mold face, resulting in damage to the matrices. Therefore, it is considered very poor form for an operator (or the machinist who cared for the machine) to permit this to happen.|$|R

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope.

A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs <b>wedged</b> between the <b>shell</b> and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|R
40|$|Voids {{and cracks}} in asphalt or {{concrete}} can indicate {{the condition of}} a road or pavement. A decaying road may contain many very small cracks, and such small artifacts {{can be difficult to}} identify using conventional ground penetrating radar (GPR) techniques. A new approach is examined here to detect the scattering from the multitude of small defects in the ground. Consideration is given to the layout of suitable antennas to sensitise a GPR system to the laterally propagating cross-polarised signals that voids in a road will produce. A self-shielded antenna with a circularly symmetrical beam pattern is used to transmit vertically downwards. This is surrounded by a number of wide <b>band</b> dielectric <b>wedge</b> directional antennas, oriented to pick up the cross-polarisation of the scattered signal. The two antenna types and their groundplane configuration have reduced direct path coupling and therefore maximise system sensitivity. Tests over asphalt slabs with 7 % and 3 % changes in density and porosity show that quite significant changes in signal level make such changes in porosity detectable...|$|R

A processing map has been developed {{on the basis of}} flow stress data obtained as a function of temperature and strain rate, which revealed two domains of hot working for the alloy: one is situated at temperature between 270 ˚C and 340 ˚C with strain rate between 0. 05 s- 1 and 0. 5 s- 1, the other is situated at the temperature between 380 ˚C and 450 ˚C with strain rate between 0. 0005 s- 1 and 0. 004 s- 1.

40|$|Background This study {{examined}} the effect of operator experience, dominance, tooth position and access, on frequency and extent of iatrogenic damage to approximal tooth surfaces during conventional Class II cavity preparations, {{and the effectiveness of}} protective devices in minimising damage. Methods 10 students and 10 experienced dentists each prepared 24 Class II cavity preparations in typodont teeth without protection, 10 utilising stainless steel matrix bands and 10 utilising protective wedges. The frequency and extent of damage were analysed with respect to the above variables. Subsequently, 20 natural and 20 typodont teeth were utilised to establish the relationship in depth of damage caused by a high-speed diamond bur on typodont versus natural teeth. Results Dentists caused iatrogenic damage on 74 % of approximal surfaces without protection, which fell to 50 % and 46 % respectively when matrix <b>bands</b> and <b>wedges</b> were used as guards. The corresponding rates of damage for students were 94 %, 80 % and 44 %. There was no difference in depth of damage caused on the two types of teeth when bur was in contact with teeth for a very short time.

40|$|Background and Aims: Iatrogenic {{damage to}} {{adjacent}} tooth during proximal cavity preparation {{is one of}} the most common side effects in operative dentistry. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of iatrogenic damages to adjacent tooth during the preparation of proximal Class II cavities among undergraduate students at dental faculty of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2010.   Materials and Methods: 106 posterior permanent teeth which had Class II decay with sound proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth were selected and restored by dental students awarding the aims of the present study. After finishing restoration, proximal surfaces were completely dried by air and evaluated with dental chair light. In doubtful cases, surfaces were evaluated with × 3 magnification. Damages were classified into 2 groups; abrasion and groove. Data were analyzed using Fishers exact and Pearson chi square tests.   Results: The frequency of adjacent surfaces damage were 57. 5 %, with 31. 1 % damages as abrasion and 26. 4 % as groove. Students who used matrix <b>band</b> and <b>wedge</b> in proximal area as preventive instruments showed 53. 4 % damages and other students showed 57. 3 % damages (P> 0. 05).

40|$|We {{studied the}} drag and lift forces acting on an {{inclined}} plate {{while it is}} dragged {{on the surface of}} a granular media, both in experiment and numerical simulation. In particular, we investigated the influence of the horizontal velocity of the plate and its angle of attack. We show that a steady wedge of grains is moved in front of the plow and that the lift and drag forces are proportional to the weight of this wedge. These constants of proportionality vary with the angle of attack but not (or only weakly) on the velocity. We found a universal effective friction law which accounts for the dependence on all the above-mentioned parameters. The stress and velocity fields are calculated from the numerical simulations and show the existence of a shear <b>band</b> under the <b>wedge</b> and that the pressure is non-hydrostatic.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} optimal {{duration}} of daily wear for a laterally wedged insole with subtalar strapping {{in subjects with}} medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee (knee OA). DesignThe setting was an outpatient clinic. Eighty-one patients with knee OA were prospectively randomized according to birth date and to either 2 weeks of treatment with a lateral wedge with subtalar strapping for less than 5 h (the short group), 5 – 10 h (the medium group) or greater than 10 h (the long group) each day, or to treatment with a subtalar strapping <b>band</b> without lateral <b>wedge</b> (the placebo group). Standing radiographs were {{used to analyze the}} femorotibial angle for each subject, both with and without their respective orthotic device. The remission scores of Lequesne index were compared among the four groups at the conclusion.

40|$|Advances of {{composite}} {{systems and}} their application have revolutionised {{the management of}} posterior teeth affected by caries, facilitating a minimally invasive approach. Previous surveys have indicated that the teaching of posterior composites within dental schools was developing, albeit not keeping pace with clinical evidence {{and the development of}} increasingly predictable techniques and materials. Concurrently, surveys of dental practice indicate that dental amalgam still predominates as the 'material of choice' for the restoration of posterior teeth within UK general dental practice. In light of such considerations, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate current teaching of posterior composites in Irish and UK dental schools. An online questionnaire which sought information in relation to the current teaching of posterior composites was developed and distributed to the 17 established Irish and UK dental schools with undergraduate teaching programmes in late 2009. Results: Completed responses were received from all 17 schools (response rate = 100 %). All 17 schools taught the placement of occlusal and two-surface occlusoproximal composites in premolar and permanent molar teeth. Two schools did not teach placement of three-surface occlusoproximal composites in either premolars or molars. In their preclinical courses, ten schools taught posterior composites before teaching dental amalgams. Fifty-five percent of posterior restorations placed by dental students were of composite (range = 10 - 90 %) and 44 % amalgam (range = 10 - 90 %), indicating an increase of 180 % in the numbers of posterior composites placed over the past five years. Diversity was noted in the teaching of clinical techniques and students at different schools are trained with different composites and bonding systems. Some cause for concern was noted in the teaching of certain techniques that were not in keeping with existing best evidence, such as the teaching of transparent matrix <b>bands</b> and light-transmitting <b>wedges</b> for occluso-proximal composites (eight schools) and the teaching of bevels on the cavosurface enamel margins of both the occlusal and proximal box margins (three schools). The teaching of posterior composites in the Irish and UK dental schools has substantially increased over the last five years. Dental students in these schools often gain more experience in the placement of posterior composites than amalgam. However, practice trends indicate that a majority of GDPs continue to place amalgam in preference to composite, thereby suggesting a source of tension as current dental students emerge into the dental workforce over the coming years. There is, as a consequence, a challenge to the dental profession and its funding agencies in the UK to encourage more of a shift towards the minimally interventive use of composite systems in the restoration of posterior teeth, in particular among established practitioners...|$|R
