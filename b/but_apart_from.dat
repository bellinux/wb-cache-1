5|$|Barnes thus {{played in}} four of the five Tests, missing the fourth Test through injury. He scored 329runs, {{averaging}} 82.25. During the first-class tour matches, Barnes's performance was less spectacular. In all first-class matches on the tour, he amassed 1354runs, averaging 56.41. Barnes made 176 in 255 minutes against Surrey early in the tour, <b>but,</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> his Test hundred, his only other century came in the final tour match, when the final 50 runs of his 151 against the H. D. G. Leveson-Gower XI at the Scarborough cricket festival came in just 25 minutes.|$|E

The show's first series averaged 9.27million viewers, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> a rise in its fifth series, ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the eleventh series averaging 5.44million viewers. The twelfth series saw a small rise to 5.62million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4 million viewers per week.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} service, Nautilus and Albatross alternated between {{service with}} the High Seas Fleet; Nautilus {{participated in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in 1907 and 1908, {{and was replaced by}} Albatross thereafter. Nautilus was modernized at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel in 190910, and Albatross underwent a similar modernization there in 191011. While Albatross was out of service, Nautilus temporarily returned to the fleet. Once the former's refit was completed in 1911, the latter was transferred to mine warfare training in the North Sea before being decommissioned {{at the end of the}} year. Albatross remained in service through 1914, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> a collision with the steamer , the time passed uneventfully.|$|E

5|$|<b>But</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas {{had also}} traveled to Spain {{for his own}} purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} during the war, Hines {{was forced to}} make narrow, seemingly impossible, escapes. At one point, he concealed himself in a mattress that was being used at the time; on another occasion, he was confused for the actor and assassin John Wilkes Booth, a dangerous {{case of mistaken identity}} that forced him to flee Detroit in April 1865 by holding a ferry captain at gunpoint. Union agents viewed Hines as the man they most needed to apprehend, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the time he served at the Ohio Penitentiary in late 1863, he was never captured.|$|E
5|$|Sydneys {{failure to}} reach Fremantle on 20 November was not {{initially}} cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, {{none of which}} were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, {{with no sign of}} the cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for Sydney to break silence and report in. A raft of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November, 318 survivors from Kormorans 399 personnel were found, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> a carley float and a lifebelt, nothing from Sydney or the 645 aboard was recovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E
5|$|Casualties of the {{operation}} were not high on either side. British losses in the landing party amounted to 15 killed and 58 wounded, with an additional three missing. The naval squadron suffered no known casualties in the engagement, principally {{because they did not}} come under heavy fire. French losses have not been calculated, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> General DesBruslys were probably a similar figure to the British. In contrast, the damage to the morale of the French defenders of Île Bonaparte was severe: the death of DesBruslys and the failure to properly defend the town undermined their efforts {{to such a degree that}} the eventual invasion of the island in 1810 was carried out without significant fighting or loss. This invasion force was similar in size to the raiding party and was once again led by Rowley and Keating.|$|E
5|$|Lorraine {{was ordered}} on 15 July 1912, as a {{replacement}} for the battleship Liberté, which had been destroyed by a magazine explosion the previous year. She was laid down at the Chantiers de Penhoët shipyard in Saint-Nazaire on 1 August 1912 and launched on 30 September 1913. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 March 1916. After entering service in 1916, Lorraine and her sisters were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron. The three ships remained in the unit {{for the remainder of the}} war. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Lorraine saw no action during the conflict. In 1917, she returned to Toulon for a periodic refit, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> that voyage, she saw no time at sea for the rest of the year.|$|E

50|$|Finally, the {{recurrent}} {{pattern of}} reconnaissance not gaining recognition commensurate with its importance developed during these years. There were no “reconnaissance aces” and recon pilots were not household names. Air combat gained immense publicity, <b>but</b> - <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> reconnaissance - air operations had negligible military effect. This imbalance in perception would have consequences for preparedness in later years.|$|R

5|$|In France, Napoleon was massing {{forces to}} invade Great Britain. After a brief spell in London, where he again visited the Hamiltons, Nelson {{was placed in}} charge of {{defending}} the English Channel to prevent the invasion. He spent the summer reconnoitring the French coast, <b>but</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> a failed attack on Boulogne in August, saw little action. On 22 October 1801 the Peace of Amiens was signed between the British and the French, and Nelson – in poor health again – retired to Britain where he stayed with Sir William and Lady Hamilton. On 30 October Nelson spoke {{in support of the}} Addington government in the House of Lords, and afterwards made regular visits to attend sessions. The three embarked on a tour of England and Wales, visiting Birmingham, Warwick, Gloucester, Swansea, Monmouth and numerous other towns and villages. Nelson often found himself received as a hero and was the centre of celebrations and events held in his honour. In 1802, Nelson bought Merton Place, a country estate in Merton, Surrey (now south-west London) where he lived briefly with the Hamiltons until William's death in April 1803. The following month, war broke out again and Nelson prepared to return to sea.|$|E
