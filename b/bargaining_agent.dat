5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E

After fifteen days and two rounds of the playoffs, the referees union, the National Association of Basketball Referees, was recognized as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> for officials and playoff salaries increased from $150 a game to $750, $850, and $950 for the final three rounds of the playoffs.

For this purpose, the dynamic and equilibrium-selecting behavior of a multi-agent system consisting of adaptive <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents</b> is investigated. The agents' bargaining strategies are updated by an evolutionary algorithm (EA), an innovative computational method to simulate collective learning in societies of boundedly-rational agents. Negotiations between the agents are governed by the well-known "alternating-offers" protocol. Using this protocol, the influence of various important factors (like the finite length of the game, time preferences, exogenous breakdown, and risk aversiveness) is investigated. We show that game theory can be used successfully to interpret the equilibrium-selecting behavior observed in computational experiments with adaptive <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents.</b> Agreement between theory and experiment is especially good when the agents experience an intermediate time pressure.

Wage formation at the regional level is characterized by considerable persistence, but unemployment exerts no immediate influence on wages at the regional level. There is no evidence of a wage curve, nor of a Phillips curve, at the regional level in the Nordic countries.

We show that such flexible and powerful <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents</b> can be obtained using the combination of finite automata and evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Finite automata allow the <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents</b> to behave differently against different opponents. EAs can be used to adapt the agents' bargaining strategies (consisting of finite automata) in successive steps to generate more and more successful strategies in the course of time. The performance of the evolving automata is assessed in a competition against a broad variety of bargaining strategies. Highly-efficient bargaining strategies, which discriminate successfully between opponents with different bargaining tactics, are generated by the EA. We also investigate the situation in which the opponents are also co-evolving (and have different preferences). Positive results are obtained in this setup as well. The evolving automata perform especially well when the bargaining game is very short and a fast discrimination between different opponents becomes necessary. evolutionary algorithms, bargaining, finite automata...|$|R
