5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{operating}} systems, Plan 9 {{does not provide}} special application programming interfaces (such as Berkeley sockets, X resources or ioctl system calls) to access devices. Instead, Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file system, so that the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file input/output operations read and write. Consequently, sharing the device across the network can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio {{discussed}} the possibility of merging their three nations into a single East African Federation, agreeing that this would <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> {{the end of the}} year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based so that it can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel would have to <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E

5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, it can also <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer {{to the left and}} initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{became a}} Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its {{independence}} on 26 June 1960. As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti {{as part of}} the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both {{the quantity and quality of}} their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 39{{managers}} for the Pittsburgh Pirates franchise. The Pirates' first manager was Horace Phillips, who had coached the team before their {{move to the}} National League. In 1900, Fred Clarke began his tenure with the franchise. Clarke's 1422victories and 969losses lead all managers of the Pirates in their respective categories, Clarke also had the longest tenure as manager in his 16years in the position. Clarke managed the franchise to its first World Series victory, a feat that would also <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> Bill McKechnie, Danny Murtaugh, and Chuck Tanner. Thirteen Pirates managers have been player-managers—those who take on simultaneous roles {{as a player and}} manager. McKechnie, Connie Mack, and Ned Hanlon were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as managers. Five Pirates managers were inducted into the Hall of Fame for their performance as players. Billy Meyer's number 1, Pie Traynor's number 20, Honus Wagner's number 33, and Murtaugh's number 40 have been retired by the franchise. Hired before the 2011 season, the Pirates' current manager is Clint Hurdle.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up {{a meeting}} with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree to a common course of action in the ensuing campaign. The basis for the {{strategy}} was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703, which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull, inspired by Patkul's blueprint, advocated {{it as a way to}} lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest-Litovsk. This was to <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull's troops stationed at Brest, which would force Charles to meet them in battle. At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony, ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed. The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt's army, before Ogilvy's troops approached Charles. Otherwise Ogilvy's rear would be threatened. A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt at the same time as Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno. The belief was that there, behind fortifications, Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków. Meanwhile, von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon–Polish force towards Warsaw in order to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław I.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
