40|$|Patchouli alcohol (PA), a {{tricyclic}} sesquiterpene, {{is one of}} {{the critical}} bioactive ingredients and is mainly isolated from aerial part of Pogostemon cablin (known as guanghuoxiang in China) belonging to Labiatae. So far, PA has been widely applied in perfume industries. This review was written with the use of reliable information published between 1974 and 2016 from libraries and electronic researches including NCKI, PubMed, Reaxys, ACS, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Wiley-Blackwell, aiming at presenting comprehensive outline of security, pharmacokinetics, and bioactivities of PA and at further providing a potential guide in exploring the PA and its use in various medical fields. We found that PA maybe was a low toxic drug that was acquired numerously through vegetable oil isolation and chemical synthesis and its stability and low water dissolution were improved in pharmaceutics. It also possessed specific pharmacokinetic characteristics, such as two-compartment open model, first-order kinetic elimination, and certain <b>biometabolism</b> and biotransformation process, and was shown to have multiple biological activities, that is, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antitumor, antimicrobial, insecticidal, antiatherogenic, antiemetic, whitening, and sedative activity. However, the systematic evaluations of preparation, pharmaceutics, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and bioactivities underlying molecular mechanisms of action also required further investigation prior to practices of PA in clinic...|$|E
40|$|Background—It has {{recently}} been shown that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (mtALDH) catalyzes the formation of 1, 2 -glyceryl dinitrate and nitrite from nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate [GTN]) within mitochondria, leading to production of cGMP and vasorelaxation. However, whether this mechanism operates in the systemic and coronary beds that subserve the antianginal action of GTN is not known. In this study, we address this question in an intact canine model. Methods and Results—Fourteen healthy mongrel dogs (weight, 20 to 25 kg) were studied. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamics were continuously monitored by a pulse Doppler flow probe implanted around the left circumflex coronary artery and with catheters in left ventricle and aorta, respectively. Each dog was given a 1 -mL bolus injection of GTN, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), or adenosine through a catheter in the left atrium before and 30 minutes after infusion of cyanamide (17 mg/kg), an inhibitor of mtALDH. Cyanamide significantly inhibited both the classic dehydrogenase and GTN reductase activities of mtALDH in situ and attenuated the coronary blood flow increase and declines in blood pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure produced by GTN in vivo. In contrast, mtALDH inhibition {{had no effect on}} the coronary and systemic effects of SNP and adenosine. Conclusions—Our data suggest that mtALDH contributes to GTN biotransformation in vivo and thus at least partly underlies the antianginal mechanism of drug action. Our findings also highlight the differences in <b>biometabolism</b> o...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{therapy is}} an {{attractive}} strategy for neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy, for several reasons. Introduction of genes with a therapeutic potential can be achieved locally, by accurate injections in the compromised tissue, and release of a transgene therapeutic substance can be regulated by the surrounding host neural circuitry. The gene therapy approach circumvents any issues pertaining to drug transport across the blood-brain barrier, or <b>biometabolism</b> of drugs before reaching their target, as can happen with conventional chemical drugs when administered orally or systemically. Two strategies are available for providing gene therapy. One is direct injection of the gene vector into the targeted tissue, referred to as in vivo gene therapy; the other is introduction of cells that are previously transduced to express the gene of interest, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy. A prerequisite for successfully applying neural ex vivo gene therapy is stem cell sources of neurons, which can be transfected with the therapeutic gene, and upon injection, integrate functionally in a diseased tissue and express the gene. This thesis explores and develops experimental gene therapeutic approaches to enhance therapies in neurological disorders. Through the first three papers {{the focus is on}} stem cell therapy for Parkinson’s disease. Progressively more advanced genetic tools are applied to develop and describe stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons for use in experimental Parkinson’s disease. In Paper I, human neural stem cells are genetically immortalized, to enable unlimited expansion of the cells. However, these cells fail to reach maturity under the presented circumstances. Paper II and III introduces a protocol for successfully generating mature dopaminergic neurons from mouse neural stem cells, by genetically introducing the dopaminergic factor Wnt 5 a in the cells. The resulting dopaminergic neurons are characterized with electrophysiological tools, to gain information on their functional properties. Genetically introduced, optically controlled membrane proteins are used to investigate the integration of the dopaminergic neurons in a host tissue after transplantation. Such optogenetic probes can independently target host or transplanted cells, and with millisecond resolution activate or inhibit these, in response to optical activation with defined light-sources. Through this novel optogenetic approach, it is demonstrated that the host tissue neurons and the transplanted dopaminergic neurons can communicate, and influence the activity of each other. Paper IV applies optogenetic cell control, but utilizes it as an in vivo gene therapeutic tool, instead of as an investigative tool as above. We establish an experimental epilepsy model based on electrical stimulations, which elicit excessive, synchronized neural activity in an experimental tissue preparation. An optogenetic probe is genetically introduced to the neurons of the tissue preparation, and through optical activation of the probe, the neurons can be instantly inhibited. When optically inhibiting neurons at the onset of epileptiform activity, the duration of this activity was reduced to 20 - 50 % of the duration in control neurons. Considering that more than 30 % of epilepsy patients do not respond well to available anti-epileptic drugs, and that these drugs commonly has adverse cognitive side effects, the suggested role of optogenetic cell control in epilepsy holds great promises, though this research is still at an early stage. This thesis provides new knowledge on experimental research and therapy approaches, which will contribute to understand and develop stem cell and gene therapies for neurological disorders...|$|E

Applicability of laccases has been highlighted due to green nature and versatile biochemical {{features of the}} enzymes. In particular, use of fungal laccases that are commercially available {{has proven to be}} effective for several biotechnological areas including pulp or textile bleaching, bioremediation, organic synthesis, and polymer surface modification. The green nature of the laccase applications can be markedly enhanced by the use of low-molecular-weight naturally occurring phenols, whose involvements in laccase-catalyzed in vivo metabolisms contributing carbon recycling in land ecosystem and morphogenesis of bio-matrices are also evident. Although several review papers focusing on laccase biotechnological applicability have been reported, connection between the in vivo metabolisms and the application concepts has not been attracted. Thus, we here reviewed current advances in laccase-catalyzed oxidations of naturally occurring phenols particularly focusing on laccase-mediator system (LMS) and organic synthesis, and discussed how both the application strategies can mimic in vivo <b>biometabolism</b> to make the application processes much greener and to extend applicability of the green reactions. 	Laccases have low redox potentials limiting their environmental and industrial applications. The use of laccase mediators has proven to be an effective approach for overcoming the low redox potentials. However, knowledge about the role played by the mediator cocktails in such a laccase-mediator system (LMS) is scarce. Here we assembled different dual-agent mediator cocktails containing 2, 2 ′-azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonate (ABTS), vanillin, and/or acetovanillone, and compared their mediating capabilities with those of each individual mediator alone in oxidation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by Ganoderma lucidum laccase. Cocktails containing ABTS and either vanillin or acetovanillone strongly promoted PCP removal compared to the use of each mediator alone. The removal enhancement was correlated with mediator molar ratios of the cocktails and incubation times. Analysis of the kinetic constants for each mediator compound showed that G. lucidum laccase was very prone to react with ABTS rather than vanillin and acetovanillone in the cocktails. Moreover, the presence of the ABTS radical (ABTS+&# 8226) and vanillin or acetovanillone significantly enhanced PCP removal concomitant with electron transfer from vanillin or acetovanillone to ABTS+&# 8226. These results strongly suggest that vanillin and acetovanillone mediate the reaction between ABTS and PCP via multiple sequential electron transfers among laccase and its mediators. Laccase efficiently catalyzes polymerization of phenolic compounds. However, knowledge on applications of polymers synthesized in this manner remains scarce. Here, the potential of laccase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols to form products useful in hair dyeing was investigated. All 15 tested phenols yielded colored products after laccase treatment and color diversity was attained by using mixtures of two phenolic monomers. After exploring color differentiation pattern of 120 different reactions with statistical regression analysis, three monomer combinations, namely gallic acid and syringic acid, catechin and catechol, and ferulic acid and syringic acid, giving rise to brown, black, and red materials, respectively, were further characterized because such colors are commercially important for gray hair dyeing. Selected polymers could strongly absorb visible light and their hydrodynamic sizes ranged from 100 to 400 nm. Analyses of enzyme kinetic constants, liquid chromatography, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) coupled with collision-induced dissociation MS/MS indicate that both monomers in reactions involving catechin and catechol, and ferulic acid and syringic acid, are colored by heteropolymer synthesis, but the gallic acid/syringic acid combination is based on homopolymer mixture formation. Comparison of color parameters from these three reactions with those of corresponding artificial homopolymer mixtures also supported the idea that laccase may catalyze either hetero- or homo-polymer synthesis. We finally used selected materials to dye gray hair. Each material colored hair appropriately and the dyeing showed excellent resistance to conventional shampooing. Our study indicates that laccase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols is applicable to the development of new cosmetic pigments. Fungal laccase-based eco-coloration with plant-derived phenols is highly applicable to cosmetic or food processing industries due to eco-friendly features of the dye synthesis process. However, the synthesis procedure is not based on any theoretical rationale so that considerable experimental work is required for finding desirable colors. Here, the coloration reaction using natural phenol blends was numerically predicted using a well-defined learning algorithm, the support vector machine. Both forward and backward predictions were successfully developed using 1, 439 different colorations for training and testing. The forward calculations commenced with known monomer compositions and yielded color parametersthe mean absolute errors for each parameter were 1. 4222 for L*, 0. 7583 for a*, and 2. 1442 for b*. Reversely, the backward calculations with known color parameters yielded monomer compositionsaverage accuracy was 71. 9 %. Two variables regarding color differentiation of each natural phenol were identified to critically affect the backward prediction accuracy, suggesting dependence of the accuracy on monomer compositions and color differentiation capacity of each monomer. Based on true or false (either -positive or -negative) ratio analysis, relation between the accuracy and the monomer composition was further discussed. Our coloration data pool and predictive models will aid to develop synthetic routes to give rise to desirable colors via fungal laccase-catalyzed polymerization of plant-derived phenols. The color SVM software is available at [URL] Natural organic coagulants (NOCs) such as chitosan and Moringa oleifera seeds have been extensively characterized for potential application in water treatment as an alternative to metal-based coagulants. However, the action of both chitosan and Moringa oleifera seeds is mainly restricted to anionic organic pollutants because of their cationic functional groups affording poor cationic pollutant coagulation by electrostatic repulsion. In this study, we employed ethanolic grape seed extract (GSE) and grape seed-derived polyphenols such as tannic acid and catechin in an effort to find novel NOCs showing stable anionic forms for removal of cationic organic pollutants. The target substances tested were malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV), both mutagenic cationic dyes. Polyphenol treatment induced fast decolorization followed by gradual floc formation concomitant with red or blue shifts in maximum absorbance wavelengths of the cationic dyes. Liquid chromatography analysis of flocs formed by polyphenols directly showed that initial supramolecular complexes attributed mainly to electrostatic attraction between polyphenol hydroxyphenyl groups and cationic dyes further progressed into stronger aggregates, leading to precipitation of dye-polyphenol complexes. Consistent with the results obtained using catechin and tannic acid, use of GSE also resulted in effective decolorization and coagulation of soluble MG and CV in aqueous solutions. Screening of several organic GSE components for NOC activity strongly suggested that natural polyphenols are the main organic ingredients causing MG and CV removal via gradual floc formation. The treatment by natural polyphenols and GSE decreased toxicity of MG- or CV-contaminated water...|$|E
