5|$|To {{combat the}} {{perceived}} threat of brucellosis transmission to cattle, national park personnel regularly harass <b>bison</b> herds {{back into the}} park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996–97, the <b>bison</b> herd was so large that 1,079 <b>bison</b> that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. Animal rights activists argue {{that this is a}} cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the <b>bison</b> are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the <b>bison</b> and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.|$|E

5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European <b>bison</b> is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe <b>bison.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PL <b>Bisons</b> were {{an outlaw}} {{franchise}} that played concurrently with the minor league Buffalo <b>Bisons</b> and apparently used the stock <b>Bisons</b> name without {{the permission of}} the legitimate team; the legitimate <b>Bisons</b> played at Buffalo Baseball Park across town. The current <b>Bisons</b> franchise does not recognize the PL <b>Bisons</b> as part of their history.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Bisons</b> {{have existed}} {{in some form}} since 1877, {{most of that time}} playing in {{professional}} baseball's second tier; exceptions have included the 1879-85 <b>Bisons,</b> who played in the major leagues {{as a member of the}} National League, and the 1979-84 <b>Bisons,</b> who played at the third-tier Double-A level.

5|$|Since the 19th century, {{humans have}} {{impacted}} Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, {{and development in}} the Bow Valley, among other human activities. <b>Bison</b> once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last <b>bison</b> were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains <b>Bison</b> were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.|$|E
50|$|The Buffalo <b>Bisons</b> were a Major League Baseball {{franchise}} {{based in}} Buffalo, New York. The team existed for one season, , and {{played in the}} Players' League.

5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting <b>bison,</b> which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the <b>bison</b> were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some {{of the rest of the}} party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E

5|$|Aang's {{character}} was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, depicting a bald {{man with an}} arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into {{a picture of a}} child with a flying <b>bison.</b> Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E
5|$|An apex predator, Smilodon {{primarily}} hunted large mammals. Isotopes {{preserved in}} the bones of S.fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like <b>bison</b> (<b>Bison</b> antiquus, which was {{much larger than the}} modern American <b>bison)</b> and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes {{preserved in the}} tooth enamel of S.gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; <b>bison</b> were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species {{may be due to the}} difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a scavenger that mainly used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{found at}} Vermilion Lakes indicates {{the first human}} activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P.

5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe <b>bison</b> (<b>Bison</b> priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that American <b>Bison</b> began a {{periodic}} east–west trek through Indiana, crossing the Falls of the Ohio and the Wabash River near modern-day Vincennes.
