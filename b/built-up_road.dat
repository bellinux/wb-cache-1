A priori defined five land cover classes in classification scheme were built-up, vegetated area, bare areas, water bodies and roads.

50|$|For {{road traffic}} safety {{purposes}} {{it can be}} helpful to classify roads into three usages: built-up urban streets with slower speeds, greater densities, and more diversity among <b>road</b> users; non <b>built-up</b> rural <b>roads</b> with higher speeds; and major highways (motorways/ Interstates/ freeways/ Autobahns, etc.) reserved for motor-vehicles, and which are often designed to minimize and attenuate crashes. Most injuries occur on urban streets but most fatalities on rural roads, while motorways are the safest in relation to distance traveled. For example, in 2013, German autobahns carried 31% of motorized road traffic (in travel-kilometres) while accounting for 13% of Germany's traffic deaths. The autobahn fatality rate of 1.9 deaths per billion-travel-kilometres compared favorably with the 4.7 rate on urban streets and 6.6 rate on rural roads.|$|R

A distinction is made, according to the road maintenance authority: national roads; provincial roads; the remaining <b>roads</b> outside <b>built-up</b> areas; and <b>roads</b> inside <b>built-up</b> areas. In addition, the traffic risk development is given for the various road types: motorways; secondary roads; roads closed to slow traffic; roads for all traffic outside <b>built-up</b> areas; and <b>road</b> types inside <b>built-up</b> areas, namely: arterial roads, residential streets, and the `woonerf' streets.

Possible explanations for the noted risk variations are sought partly in the relationship between the number of accidents and the average daily motor vehicle intensities per road type. These intensities are derived from the statistics concerning road lengths and vehicle kilometres. The results of the study support the supposition that a sudden traffic growth change has an unfavourable effect on the accident risk...|$|R

Land surface radiance temperature (SRT) values were extracted from a Landsat TM image by 2001. <b>Built-up</b> area and <b>road</b> system were got from 1 : 10, 000 scale topographic maps.

It is found that dry river bed area across city was hottest, but multiple heat islands emerged over several satellite cities within the metropolis. The statistical analysis indicates that the UHI intensities had a negative relationship with NDVI, but positively correlated with built-up ratio, non-agricultural population density and road density. Interestingly, the stepwise regression analysis indicates that population density did not show any meaningful statistical relationship with the UHI intensity. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Image {{segmentation}} {{plays an}} important role in human vision, computer vision, and pattern recognition fields. Segmentation based on texture can improve the accuracy of interpretation. Satellite images are used in order to detect the distribution of classes such as soil, vegetation, <b>built-up</b> areas, <b>roads,</b> rivers, lakes etc. A problem that arises when segmenting an image is that the number of feature variables or dimensionality is often quite large. In this paper we used random field theory for identification of those classes and used multi resolution Haar wavelet transformation to put each pixel in desired class with great probability. Experiments are conducted on a set of 30 natural satellite texture images. A specific attention is paid to the use of Haar transform as a tool for image compression and image pixels feature extraction. Proposed algorithm is verified for simulated images and applied for a selected satellite image processing in the MATLAB environment.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} capability of the multitemporal RADARSAT Fine-Beam C-HH SAR imagery for extracting landuse/land-cover information in the rural-urban fringe of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) using various image processing techniques and classification algorithms. Five-date RADARSAT fine-beam SAR images were acquired during May to August in 2002. The major landuse/land-cover classes were high-density built-up areas, low-density <b>built-up</b> areas, <b>roads,</b> forests, parks, golf courses, water and three types of agricultural lands. These ten classes were chosen to characterize the complex landuse/land-cover types in the rural-urban fringe of the GTA. The results demonstrated that, for identifying landuse/land-cover classes, five-date raw SAR imagery yielded very poor result due to speckles. The best result was achieved for combined Mean, Standard Deviation and Correlation texture images using artificial neural networks (ANN) (overall accuracy: 89. 7 % and Kappa: 0. 886).

Fivedate RADARSAT fine-beam SAR images over the rural-urban fringe of the Greater Toronto Area were acquired during May to August in 2002. One scene of Landsat TM imagery was acquired in 1988 for change detection. The major landuse/land-cover classes were high-density built-up areas, low-density <b>built-up</b> areas, <b>roads,</b> forests, parks, golf courses, water and four types of agricultural crops (soybeans, corn, winter wheat/rye and pasture). The proposed approach to classify SAR images consisted of three steps: 1) image segmentation, 2) feature selection and object-based neural network classification, 3) rule set development to improve classification accuracy. Post-classification change detections were then performed using the final classification result of RADARSAT SAR images and the classification result of Landsat TM imagery. The results showed that the proposed approach achieved very good classification accuracy (overall: 87. 9 %; kappa: 0. 867). The change detection procedure was able to identify the areas of significant changes, for example, new built-up areas, even though the overall accuracy of the change detection was not high. 1...|$|R
