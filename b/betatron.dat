5|$|Donald William Kerst (November 1, 1911 – August 19, 1993) was an American {{physicist}} {{who worked}} on advanced particle accelerator concepts (accelerator physics) and plasma physics. He is most notable for his development of the <b>betatron,</b> a novel type of particle accelerator used to accelerate electrons.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial <b>betatron</b> reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the <b>betatron.</b> When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1945 {{he became}} Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a {{position}} he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school {{at a time when}} Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and most research students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947–48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV <b>betatron</b> was converted an 18 MeV electron synchrotron in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to scrounge funding and components from various sources. Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

In 1948, the university built the first <b>betatron</b> facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female Chancellor of the University, Sylvia Fedoruk, {{was a member of the}} cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's Lieutenant-Governor from 1988–1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is the size of a football field. The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus. The University used the SCR-270 radar in 1949 to image the Aurora for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} those nuclear {{reactions}} which {{occur as a}} result of x-ray irradiation has been greatly facilitated by the increasing availability of high energy <b>betatrons</b> and synchrotrons. On occasion radioactivity may be induced in irradiated nuclei and in these cases it is possible to conclude that either a new element or an isotope of the bombarded nucleus has been formed. Since the nature of the radiation from many unstable nuclei is well known, a study of the type and energy of the emitted particles and the period of radioactive decay will usually suffice to determine which nucleus has been formed. In all cases the new nucleus is found to be the old nucleus with one or more neutrons and/or protons removed.

30|$|The several NDE {{techniques}} available {{are being}} discussed here in brief. Radiographic inspection (X-ray and gamma-ray) involves penetration of gamma- or X-ray radiation on {{materials and products}} to detect defects or examine internal or hidden features. In acoustic emission testing, a localized external {{force is applied to}} the part being tested. The resulting stress waves in turn generate short-lived, high-frequency elastic waves that are detected by sensors that have been attached to the part surface. Ultrasonic inspection uses the same principle as is used in naval SONAR and fish finders. Ultra-high-frequency sound is introduced into the part being inspected and by measuring the returning time of reflected wave, the distance to the reflector (the indication with the different acoustic impedance) can be determined. Neutron radiography uses an intense beam of low-energy neutrons as a penetrating medium. Neutrons generated by linear accelerators, <b>betatrons</b> or other sources penetrate most metallic materials, rendering them transparent, but are attenuated by most organic materials (including water, due to its high hydrogen content) which allows those materials to be seen within the component being inspected. Magnetic particle testing (MT) uses one or more magnetic fields to locate surface and near-surface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials. This produces a visible indication of defect {{on the surface of the}} material.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a trend toward high-energy accelerators as sources of X-rays and {{electrons}} for radiotherapy. Commercial electron linacs are available up to 35 MeV and <b>betatrons</b> up to 45 MeV. For most elements the photoneutron threshold is in the 6 - 18 MeV energy range so there is an inevitable production of neutrons. The neutrons are relatively unattenuated by the photon collimation and shielding, so they constitute a component of leakage radiation which contributes to the whole-body dose of the patient {{as well as to the}} treat-ment dose. Concern about the effect of the neutron component has been reflected in present and proposed regulations. 1 In measuring the neutron dose, the experimenter has the problem of detecting neutrons in the presence of a high-energy photon field. It is the purpose of this paper to study the photon response of one type of neutron detector. A broad class of fast-neutron detectors consists of a hydrogenous moderator to thermalize the fast neutrons and a thermal neutron detector inside of it.

40|$|Megavoltage {{electron}} beams {{represent an}} important treatment modality in modern radiotherapy, often providing a unique {{option in the}} treatment of superficial tumours (less than 5 cm deep). Electrons have been used in radiotherapy since the early 1950 s, first produced by <b>betatrons</b> and then by microtrons and linacs. Modern high energy linacs typically provide, in addition to two megavoltage photon energies, several electron beam energies in the range from 4 to 22 MeV. 8. 1. 1. General shape of the depth dose curve The general shape of the central axis depth dose curve for electron beams differs from that of photon beams (see Fig. 8. 1). Figure 8. 1 (a) shows depth doses for various electron beam energies and Fig. 8. 1 (b) shows depth doses for 6 and 15 MV X ray beams. Typically, the electron beam central axis depth dose curve exhibits a high surface dose (compared with megavoltage photon beams), and the dose then builds up to a maximum at a certain depth referred to as the electron beam depth of dose maximum z max. Beyond z max the dose drops off rapidly and levels off at a small low level dose component referred to as the bremsstrahlung tail.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that charged particles cannot be accelerated from ground potential to ground potential unless {{they pass through}} a system which has associated iwth it a time varying magnetic field. D. C. electric fields must satisfy the equation {contour_integral} Eds = 0, while the time varying fields used in radio-frequency accelerators and <b>betatrons</b> are freed from this restriction of scalar potential theory. In 1932, AJ Dempster produced protons with an energy of 45 Kev, by passing them from an electrode at + 22. 5 kv dc to ground. The protons were first accelerated to ground potential, with an energy gain of 22. 5 kev. A {{small fraction of the}} protons then picked up an electron from a residual gas molecule, and ''coasted'' to a second electrode at + 22. 5 kv. Then a small fraction of these neutral hydrogen atoms lost their electrons, and were accelerated to ground with a second gain in energy equal to 22. 5 kev. An accelerator of this type is obviously impractical for several reasons. The probability of neutralizing a proton varies inversely with a high power of the particle velocity, so the scheme would not work at energies of interest to nuclear physicists. Even at the low energies where neutralization is not negligible, the energy spread of the beam would be wide because charge exchange could take place at all points along the beam trajectory...|$|R
