25|$|<b>Behavioral</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{difficult}} to study in animal models because {{it is difficult to}} know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a monkey effectively communicate that he is sad or that he feels overwhelmed? Lacking the ability to use language to study <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders</b> like depression and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted. It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals.|$|E

We would like to uncover how the surrounding adaptation {{is affected by the}} <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder.</b> In the theoretical part there are facts concerning the <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> focused on the ADHD/ADD syndrome issue. The process of socialization described in all stages and the family as a remarkable factor of generating the basic social values and approaches is below. The empiric part is focused on research completion among former students of the Primary School for Children with <b>Behavioral</b> <b>Disorder.</b> It is concerned in student' success in further training at secondary schools. The process of question-forms with statements completed by former students' parents follows. These are applied either to confirm or refute the defined hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> {{is characterized by}} the absence of muscular atonia during REM sleep. In this disorder, patients can violently act out their dreams, placing them at risk for traumatic fractures during these episodes. REM sleep <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> (RBD) can be a sign of future neurodegenerative disease and has also been found to be a side effect of certain psychiatric medications. We present a case of venlafaxine-induced RBD in a 55  year old female who presented with a 13  year history of intermittent parasomnia and dream enactment in addition to a recent history of two fractures requiring intervention...|$|R
50|$|An internalizing {{disorder}} is {{one type of}} emotional and <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder,</b> along with externalizing disorders, and low incidence disorders. One who suffers from an internalizing disorder will keep their problems to themselves, or internalize the problems.|$|R
25|$|Psychiatry is {{the branch}} of {{medicine}} concerned with the bio-psycho-social study of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cognitive, perceptual, emotional and <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders.</b> Related non-medical fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} {{arrive at}} an emergency department for a complaint of mental illness. In many jurisdictions (including many US states), patients who appear to be mentally ill and to present a danger to themselves or others may be brought against their will to an emergency department by law enforcement officers for psychiatric examination. The emergency department conducts medical clearance rather than treats acute <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders.</b> From the emergency department, patients with significant mental illness may be transferred to a psychiatric unit (in many cases involuntarily).|$|E
25|$|While {{music therapy}} {{has been used}} for many years, up until the mid-1980s little {{empirical}} research had been done to support the efficacy of the treatment. Since then, more research has focused on determining both the effectiveness and the underlying physiological mechanisms leading to symptom improvement. For example, one meta-study covering 177 patients (over 9 studies) showed a significant effect on many negative symptoms of psychopathologies, particularly in developmental and <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders.</b> Music therapy was especially effective in improving focus and attention, and in decreasing negative symptoms like anxiety and isolation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} patient that {{developed}} severe belching during pregnancy. Esophageal pH-impedance monitoring revealed frequent supragastric belching, but not gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thus, severe belching during pregnancy can {{be due to}} a <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> in the absence of GERD. Belching complaints during pregnancy should therefore not always be treated as GER...|$|R

25|$|The {{physical}} {{aspects of}} the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of neurology, the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders.</b> Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of phenomenological or information processing theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience.|$|E
25|$|However, recent animal {{research}} has shown a correlation between paternal alcohol exposure and decreased offspring birth weight. Behavioral and cognitive disorders, including difficulties with learning and memory, hyperactivity, and lowered stress tolerance {{have been linked to}} paternal alcohol ingestion. The compromised stress management skills of animals whose male parent was exposed to alcohol are similar to the exaggerated responses to stress that children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome display because of maternal alcohol use. These birth defects and <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders</b> were found in cases of both long- and short-term paternal alcohol ingestion. In the same animal study, paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects (VSD) at birth. VSD has also been correlated with paternal alcohol abuse in humans.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by director Mark Kirkland {{and was the first}} episode staff writer George Meyer received a sole writing credit for since the season 5 episode [...] "Bart's Inner Child". Meyer, who was facing some psychological difficulties while writing the episode, felt so dissatisfied with the episode's first draft that he turned it in with a pseudonym. The episode satirizes the perceived misdiagnosis of <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders</b> in children, which was a controversial topic at the time the episode was written. The episode's title is a parody of The Rolling Stones song [...] "Mother's Little Helper", which was also written on the topic of psychological medication.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a persistent <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> associated with bilateral {{destruction of the}} head of the caudate nuclei.

50|$|Extremes {{analysis}} {{examines the}} link between normal and pathological traits. For example, it is hypothesized that a given <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> may represent an extreme of a continuous distribution of a normal behavior and hence an extreme of a continuous distribution of genetic and environmental variation. Depression, phobias, and reading disabilities have been examined in this context.|$|R

500|$|According to Genevieve Koski, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Sean O'Neal, Kyle Ryan, and Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club, the '90s saw a [...] "dramatic increase" [...] in {{diagnoses of}} <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as ADHD, in {{children}}, and debates {{over whether or}} not to medicate children with concentration difficulties were heated. Meyer, inspired by the debates, decided to write the episode to be about the subject. The episode criticizes how children with school issues are being misdiagnosed as having ADHD, as well as the prescription of psychostimulants to children in general. This in particular is shown in a scene in the Springfield Elementary schoolyard. In the scene, it is revealed that the general populace of the school is medicated for various misdiagnosed behavior disorders. Meyer himself was not entirely sure about his stance on the issue, however. He stated that [...] "for all I know, the drugs help [...] and help the world." [...] However, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "I just have a feeling they're gonna be a disaster. Down the line." ...|$|E

2500|$|Atypical {{antipsychotic}} medications, {{which are}} approved {{for the treatment}} of certain <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders,</b> are sometimes prescribed off-label as a combination therapy with stimulants {{for the treatment of}} comorbid (i.e., co-occurring diseases) ADHD and disruptive <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders.</b> Canadian clinical practice guidelines only support the use of dopaminergic antipsychotics with selectivity for D2-type dopamine receptors, particularly risperidone, as a third-line treatment for both disorders following the failure of stimulant monotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Combined use of D2-type receptor antagonists and ADHD stimulants for the treatment of ADHD with comorbid <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders</b> {{does not appear to have}} significantly worse adverse effects than ADHD stimulant or antipsychotic monotherapy. Research suggests, but has not yet confirmed, the treatment efficacy of [...] antipsychotic and stimulant combination treatment for both disorders; it is unclear if the combination therapy for both disorders is superior to stimulant or antipsychotic monotherapy. There is no evidence to support the use of any subclass of antipsychotics for the treatment of the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e., inattention and hyperactivity) without comorbid <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E
40|$|ADHD is {{a common}} neurodevelopmental and <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> {{affecting}} approximately 5 % to 10 % of school-age children (Scahill & Schwab-Stone, 2000).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze how parent-child interactions differ in discourse structure, communicative function and linguistic behaviors between children who are at high-risk for developing a <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> such as ADHD, and those who are at high-risk for developing a <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> with a co-occurring language impairment. Participants consisted of 20 children ages three to five years old and their parents. A five-minute parent-child interaction was video recorded and analyzed using an adapted version of the “Coding parent/child interaction as a clinical outcome: a research note” designed by Law, Barnett, and Kot (1999). Results revealed slight differences in each communication parameter amongst the two groups, however, statistical results of parametric and non-parametric tests determined that there were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups, with the exception of increased verbal initiations (p=. 040) in children with no language impairment when compared to those with a language impairment as was expected...|$|R
40|$|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is a <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> {{that affects}} up to 1 in 20 {{children in the}} USA. The predominance of American research into this disorder over the past 40 years {{has led to the}} impression that ADHD is largely an American disorder and is much less prevalent elsewhere. This impression was reinforced by the perception that ADHD may stem from social and cultural factors that are most common in American society. However, another school of thought suggested that ADHD is a <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> common to children of many different races and societies worldwide, but that is not recognized by the medical community, perhaps due to confusion regarding its diagnosis and/or misconceptions regarding its adverse impact on children, their families, and society as a whole. In this article we present the available data, with a view to determining the worldwide prevalence of ADHD. A total of 50 studies were identified from a MEDLINE search for the terms ADHD, ADD, HKD, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and prevalence combined, for the years 1982 to 2001. 20 were studies in US populations and 30 were in non-US populations. Analysis of these studies suggests that the prevalence of ADHD is at least as high in many non-US children as in US children, with the highest prevalence rates being seen when using DSM-IV diagnoses. Recognition that ADHD is not purely an American disorder and that the prevalence of this <b>behavioral</b> <b>disorder</b> in many countries is in the same range as that in the USA will have important implications for the psychiatric care of children...|$|R
