As a result, Jefferson County established a poor house system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed {{as one of the}} first superintendents of the poor house located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York. People sent to the poor house would have a place to live and would be provided with food and rudimentary medical care in exchange for some work, usually tied in with farming, e.g., picking oakum.|$|E

25|$|The stormy sea created <b>big</b> <b>problems</b> for the torpedo boats {{when their}} {{propellers}} were lifted {{too close to}} the surface. This reduced their efficiency and what worsened the situation {{was the fact that the}} S2s bearings were worn out, which caused a lot of vibrations in the ship and threatened to open up a leak where the shaft went through the hull. Both of the torpedo boats began taking in water in the high seas. This was mainly due to the construction of the superstructure. The coal was also slowly running out since the crew had to feed more into the boilers than usual due to the high seas. The flotilla leader Klas Horn sent out a distress call on behalf of the torpedo boats. The rescue ship Protector, which was located in Vaasa, received the distress call through the Finnish headquarters in Helsinki, and the message was also received by the Swedish rescue vessel Helios. Both promised that they would come to the rescue.|$|E

500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and {{that many of our}} <b>big</b> <b>problems</b> and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

500|$|International Training Week for luge {{took place}} at the track 7–15 November 2008. A total of 2482 runs took place during the {{training}} with several injuries occurring, most notably Loch, the 2008 men's singles world champion, who injured his shoulder. In a 9 December 2008 press release, the Centre was continuing certification by adding protections on the track against crashes and weather. FIL President Josef Fendt stated that the track's speed was too high with top speeds reaching [...] during training. From the 2482 runs executed during the International Training week for luge, there were 73 crashes, a crash rate of three percent which was normal during new track testing. Three lugers, including Loch, were sent to the hospital, but were later released. Italy's Zöggeler stated that [...] "The track can be tackled." [...] and [...] "does not see <b>big</b> <b>problems</b> for the athletes" [...] while Fendt called for the top track speed for future tracks to be lowered to [...] where possible. For the 2008–09 World Cup season at the Centre, 15115 runs were made for bobsleigh (2153), luge (9672), and skeleton (3290). After the World Cup event on 20–21 February 2009, Austria's Andreas Linger described the track as [...] "fast, incredibly fast." ...|$|E

[...] These {{included}} halfback Eddie Usher, who played for the Green Bay Packers in 1922, and fullback Frank Steketee, {{who had been a}} first-team All-American as a freshman in 1918. Despite the loss of Usher and Steketee, the 1922 backfield was promising with Irwin Uteritz, Harry Kipke, Franklin Cappon, and Doug Roby all returning from the 1921 team. [...] Michigan's biggest weakness going into the 1922 season was the center of its line. [...] All-American center Ernie Vick graduated and joined the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team in June 1922.

2500|$|Ming-Ming Duckling (voiced by Danica Lee in the U.S.) is an overconfident young {{duck and}} the {{youngest}} of the three. As a superhero, she wears a leather pilot's helmet with goggles and a green cape. Unlike the other Wonder Pets, she can fly. She can also speak [...] "bird", allowing her to talk to other birds that the Wonder Pets encounter. Ming-Ming also believes that her great-grandfather was an eagle. Ming-Ming sometimes tries to take on <b>big</b> <b>problems</b> by herself and in one episode ("Save the Duckling") she even becomes the animal that needed rescuing. Ming-Ming often provides comic relief in the show, and is the Wonder Pet mostly likely to use irony and mild sarcasm. In [...] "Kalamazoo!", during school holiday she visits her Aunt Eleanora at a local petting zoo. Ming-Ming is voiced by Danica Lee in the United States version. When Lee auditioned for the role, she changes the words from [...] "R" [...] to [...] "W" [...] sounds like a child would speak (as in [...] "This is Se-wious!"). The producers said that Lee's speech impediment had an endearing quality and that young children commonly mispronounce certain sounds. Danica Lee has been nominated twice, in 2007 and 2008, for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program.|$|E
2500|$|While Clinton's {{tenure as}} Secretary of State was popular {{at the time}} among the public and praised by President Obama, {{observers}} have noted {{that there was no}} signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of Dean Acheson, George Marshall, or Henry Kissinger. The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left. Many of Clinton's initiatives in the [...] "smart power" [...] realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect. Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that [...] "She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy." [...] Michael E. O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution analyst, said that, [...] "Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few <b>big</b> <b>problems</b> were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [...] more solid than spectacular." [...] Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled , former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney argue that Clinton's tenure, and the Obama administration's foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since World War II. Others, however, such as Eric Schmidt disagree, and have argued that Clinton was [...] "perhaps the most significant secretary of state since" [...] Acheson. All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, [...] "She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{our problem}} has been selected, and the {{necessary}} mental discipline has been acquired, the method to be pursued is fairly uniform. The <b>big</b> <b>problems</b> which provoke philosophical inquiry are found, on examination, to be complex, and to depend upon a number of component problems, usually more abstract than those {{of which they are}} the components. It will generally be found that all our initial data, all the facts that we seem to know to begin with, suffer from vagueness, confusion, and complexity. Current philosophical ideas share these defects; it is therefore necessary to create an apparatus of precise conceptions as general and as free from complexity as possible, before the data can be analysed into the kind of premisses which philosophy aims at discovering. In this process of analysis, the source of difficulty is tracked further and further back, growing at each stage more abstract, more refined, more difficult to apprehend. Usually it will be found that a number of these extraordinarily abstract questions underlie any one of the big obvious problems. When everything has been done that can be done by method, a stage is reached where only direct philosophic vision can carry matters further. Here only genius will avail. What is wanted, as a rule, is some new effort of logical imagination, some glimpse of a possibility never conceived before, and then the direct perception that this possibility is realised in the case in question. Failure to think of the right possibility leaves insoluble difficulties, balanced arguments pro and con, utter bewilderment and despair. But the right possibility, as a rule, when once conceived, justifies itself swiftly by its astonishing power of absorbing apparently conflicting facts. From this point onward, the work of the philosopher is synthetic and comparatively easy; it is in the very last stage of the analysis that the real difficulty consists.|$|E
