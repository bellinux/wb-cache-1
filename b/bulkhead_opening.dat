40|$|The suitport {{concept has}} been {{recently}} implemented {{as part of}} the small pressurized lunar rover (Currently the Space Exploration vehicle, or SEV) and the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) concept demonstrator vehicle. Suitport replaces or augments the traditional airlock function of a spacecraft by providing a <b>bulkhead</b> <b>opening,</b> capture mechanism, and sealing system to allow ingress and egress of a space suit while the space suit remains outside of the pressurized volume of the spacecraft. This presents significant new opportunities to EVA exploration in both microgravity and surface environments. The suitport concept will enable three main improvements in EVA by providing reductions in: pre-EVA time from hours to less than thirty minutes; airlock consumables; contamination returned to the cabin with the EVA crewmember. Two second generation suitports were designed and tested. The previously reported second generation Marman Clamp suitport and a newer concept, the Pneumatic Flipper Suitport. These second generation suitports demonstrated human donning and doffing of the Z 1 spacesuit with an 8. 3 psi pressure differential across the spacesuit. Testing was performed using the JSC B 32 Chamber B, a human rated vacuum chamber. The test included human rated suitports, the suitport compatible prototype suit, and chamber modifications. This test brought these three elements together in the first ever pressurized donning of a rear entry suit through a suitport. This paper presents the results of the testing, including unexpected difficulties with doffing, and engineering solutions implemented to ease the difficulties. A review of suitport functions, including a discussion of the need to doff a pressurized suit in earth gravity, is included. Recommendations for future design and testing are documented...|$|E
40|$|The largest modern Pure Car and Truck Carriers (PCTC’s) are {{typically}} 230 meters long and have 13 cargo decks. In {{order to facilitate}} rapid loading and unloading these ships {{have been subject to}} a development of reducing any obstructing structures in the cargo hold, meaning that the transversal shear preventing structures, i. e. the racking bulkheads, has been taken to a minimum. Previous studies have concluded that some points on the racking bulkheads, {{as a result of the}} stripped down design, are subject to high stresses resulting from wave induced accelerations of the ship. In this M. Sc. Thesis the fatigue life of a corner of a transverse <b>bulkhead</b> <b>opening</b> in a 230 meter long PCTC with a capacity of 7200 cars is calculated with different methods. •Fatigue life is calculated from recorded ship motion data with the notch stress method in conjunction with rain flow counting and the cumulative damage principal. • Fatigue life is calculated according to (DNV CN. 30. 7, 2010), based on a Lloyd’s Register FE model load case. • Actual findings on the ship are compared to the calculated results. Due to the lack of inspection data this comparison is not very extensive and only more briefly discussed. It is concluded that the fatigue life of the examined point, calculated from recorded motion data is 9. 6 years and the fatigue life according to DNV is 8. 0 years. It is also found that the fatigue damage is cumulated in almost discrete portions and thus the calculated fatigue life can be inaccurate when a short period of time is evaluated as is done in this thesis. A modification to the racking bulkhead with respect to fatigue life is also analyzed and it is concluded that the fatigue life in the examined point could be extended significantly by some simple modifications to the geometry...|$|E

To date, the first generation suitport has been tested with mockup suits on the rover cabins and pressurized on a bench top engineering unit. The work on the rover cabin has helped define the operational concepts and timelines, and has demonstrated the potential of suitport to save significant amounts of crew time before and after EVAs. The work with the engineering unit has successfully demonstrated the pressurizable seal concept including the ability to seal after the introduction and removal of contamination to the sealing surfaces. Using this experience, a second generation suitport was designed. This second generation suitport has been tested with a space suit prototype on the second generation MMSEV cabin, and testing is planned using the pressure differentials of the spacecraft. Pressurized testing will be performed using the JSC B 32 Chamber B, a human rated vacuum chamber. This test will include human rated suitports, a suitport compatible prototype suit, and chamber modifications. This test will bring these three elements together in the first ever pressurized donning of a rear entry suit through a suitport. This paper presents the design of a human rated second generation suitport, the design of a suit capable of supporting pressurized human donning through a suitport, ambient pressure testing of the suit with the suitport, and modifications to the JSC human rated chamber B to accept a suitport. Design challenges and solutions, as well as compromises required to develop the system, are presented. Initial human testing results are presented...|$|E
