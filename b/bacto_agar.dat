40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{literature}} exists on the systematics and ecology of free-living marine and brackish-water nematodes, key questions on the nature and magnitude of interactions between nematodes and other organisms in the benthos remain unanswered. Relatively few authors have investigated live nematodes in food web studies or in experiments dealing with the nematodes' response to a varying environment. It is mainly for the latter purpose that {{attempts have been made to}} maintain, rear and cultivate selected species. This paper describes the methodology used for the maintenance, rearing, and eventual permanent agnotobiotic cultivation of a variety of estuarine nematodes. Spot plates, where small samples of sediment or macrophyte material are inoculated on a sloppy agar layer, have been used for the purpose of maintenance and initial cultivation. Those species that reproduce on spot plates are then selected for monospecific cultivation on agar layers with different nutrient enrichments and with micro-organisms cotransferred from the spot plates as food. Mixtures of <b>bacto</b> and nutrient <b>agar</b> prepared in artificial seawater were specifically suitable for the xenic cultivation of nine bacterivorous and, when supplied with Erdschreiber nutrients, two algivorous/bacterivorous nematode species. Up to three generations of five other nematode species have been reared under laboratory conditions, and several more were kept alive and active for variable periods of time on agar. Generation times observed on spot plates for Adoncholaimus fuscus and Oncholaimus oxyuris were substantially shorter than previously published estimates and suggest a correspondingly higher predatory and scavenging potency for these and related enoplids. A procedure for the long-term storage of nematodes at - 80 degrees C with glycerol as a cryoprotectant was successfully used for Diplolaimella dievengatensis, Panagrolaimus sp. 1, and Pellioditis marina, but not for Diplolaimelloides meyli. The authors have also summarized the existing literature on the cultivation of marine and brackish-water nematodes. Continuous cultivation appears to have been successful mainly for Aufwuchs and epiphytic nematodes; only few sediment-dwellers have been established in permanent culture. Of only just over 30 species that have ever been cultivated, more than half belong to one family (Monhysteridae) and three are Rhabditida, an order poorly represented in the marine environment. Four species have been grown in monoxenic and one in axenic culture, the latter though with limited success. It is concluded that our understanding of the basic nutritional requirements of marine nematodes is as yet insufficient, and that the culture techniques which have so far mainly deployed agar or Liquid substrates, while being suitable for the cultivation of Aufwuchs and epiphytic nematodes, do not accurately enough mimic gradients specific of the natural habitat of many sediment-dwellers...|$|R

For our study, we chose the bacterium Bacillus subtillis and Proteus mirabilis, and the acellular myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. Bacteria were dot-‐inoculated in 1. 5 % <b>Bacto</b> <b>Agar,.</b> 1 % peptone media {{that served as the}} model system for fractal chemotaxis. The media that tested negative chemotaxis due to acid production included 10 mM Tris at pH 9 and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7. Additionally, the influence of excess buffers has been investigated using 100 mM Tris at pH 9 and 7. Half of the microorganisms were grown in the influence of ~ 60 mT static magnetic field, and the others in an Oscillating Magnetic Field with flux density 4700 A/m^ 2. Images of fractal morphology were subjected to a standardized image processing protocol using the program PIXLR, while fractal analysis was performed using the program ImageJ and the plug-‐in FRACLAC. Preliminary results show qualitative changes in growth due to alternating and static magnetic fields, as well as changes in bacterial morphology when placed in a buffered environment.

Response of Syngonium {{podophyllum}} L. ‘White Butterfly’ shoot cultures {{to alternative}} media additives and gelling agents, and flow cytometric analysis of regenerants. Nusantara Bioscience 7 : 26 - 32. Syngonium podophyllum L. (arrowhead vine) {{is a popular}} leafy indoor pot plant whose tissue culture has been established, primarily through in vitro shoot culture, but several interesting aspects {{have not yet been}} explored. In this study, cv. ‘White Butterfly’ was used to investigate the response of shoot formation to alternative gelling agents and media additives. Gellan gum (Gelrite®) at 2 g/L resulted in greater leaf production, plantlet fresh weight and higher chlorophyll content (SPAD value) than all other gelling agents tested, including agar, <b>Bacto</b> <b>agar,</b> phytagel, oatmeal agar, potato dextrose agar, barley starch and corn starch, when on a basal Hyponex® (NPK = 6. 5 : 6 : 19; 3 g/L) medium. Several alternative liquid medium additives tested (low and full fat milk, Coca-Cola®, coffee, Japanese green, Oolong and Darjeeling teas) negatively impacted plant growth, stunted roots and decreased chlorophyll content (SPAD value) of leaves. Plant growth on medium with refined sucrose or table sugar responded similarly. Poor growth was observed when crude extract from a high rebaudioside-containing stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) line - an artificial sweetener - was used. Leaf tissue from the control did not show any endopolyploidy but low levels of endopolyploidy (8 C) were detected in some treatments...|$|E
30|$|The {{chemotaxis}} {{of strain}} CNP- 8 toward (chloro)nitrophenols was investigated as described (Arora and Bae 2014), with minor modification. For drop plate assay, strains SJ 98 was grown in MSM[*]+[*]LB (v/v[*]=[*] 4 : 1) to exponential phase, and then induced by 0.3  mM of target substrate (2 C 4 NP, 2 C 5 NP, PNP or MNP) for 8  h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 10  min, washed twice with MSM, resuspended in the drop plate assay medium (MSM with 0.3 % <b>bacto</b> <b>agar)</b> and transferred into petri-plate. Crystals of (chloro)nitrophenols were {{placed at the}} center of the plate and then incubated at 30  °C for 8 – 12  h. For quantitative capillary assay, the solutions of each substrate at different concentrations (from 0.05 to 0.7  mM in chemotaxis buffer which contained 100  mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 20  μM EDTA) were filled into 10  μl glass capillaries. The capillaries were inserted into the cell suspension of strain CNP- 8 (~[*] 1011  cells/mL) on a glass slide. The capillary tube containing chemotaxis buffer [100  mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) with 20  μM EDTA] was used as control. After 30  min incubation at 30  °C, the solutions in the capillaries were diluted serially and spread onto LB plates. The total number of colony forming units (CFUs) was determined after 48  h incubation at 30  °C. The chemotaxis index (CFUs produced from capillary containing the target substrate/CFUs from a control capillary) was used to quantify the chemotactic response.|$|E
30|$|For {{microscopic}} {{observation of}} sporulation, each strain was sporulated using KAc agar containing 10  g/L KAc and 20  g/L <b>Bacto</b> <b>agar</b> for 7  days at 30 °C {{in the manner}} described earlier. After incubation, spores {{were removed from the}} surface of the agar medium by washing with 0.05 % Tween 80 in saline solution. The suspension was centrifuged at 3, 000 [*]×[*]g for 10  min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into fresh tube and kept at 4 °C until use. To confirm sporulation using the Wirtz-Conklin spore staining technique [34], the spores were strained with 5 % brilliant (malachite) green (dye for staining spores) solution on a slide, heated with a Bunsen flame for 5  min and washed with MilliQ water, then counterstained with 0.5 % safranin (dye for staining vegetative cells) solution for 1  min. Staining was conducted before and after swelling the cell by soaking in saline solution for a few days. After drying, the slide was observed under a light microscope. SEM observation was also performed to confirm the morphology of ascospores from each strain. The spores were fixed overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 % (vol./vol.-PBS buffer) glutaraldehyde, washed three times with PBS buffer, dehydrated in an ethanol series, then dried at room temperature. After coating with Pt-Pd using a sputter coater (Hitachi E 102 Ion Sputter, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) for 2  min at DC 20 mA, spore samples were observed with SEM (Hitachi S- 4700 Type II, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 10  kV.|$|E
30|$|Six Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strains {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} resistance to BB in the mapping population. These strains included four African Xoo strains: BAI 3 and NAI 8 (race A 1) from Burkina-Faso and Niger respectively, BAI 4 (race A 2) from Burkina-Faso, MAI 1 (race A 3) from Mali and two Asian strains PXO 61 (Philippines race 1) and PXO 86 (Philippines race 2). The bacterial strains were cultured on PSA medium (per liter of H 2 O, 10  g of peptone, 10  g of sucrose, 1  g of glutamic acid, and 16  g of <b>bacto</b> <b>agar</b> at pH  7.0) overnight. Inoculum was prepared by re-suspending bacterial culture in sterile, distilled water at an optical density of 0.2 (DO 600), bearing approximately 108  cfu per ml. The progenies and their parents were grown under controlled conditions (28  °C; 80  % humidity and 12  h day length) in greenhouse at IRD Montpellier/France. They were inoculated at the booting stage (6 weeks after germination) using the leaf-clipping method (Kauffman et al. 1973) in which the fully-opened leaves were cut with scissors dipped in the bacterial suspension. Ten plants per genotype and two uppermost fully expanded and randomly chosen leaves were inoculated with each strain. Phenotypic evaluations, consisting of the disease scoring, were done 3  weeks after inoculation by measuring the leaf lesion length. Disease reactions were classified according to the mean lesion length (LL) as following: resistant (R) if the lesion length was[*]<[*] 5  cm, moderately resistant (MR) with LL of 5 to 10  cm; moderately susceptible (MS) with LL of 10 to 15  cm, susceptible (S) with LL[*]>[*] 15  cm.|$|E
30|$|Wheat {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 10 areas of 6 cities and counties from northern Taiwan to southern Taiwan. Potential Fusarium head blight pathogens of wheat were isolated from seeds and wheat heads showing head blight symptoms. In areas of southern Taiwan where Fusarium head blight was not observed, around 100 wheat heads were randomly collected from each field for fungal isolation. For isolating fungi from diseased or symptomless wheat heads, 10 every other kernels were picked from bottom to top of a head, and incubated on 2 % (w/v) water agar (WA) {{at room temperature for}} 3 – 5  days. After fungi grew out, one isolate was picked from each head for further study. Therefore, all isolates were obtained from different plants. A modified blotter method (De Tempe 1953) was used for fungal isolation from seeds. Briefly, seeds were treated with 1 % sodium chloride for 1  min, rinsed with sterilized water for 3 times, and then incubated on a piece of wet autoclaved filter paper in 9 -cm Petri dishes at 24  °C for 7  days. Ten seeds were plated in each plate, and 400 seeds were randomly sampled from each bag of seeds. Fungal colonies secreting carmine red pigment in WA or filter paper and producing characterized spindle-sickle macroconidia were selected for further purification. Single macroconidium of Fusarium was isolated for analyses. For morphological analysis, Fusarium isolates were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco, NJ, USA) to observe culture characteristics and carnation leaf agar (CLA) to examine the morphology of macroconidia (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Thirty macroconidia with 4 – 5 septa from each isolate were measured to determine the conidial size. Perithecia were induced on carrot medium (5  g of <b>Bacto</b> <b>agar,</b> 400  g freshly sliced carrots, per liter of distilled water) (Cavinder et al. 2012). Ascospores released from asci were measured and characterized.|$|E
40|$|Hyperhydricity, an {{abnormal}} morphological appearance and physiological function, {{is an important}} problem in carnation tissue culture. The problem causes premature flowering, high occurrence of abnormal shoots, difficulty in transferring hyperhydric plantlets to soil, and low survival rate of plantlets. High relative humidity and the water potential are considered as the key factors involved in the abnormality. Furthermore, permeable culture vessel and gelling agent were assured to be high potential treatment to eliminate it. Objective {{of this research was}} to reduce  hyperhydricity in regenerants of carnation using different permeable vessel closures and gelling agents and to assess the multiplication and  acclimatization abilities of recovered shoots. Experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design with four replications. First factor was different types of closure, i. e. cotton wool, plastic wrap, parafilm and aluminium foil, while second one was gelling agents, i. e. <b>bacto</b> <b>agar,</b> phytagel, swallow agar, and Type 900 agar. The recovered shoots were then multiplied, rooted, and acclimatized. The results showed that hyperhydricity was successfully reduced by applying permeable closure (cotton wool and plastic wrap) in combination with Type 900 agar. The combination of plastic wrap and Type 900 agar was the most appropriate treatment in reducing hyperhydricity and producing good quality shoots. The treatment reduced the problem down to 23 % of total condition of hyperhydricity (100 %) and increased leaf chlorophyll content from 0. 0883 to 0. 1288 mg mg- 1. The plastic wrap was easily applied and cheaper material compared to cotton wool. The recovered shoots were able to produce 1 - 3 healthy axillary shoots and easily rooted on half-strength MS. The recovered plantlets were simply acclimatized with survival rate up to 100 % on kossas peat + soil (1 : 1, v/v) and flowered 4 - 5 months after acclimatization with decreasing in number and size of flower...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a fairly}} common {{experience}} in laboratories using the standard AR- 339 strain of Sindbis virus to observe variations in the plaque size of this virus [1 - 4]. The sizes range from large to small, and include in some cases intermediate plaque variants [3] and an "unusually " large plaque (U) obtained after cloning of a parent small plaque variant at 40 C [4]. We have used Sindbis virus extensively as an interferon inducer in cell cultures [5 - 7] and in "systemic induction " [8]; that is, {{in the production of}} serum interferon shortly after 'a large dose of virus is inoculated intravenously in rabbits and before the virus replicates to any significant extent [9 - 11]. In the course of using Sindbis virus, we have noted occasional large plaques (~ 5 mm) among the usual smaller plaques (~ 2 mm) in chick embryo cell cultures under <b>Bacto</b> <b>agar</b> (Difco). Recently, to study how variants of 1 virus may differ in the systemic induction of interferon [12], we decided to study the systemic interferon-inducing capacity of small plaque (SP) and large plaque (LP) variants of Sindbis virus. Preliminary results revealed not only that the LP variant induced more serum interferon in animals, but also that it was cleared from the blood stream at a much slower rate. This paper describes this phenomenon, and a companion paper describes the characteristics of the variants. Received for publication March 7, 1969, and in re-vised form May 7, 1969.

30|$|Single colonies from fresh LB {{agar plates}} were patched onto minimal media (Mm) agar plates (0.1  % NaNO 3, 0.1  % K 2 HPO 4, 0.05  % MgSO 4, 0.1  % KCl, 0.05  % yeast extract and 1.5  % <b>Bacto</b> <b>agar)</b> pH 7.0, {{incubated}} at 37  °C, and supplemented {{with the appropriate}} substrate for extracellular hydrolytic enzyme detection (Charbonneau et al. 2011). For the detection of extracellular enzyme activity, buffered Mm was supplemented with the following substrates: glyceryl tributyrate 1  % (v/v) for esterase activity; olive oil 1  % (v/v) containing Rhodamine B 0.001  % (w/v) for detection of lipolytic activity (Fariha et al. 2010; Gupta et al. 2004; Jaeger and Reetz 1998); carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) 0.5  % (w/v) for CMCase activity and Phosphoric Acid Swollen Avicel (PASA) 0.1  % (w/v) for PASAase activity (Kubicek et al. 2009; Singh and Prabhu 1986; Wang et al. 2010). Remazol Brillant Blue-xylan (RBB-xylan) from beechwood 0.5  % (w/v) was used for xylanase activity. Starch 1  % (w/v) was used for amylase activity (Meddeb-Mouelhi et al. 2015; Nigam and Singh 1995) and 1  % of casein (w/v) was used for protease activity (Nigam and Pandey 2009; Nigam et al. 2013; Van Dyke 2004). Lipolytic activity was visualized by illuminating the plate with UV light (302  nm) which results in an orange fluorescence detected at 535  nm around colony producing lipase (Patil et al. 2011; Sharyo 1993). Extracellular esterase activity was observed by appearance of a clear zone around the colonies (Kuhad et al. 1997; Meddeb-Mouelhi et al. 2015). CMCase and PASAase activities were detected by staining the plates using 0.2  % Congo red for 15  min and then de-stained by washing twice with 1  M NaCl for 15  min (Meddeb-Mouelhi et al. 2015). Xylanase positives clones were identified by a clear zone around the colonies on RBB-xylan plate (Meddeb-Mouelhi et al. 2015). Industrial enzymes (lipases, cellulases, xylanases and esterases purchased from Buckman North America) were used as positive controls.|$|E
