5|$|Drenović {{subsequently}} led Serb-chauvinist agitation {{within the}} Partisan 3rd Krajina Detachment. After some vacillation, he eventually {{sided with the}} royalist Chetniks and became a Chetnik commander (vojvoda). In April 1942, he was defeated by the Partisans and fled to <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka,</b> where he concluded an alliance with the Ustaše to fight the Partisans. He continued to oppose the Partisans until his death during an Allied bombing raid on <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an immediate cause for the action, but the veracity of the incident has since been questioned. Borisav Jović, a contemporary high-ranking Serbian official {{and member of the}} Yugoslav Presidency, has claimed that the report was just wartime propaganda, stating that <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> had two bottled oxygen production plants in its immediate vicinity and was virtually self-reliant in that respect.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{violation}} to {{the no-fly zone}} came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down {{four of the six}} Serb jets over <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka.</b> This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> incident was also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E

50|$|During World War II most of <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> {{prominent}} Serbian and Sephardic Jewish {{families were}} deported to nearby Croatian concentration camps, such as Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška in Croatia. Today, <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> Jewish community is virtually non-existent. A spike in Serbian immigration was mostly noted {{after the earthquake}} of 1969, when the city has seen a boom in housing construction.|$|R
5|$|Following its {{successful}} defence of Bosanski Brod in March, the HVO, {{reinforced by}} HV troops, pushed the JNA and the VRS south {{from the town}} and captured the towns of Modriča and Derventa {{by the end of}} May. The capture of Derventa also severed the last road available to the Bosnian Serbs spanning VRS-controlled western Bosnia around <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> and the VRS-held territory in the east of the country, adjacent to Serbia. That prevented the supply of <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> as well as the bulk of the territory gained by the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and Croatian Serbs in Croatia since the initial phase of the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> {{air base}} was {{reinforced}} by a newly formed 5th Group {{after the end of}} Case White. The ZNDH now consisted of three air bases with six Groups and 14 squadrons. During 1943 new aircraft continued to arrive, with 30 overhauled Dornier Do 17E bombers delivered from Germany and divided between the 3rd Squadron (Zagreb), and the 13th and 15th Squadrons (<b>Banja</b> <b>Luka).</b> From Italy came 34 long promised ex-VVKJ Bücker Bü 131 Jungmans and 25 Saiman 200 light biplane trainers and liaison aircraft, which were dispatched to all three air bases. They were also used to deliver mail and fresh meat to isolated/surrounded towns and garrisons.|$|E
5|$|An ad-hoc Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion {{manned by}} officer cadets, with 1st Company of the 202nd Panzer Battalion, {{under the command}} of the 7th SS Division, was to advance from <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> toward Ključ to seize the {{crossing}} point across the Sana utilised by the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|On 17 September, U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith {{met with}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in Zagreb. Holbrooke was {{directed}} by the United States to urge Tuđman to stop offensive operations by the HV in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, Holbrooke and Galbraith thought the instructions unwise and saw the opportunity to defeat the VRS and establish a new military balance in the country. Holbrooke also considered that the changing {{situation on the ground}} allowed him and Galbraith to ignore the instructions. Holbrooke urged Tuđman to capture Sanski Most, Novi Grad and Prijedor from the VRS, and to do so quickly, but asked him to stop short of capturing <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka.</b> Holbrooke and Galbraith considered it would be advantageous for them and that justice would be served if the VRS lost <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka,</b> but decided against encouraging it, fearing there would be another 200,000 refugees from the city or that Croatia would not be willing to relinquish control of <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> later on. They were also hoping that more moderate Bosnian Serb leadership might be found in the city, as it was the most urban Bosnian Serb area.|$|E
5|$|Operation Mistral 2, {{along with}} the near-concurrent Operation Sana, created {{a large number of}} {{refugees}} from the areas previously controlled by the VRS. Their number was variously reported and the estimates range from 655 killed civilians and 125,000 refugees, reported by Radio-Television Republika Srpska in 2010, to approximately 40,000 refugees reported in 1995—both by Bosnian Serb sources. The latter figure was reported to encompass the entire contemporary populations of the towns of Jajce, Šipovo, Mrkonjić Grad and Donji Vakuf fleeing or being evacuated. At the time, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo estimated the number of refugees at 20,000. The refugees fled to VRS-controlled areas around Brčko and <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka,</b> adding to the 50,000 refugees who had been sheltering in <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> since Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the northern}} column of the 14th Panzer Division drove via Glina {{and crossed the}} Una at both Bosanska Kostajnica and Bosanski Novi before continuing its push east. Elements of LI Infantry Corps also pushed east, establishing bridgeheads over the Kupa. A fragment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, numbering around 300 troops, which had been holding {{a position on the}} Sava at Bosanska Gradiška, retreated to Jajce via <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka.</b> When they arrived at Jajce, Nedeljković ordered them to take up blocking positions on the narrow Vrbas valley at Krupa on the road between <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> and Mrkonjić Grad. The rear area units of the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska were ordered to block the road from Kotor Varoš to Doboj.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneously, {{the same}} two teams made the FIBA Korać Cup final played in late March 1978 in <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> Borik Hall — Bosna's first-ever European final. In a game of great quality in front of 6,000 fans, the score {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} was tied 101-101, requiring overtime in which Bosna succumbed 110-117 to Partizan team that got a great contribution from its stars Dražen Dalipagić and Dragan Kićanović with 48 and 33 points, respectively.|$|R
5|$|Thanks to this {{extended}} aircraft {{park the}} ZNDH could now form new units: in January the 1st Group, comprising the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 19th Squadrons was formed at Zagreb, {{and then the}} 2nd Group with the 4th, 5th and 6th squadrons and the 3rd Group with the 7th, 8th and 9th Squadrons at Sarajevo's Rajlovac airfield, whilst the 6th Group was formed at <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> Zaluzani airfield in June 1942 to cover operations in central Croatia and western Bosnia.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-January 2008, {{the movie}} was {{released}} in the countrys Serbian part where audiences largely ignored it with a premiere in <b>Banja</b> <b>Lukas</b> Kozara theater attended by fewer than 15 people. The reviews in the countrys Serb media were generally negative: Nezavisne novines Davor Pavlović refers to the film as being [...] "poorly directed" [...] and concludes that its main flaws lay in [...] "neither being able to treat the subject matter with sufficient seriousness nor to raise its dramaturgical level above that of a typical Hollywood action movie".|$|R
5|$|During the 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia, the 5th (<b>Banja</b> <b>Luka)</b> Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) was tasked with advancing north through western Slavonia from Okučani to Daruvar and Virovitica {{and with a}} secondary drive from Okučani towards Kutina. This was essentially consistent with the line expected to be reached by {{the main thrust of}} the JNA, advancing from eastern Slavonia in about a week. The link was designed to facilitate a further advance west, to Zagreb and Varaždin. The corps had deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okučani, supporting an advance which began on 21 September and reached the Papuk Mountains. The corps received one artillery and two motorised brigades as reinforcements during the advance, but the desertion and morale problems experienced by the JNA elsewhere also existed in the <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} JNA and TO forces deployed {{opposite the}} Posavina OG comprised approximately 13,500 troops, subordinated to the JNA 5th (<b>Banja</b> <b>Luka)</b> Corps. In the area, the corps had {{at its disposal}} a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade, the 6th and the 10th Partisan Brigades, and the 16th Motorised Brigade, supported by the SAO Western Slavonia TO. In {{the second half of}} December, the <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> Corps was reinforced by the addition of three motorised battalions and an armoured battalion, drawn from the 84th Motorised Brigade (from Bitola), and the 125th Motorised Brigade (from Titova Mitrovica). In addition, the 134th Light Infantry Brigade was brought in as a reinforcement from Titovo Užice on 31 December. The corps was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel General Nikola Uzelac.|$|E

50|$|Although she did {{not pursue}} her {{education}} any further, Maglajlić became acquainted with Marxism and the labour movement through her brothers, who studied in Sarajevo and Zagreb. She {{was among the first}} Bosnian Muslim women {{to take part in the}} labour movement and through it became more closely involved with the women's rights movement. She was also active in the International Red Aid, and later presided over <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> women's organization. Her father allowed her to stop wearing her veil, but she outraged her family and townspeople by cutting her hair short. Maglajlić received marriage offers but on the condition that she quit her activism, and thus never married. She confided in her sister-in-law Ruža that the only man she could marry was the one she was dating, but her parents were unlikely to approve because he was an Orthodox Christian.|$|R
2500|$|The {{appeal of}} Kočić's {{political}} pronouncements among Bosnian Serbs extended {{across the political}} spectrum. During World War II, the Serbian nationalist Chetniks and the communist Partisans, both of whose members were predominantly Serbs, upheld Kočić as a hero. This manifested itself {{in the creation of}} the [...] "Petar Kočić" [...] Chetnik Detachment, under the command of Uroš Drenović. In Partisan propaganda, Kočić was lauded as an anti-German revolutionary who fought to liberate Bosnia and Herzegovina from foreign oppression. During the socialist period, which lasted between 1945 and 1991, Kočić's Serb heritage was deliberately understated in schoolbooks, and schoolchildren were taught to regard him as an exclusively Bosnian historical and literary figure. Following Yugoslavia's disintegration, Kočić's profile was used on Republika Srpska 5,000 to 500 million dinar notes. In 1998, his likeness began to appear on 100 KM notes, which became official tender following the Dayton Agreement. Numerous streets in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro bear his name. During the Bosnian War, a Sarajevo street named after Kočić was renamed, as part of the Muslim-dominated central government's plan to reduce the number of city streets named after non-Muslims. Before the war, <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> central library carried Kočić's name, but was later renamed the National Library of Republika Srpska. One of the city's largest parks continues to bear his name; at its centre is a life-sized statue of the writer.|$|R
5|$|In April 1943, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, {{was invited}} by Berger {{to assist in}} organising and {{recruiting}} Muslims into the Waffen-SS and other units.

The Mufti successfully convinced the Muslims to ignore the declarations of the Sarajevo, Mostar and <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> Ulama (Islamic clerics), who in 1941 forbade them from collaborating with the Ustaše.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, the JNA <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> Corps {{initiated}} probing {{attacks in}} western Slavonia, presaging {{a major effort}} employing {{the bulk of the}} corps three days later.

By that time, the JNA campaign in western Slavonia had lost its momentum.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 1944, Drenović {{was killed}} in an Allied bombing raid on <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka.</b> The Ravna Gora Movement and Serbian Orthodox Church in Klisina organise a {{ceremony}} each year to commemorate Drenović's actions in 1941.

50|$|In {{the season}} of 2010-11, Olimpik barely missed the spot for the {{qualifying}} phase of Europe League, finishing 5th place in the league. In the subsequent season of 2011-12 they didn't play up to par in their first two matches (they had one draw and one loss, although being candidates {{for one of the}} top places of the table) of the championship, resulting in a mutual agreement between the club and manager for a managerial change, with Mehmed Janjoš being replaced by his assistant, Nedim Jusufbegović. He continued to lead the team on to land on the same 5th place in the league as they did last year, but this time even closer to Europe than before, only two points away, and a goal difference far superior to 13 out of the other 15 clubs participating in the Premier League. The following year in 2012-13 started out with two draws against two weaker teams, namely OFK Gradina Srebrenik and FK Rudar Prijedor, as well as a bare victory against another weak team GOSK Gabela, and a loss against FK Sarajevo. Therefore, Jusufbegović was replaced in September 2012 by Husref Musemić who led the team throughout a successful campaign helping the team insure a confident third place right up until after the winter break when FK Sarajevo placed an offer on the table for the manager, and so Denis Sadiković was appointed in February as manager, whose start was somewhat better than Jusufbegović's, but after a series of unsuccessful games and the team's slow demise, he was replaced with Nedim Jusufbegović. And the third time the coach returned to the team he is currently coaching, he was a mere victory away from landing the team a spot for European competition, but fell in the very last match unfortunately, and stuck to a well-deserved finish at the by-now traditional 5th position on the table for Olimpik. Part of what caused the club not to do better than they did last year could be blamed on one of the matches against FK Velež Mostar which resulted in a 1-1 draw, where the referee Eldis Prošić's decisions were questionable, and caused a lot of irritation among Olimpik's players, the manager as well as the fans. However {{this was not the first}} time Olimpik has been dealt with unfairly, within the first half of {{the season of}} 2012-13, there have been complaints about at least another four games where allegedly it has been suspected that the team is being intentionally given incorrect refereeing decisions. Due to this, the team has been on the verge to opt out of the league altogether, much like FK Borac <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka's</b> own situation at the end of the season where complaints came aimed at the national association from several clubs. Much to the surprise of most fans of many clubs in the top of the league that very season, the teams between third and eighth position were all refused an UEFA license for participation in Europa League 2013-14, save for NK Široki Brijeg, and in the end HŠK Zrinjski Mostar were the ones to receive the final spot for the competition.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> Corps was {{tasked with}} the main axis of advance from Okučani to Daruvar and Virovitica in western Slavonia, and a {{secondary}} drive from Okučani towards Kutina. This task {{was consistent with the}} line expected to be reached by the main thrust of the JNA advancing from the east in about a week. The Corps had already deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okučani to support the advance that started on 21 September, and reached the Papuk Mountains. The Corps received two motorised brigades and one artillery brigade as reinforcements during the advance, but the problems with morale and desertions experienced in eastern Slavonia were also present in the <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> Corps. In one such instance, the 130th Mechanised Brigade, sent as a reinforcement, had been reduced to a 280-strong battalion by 29 September. The JNA was stopped by the ZNG between Novska, Nova Gradiška and Pakrac, even though some Croatian Serb militia units took positions on the Bilogora and Papuk north of Pakrac near Virovitica, and Slatina, with no JNA support.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} Chetnik commanders, Baćović carried out {{numerous}} massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians and those {{sympathetic to the}} Partisan movement. In April 1945, he was captured near <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić, and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what was apparently a trap. According to some sources, Baćović {{and the others were}} taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where they were killed.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka,</b> dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons. However, {{the troops were}} not briefed on the operation until {{a few hours before}} it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{resulted in}} 178 dead, 588 wounded and 41 captured ARBiH troops. Bosnian Serb losses were 900 killed {{and more than}} 1,000 wounded. In September and October, 6,500 Bosniak and Croat civilians living {{in the area of}} <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> or Prijedor were expelled from their homes by Bosnian Serb forces. Changes of control of territory also allowed access to two mass graves near Sanski Most, believed to contain the bodies of 300 civilians killed by Bosnian Serb forces in April 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{personnel}} of the ZNDH {{took over}} and re-activated the airfields at Zagreb, Sarajevo, Mostar, <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> and Zemun, where the Ikarus and Zmaj aircraft plants were located. By June 1941, the Germans had begun {{to pass on to}} the ZNDH various captured VVKJ aircraft, including eight Bristol Blenheim I and five Potez 25 bombers. These and most of the 211 ex-VVKJ aircraft received by the ZNDH had first to be repaired and/or overhauled at the Ikarus plant in Zemun.|$|E
5|$|While the {{fighting}} related to Operation Corridor 92 {{was still in}} progress, the VRS prepared to attack and destroy a salient around the town of Jajce in central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, held jointly by the HVO and the ARBiH. The salient threatened Bosnian Serb lines of communication south of VRS-held <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> and contained two hydroelectric power plants critical for electrical supply of <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> region. The salient was held by between 3,400 and 5,500 HVO and ARBiH troops manning strong fortifications in difficult terrain. The VRS committed 7,000–8,000 troops of the 30th Infantry Division of the 1st Krajina Corps to the offensive codenamed Operation Vrbas '92. The 30th Division was under command of Colonel Stanislav Galić, until he was replaced by Colonel Dragan Marčetić in early September. The VRS troops included the 1st, 11th and 17th Light Infantry Brigades and 1st Mixed Antitank Artillery Battalion. Besides the numerical superiority, the VRS held a clear advantage in armour, deploying 20–30 tanks and adding 30–50 heavy artillery pieces to the force. Defence of Jajce was organised at municipal crisis headquarters level by mayor Midhat Karadžić, while the HVO force in Jajce was commanded by Stjepan Blažević.|$|E
5|$|Following {{news of the}} fighting, the 5th (<b>Banja</b> <b>Luka)</b> Corps {{called on}} its troops {{deployed}} in western Slavonia to reinforce the 30th Partisan Division. The corps felt it could weaken its positions in western Slavonia because the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) peacekeepers were expected to deploy there {{by the end of}} the month based on the Vance plan. Those troops consisted of the Volunteer Battalion of the 5th Corps, and they were augmented by the 2nd Howitzer Battalion of the 5th Mixed Artillery Regiment. The 1st Battery of the 5th Light Anti-Aircraft Defence Regiment was also added to the battalion.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Nedeljković's request for reinforcements, Simović {{had sent a}} number of units by rail via Tuzla. These included a cadet battalion and a company of the 27th Infantry Regiment, detached from the 1st Infantry Division Cerska. By the time the reinforcements arrived, <b>Banja</b> <b>Luka</b> had been evacuated {{in the face of}} German tanks and an Ustaše-led revolt. The cadet battalion was redirected to Ključ to block the road KljučMrkonjić GradJajce. Nedeljković did not have the option of withdrawing via Bugojno or Prozor as those towns had been taken over by the Ustaše.|$|E
