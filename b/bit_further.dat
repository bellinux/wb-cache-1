The term Hh ≤ lg |Σ | denotes the hth-order empirical entropy of the text, which means that our index is nearly optimal in space apart from lower-order terms, achieving asymptotically the empirical entropy of the text (with a multiplicative constant 1). If the text is highly compressible so that Hh = o(1) and the alphabet size is small, we obtain a text index with o(m) search time that requires only o(n) <b>bits.</b> <b>Further</b> results and tradeoffs are reported in the paper. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{fingerprinting}} is {{an effective}} method to identify users who might try to redistribute multimedia content, such as images and video. These fingerprints are typically embedded into the content using watermarking techniques {{that are designed to}} be robust to a variety of attacks. A cheap and effective attack against such digital fingerprints is collusion, where several differently marked copies of the same content are averaged or combined to disrupt the underlying fingerprint. In this paper, we study the problem of designing fingerprints that can withstand collusion, yet trace colluders. Since, in antipodal CDMA-type watermarking, the correlation contributions only decrease where watermarks differ, by constructing binary code vectors where any subset of k or fewer of these vectors have unique overlap, we may identify groups of k or less colluders. Our construction of such anti-collusion codes (ACC) uses the theory of combinatorial designs, and for n users requires O (√ n) <b>bits.</b> <b>Further,</b> we explore a block matrix structure for the ACC that reduces the computational complexity for identifying colluders and improves the detection capability when colluders belong to the same subgroup. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{address a}} {{sequential}} decision problem that arises in the computation of symmetric Boolean functions of distributed data. We consider a collocated network, where each node's transmissions {{can be heard}} by every other node. Each node has a Boolean measurement and we wish to compute a given Boolean function of these measurements. We suppose that the measurements are independent and Bernoulli distributed. Thus, the problem of optimal computation becomes the problem of optimally ordering node's transmissions so as to minimize the total expected number of bits. We solve the ordering problem for the class of Boolean threshold functions. The optimal ordering is dynamic, i. e., it could potentially depend on the values of previously transmitted <b>bits.</b> <b>Further,</b> it depends only on the ordering of the marginal probabilites, but not on their exact values. This provides an elegant structure for the optimal strategy. For the case where each node has a block of measurements, the problem is significantly harder, and we conjecture the optimal strategy.

40|$|We present general {{symmetry}} {{arguments that}} show the appearance of doubly denerate states protected from external perturbations in a wide class of Hamiltonians. We construct the simplest spin Hamiltonian belonging to this class and study its properties both analytically and numerically. We find that this model generally {{has a number of}} low energy modes which might destroy the protection in the thermodynamic limit. These modes are qualitatively different from the usual gapless excitations as their number scales as the linear size (instead of volume) of the system. We show that the Hamiltonians with this symmetry can be physically implemented in Josephson junction arrays and that in these arrays one can eliminate the low energy modes with a proper boundary condition. We argue that these arrays provide fault tolerant quantum <b>bits.</b> <b>Further</b> we show that the simplest spin model with this symmetry can be mapped to a very special Z_ 2 Chern-Simons model on the square lattice. We argue that appearance of the low energy modes and the protected degeneracy is a natural property of lattice Chern-Simons theories.

40|$|Abstract—Symmetry {{breaking}} is {{a fundamental}} operation in distributed computing. It has applications to important problems such as graph vertex and edge coloring, maximal indepen-dent sets, and the like. Deterministic algorithms for symmetry breaking that run in a polylogarithmic number of rounds are not known. However, randomized algorithms that run in poly-logarithmic number of rounds are known starting from Luby’s algorithm [17]. Recently, orientation on edges was considered and it was shown that an O(∆) coloring of the vertices of a given oriented graph can be arrived at using essentially O(log ∆ + log n) bits of communication. In this paper we further demonstrate the power of orientation on edges in symmetry-breaking. We present efficient algorithms to construct fractional independent sets in constant degree graphs using very low order communication between the vertices. For instance, we show that in bounded degree graphs and planar graphs, {{it is possible to}} construct a fractional independent set by exchanging O(1) <b>bits.</b> <b>Further,</b> we present algorithms to construct maximal independent sets in bounded degree graphs and oriented trees.

40|$|In recent years, {{the chaos}} based {{cryptographic}} algorithms have suggested some new and efficient ways to develop secure image encryption techniques. In this communication, we propose {{a new approach}} for image encryption based on chaotic logistic maps {{in order to meet}} the requirements of the secure image transfer. In the proposed image encryption scheme, an external secret key of 80 -bit and two chaotic logistic maps are employed. The initial conditions for the both logistic maps are derived using the external secret key by providing different weightage to all its <b>bits.</b> <b>Further,</b> in the proposed encryption process, eight different types of operations are used to encrypt the pixels of an image and which one of them will be used for a particular pixel is decided by the outcome of the logistic map. To make the cipher more robust against any attack, the secret key is modified after encrypting each block of sixteen pixels of the image. The results of several experimental, statistical analysis and key sensitivity tests show that the proposed image encryption scheme provides an efficient and secure way for real-time image encryption and transmission. q 2006 Elsevier B.
