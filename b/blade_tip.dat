5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
25|$|In April 1964, {{contracted}} {{testing was}} completed with the Army. Bell immediately fitted the two-bladed rotor with tapered <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> caps for the company's own independent testing. The <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> modification allowed the helicopter to reach 193knots (222mph, 357km/h) using the maximum auxiliary thrust from the Continental turbojets. In {{an effort to}} achieve even higher speeds, Bell removed the J69-T-9 engines {{and replaced them with}} 1,700-pound (7.56kN) thrust J69-T-29 engines. The additional thrust helped make the 533 the first rotorcraft in history to exceed 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), reaching 205knots (236mph, 380km/h) on 15 October 1964.|$|E
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a rear-mounted engine and a pusher propeller. It also had tapered stub wings mounted high on the fuselage. In turn, twin tailbooms and twin vertical surfaces, interconnected by a horizontal stabilizer elevator, were mounted to the wings. A three-bladed main rotor powered by <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|E

40|$|Two {{strength}} level {{variations of}} sintered NiCrAl (about 40 percent dense), candidate high pressure turbine seal materials, {{were subject to}} rub tolerance testing against AM 355 steel <b>blade</b> <b>tips.</b> The high strength material (17 N/sq mm tensile strength) showed frictional and radial loads that were 20 to 50 percent higher than those measured for the low strength material (15. 5 N/ sq mm tensile strength). Measured wear to the AM 355 <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> was not significantly different for the two sintered NiCrAl seal materials. Wear of the sintered NiCrAl was characterized by material removal to a depth greater than the depth to which <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> were driven into the seal, indicating self-erosion effects...|$|R
25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the fan <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> speed to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the aircraft noise. Additionally other sound deadening measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{shape of}} the blade is oblong, drawn out at length at the tip. It is cut into four to six pairs of pinnae near the base, which {{diminish}} to lobes further above, and then merely to teeth in the long tip. The pinnae are stalked, more or less lack teeth, and are typically [...] long and [...] wide at the base. The lower pinnae have a distinct lobe or auricle pointing toward the <b>blade</b> <b>tip.</b> The dark color of the stipe extends some distance into the rachis (leaf axis), the rest of which is flat and green.

40|$|The sealing of the {{gas path}} in a gas turbine engine at the <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> is {{improved}} by maintaining a minimum clearance between the rotor <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> and the gas path seal.

2500|$|The eruptions and {{subsequent}} volcanic ash plumes caused extensive disruption to aviation movements across central and western Java in early November. Some flights {{to and from}} Bandung, Jakarta and Solo were effected and many international and domestic airlines suspended operations to and from those cities. Yogyakarta's Adisucipto International Airport was closed on many occasions in early November due to limited visibility and ash falls upon the runway, taxiway and terminal aprons. Adisucipto International Airport is the third busiest airport {{on the island of}} Java and lies approximately [...] to the south of Merapi. An Airbus A330-300 flight operated for Garuda Airlines as a Hajj pilgrimage from Solo's Adisumarmo International Airport [...] east of Merapi and travelling to Batam en route to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) was reported to have suffered from ash related engine damage on 28 October. It was however later reported to have suffered from <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> rubbing and was not apparently damaged by volcanic ash ingestion.|$|E

The mechanism includes a shaft and a bellcrank actuating assembly. The shaft is mounted through a passage defined by a mounting structure on the casing for radial movement along a longitudinal axis of the shaft toward and away from the rotor axis and is coupled at its inner end to the shroud segment. The bellcrank actuating assembly is coupled to an outer end of the shaft and mounted to the casing adjacent the shaft for pivotal movement about an axis spaced from and extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the shaft.

50|$|A balloon {{helicopter}} is {{a flying}} toy {{consisting of a}} latex toy balloon and a plastic propeller, derived from the simple balloon rocket. The most important feature is the hollow propeller hub which directs air into a passage in each propeller blade. The air passages channel air to the <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> such that air escapes in a fine jet tangentially. The air jets on the <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> causes the entire toy to spin, the blades have a positive angle of attack so the blades experience a lifting force as they push air downwards. It can attain a height of approximately 12 meters (40 feet). Full-scale helicopters have been built around this tip jet configuration.|$|R
40|$|Computations {{are made}} of the {{performance}} of a propeller designed to develop 56 thrust horsepower at 100 miles per hour. The fuel consumption of the jet-operated propeller would be considerably higher than that of a reciprocating engine and a propeller. The lighter weight of the jet-operated propeller will result in a lighter weight of engine plus fuel for short-range flights. A theoretical analysis is made of a propeller powered by gas jets issuing from the <b>blade</b> <b>tips.</b> In the propeller considered, the air is drawn through the hub and passes through the hollow propeller <b>blades</b> to the <b>tips,</b> where propellers heat the air and expel it through the nozzles in the <b>blade</b> <b>tips.</b> The reaction of the tips rotates the propeller. For long range flights, the weight of the jet-operated propeller with its fuel would be greater than the weight of a reciprocating engine with its propeller and fuel...|$|R
50|$|Special {{consideration}} {{is required for}} aircraft with large moving parts because pulse-Doppler radar operates like a phase-locked loop. <b>Blade</b> <b>tips</b> moving near {{the speed of sound}} produce the only signal that can be detected when a helicopter is moving slow near terrain and weather.|$|R
5000|$|Transonic drag {{near the}} rotor <b>blade</b> <b>tip.</b> The faster-moving {{advancing}} <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> {{may begin to}} approach the speed of sound, where transonic drag begins to rise steeply, and severe buffeting and vibration effects can occur. This effect prevents any further increase in speed, even if the helicopter has surplus power remaining, {{and even if it}} features a highly streamlined fuselage. A similar effect prevents propeller-driven aircraft from achieving supersonic speeds, although they can achieve higher speeds than a helicopter, since the propeller blade isn't advancing in the direction of travel.|$|E

The main rotor {{was taken from}} the S-61, but was modified to have a hub fairing, swept main rotor <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> and a special [...] "alpha-1" [...] linkage which was added to the main rotor controls to increase collective pitch sensitivity and so extend the collective pitch range. The 20° swept main rotor <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> help to overcome a phenomenon called sub-multiple oscillating track (SMOT) that causes variations in tip track at high Mach numbers. [...] These allowed the S-67 to achieve and maintain high cruise speeds. To reduce drag at high speed, the mainwheels retracted fully into the stub wing sponsons. It had speed brakes on the wing trailing edges {{that could be used to}} decrease speed or increase maneuverability.|$|R
