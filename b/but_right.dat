5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, <b>but</b> <b>Right</b> Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

25|$|The club founders, four Starostin brothers, {{played a}} big role in the {{formation}} of the team. The Starostins played for the red-whites in the 1930s <b>but</b> <b>right</b> before World War II they were subjected to repression as the leaders of the most hated team by the state authorities. Elder brother Nikolai Starostin wrote in his books that he had survived in the State Prison System due to his participation in football and with Spartak. After the political rehabilitation, in 1954, he would later return to the team as the squad's manager.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the strike}} did not meet with {{unanimous}} approval. Marginal Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP) threw its weight behind the strike, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> wing National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN) was opposed to it. Crucially, Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) declined to participate in it, so despite KPP support, the strike did not spread to the cities, as SL hoped. Notheless some worker strikes did occur during that period. Even within SL not all activists were convinced {{it was a good}} idea; it was supported by Wincenty Witos and Stanisław Mikołajczyk, but criticized by Maciej Rataj.|$|E
25|$|In a {{burst of}} anger, Golightly {{transforms}} into the Vespiform and threatens the guests. Agatha grabs the necklace and lures him away while driving towards the nearby Silent Pool, with the Doctor and Donna close behind. When they catch up with Agatha, Donna grabs the necklace from her and throws it into the water, prompting the wasp to dive in after it and drown. Due to her own connection with the necklace, Agatha suffers as the wasp dies, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> before the end he severs the link, sparing Agatha but rendering her unconscious. The Doctor realises this is the event that gave her the amnesia during her disappearance, and uses the TARDIS to quietly drop her off near the Harrogate Hotel ten days later. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor shows Donna Agatha's novel Death in the Clouds, {{in which there is}} a giant wasp on the cover. The Doctor explains that his copy was printed in the year 5,000,000,000 and that Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, a period free of {{official}} team practices, Young and his receivers spent extra practice time working on their timing and team-work. The fall Orange and White intra-team scrimmage was held on August 21, 2005, as an event open to the public. Running back Ramonce Taylor returned the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. Young completed five of seven passing attempts for 68yards and one touchdown. Senior Richmond McGee made two 33-yard field goals and emerged as the top candidate to handle field goals, kickoffs and punts. Brown said of McGee, [...] "We've never had one person do all three, so it's a concern, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> now, {{he would be the}} guy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a January 2010 {{interview}} while {{promoting his}} biography I Am Ozzy, Osbourne stated {{that although he}} would not rule it out, he was doubtful {{there would be a}} reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: [...] "I'm not gonna say I've written it out forever, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> now I don't think there's any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine." [...] In July, Butler said {{that there would be no}} reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. However, by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn.|$|E

Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was going to shoot a video for eBay, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I probably should have done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E

In Athens 2004, Čavić was leading in a {{semifinal}} of the 100 metre butterfly, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> after his final turn, his suit {{opened at the}} neck and sucked in water, causing Čavić to finish last {{with a time of}} 53.12 seconds. At the 2008 European Championships, Čavić won the men's 50 metre butterfly and was the heavy favorite to win at twice that distance, but was suspended for wearing a [...] "Kosovo is Serbia" [...] T-shirt on the medal podium.

You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out.

500|$|The Heliand, an Old Saxon {{adaptation}} of the New Testament from the 9th century, differs from the New Testament in that an explicit reference is made to a dove sitting {{on the shoulder of}} Christ. Regarding this, G. Ronald Murphy says [...] "In placing the powerful white dove not just above Christ, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> on his shoulder, the Heliand author has portrayed Christ, not only as the Son of the All-Ruler, but also as a new Woden. This deliberate image of Christ triumphantly astride the land with the magnificent bird on his shoulders (the author is perhaps a bit embarrassed that the bird is an unwarlike dove!) is an image intended to calm the fears and longings of those who mourn the loss of Woden and who want to return to the old religion's symbols and ways. With this image, Christ becomes a Germanic god, one into whose ears the Spirit of the Almighty whispers".|$|E

50|$|The peasant class owned land, <b>but</b> <b>rights</b> to tax {{this land}} {{were given to}} the daimyō. Peasants worked to produce enough food for {{themselves}} and still meet the tax burden.

500|$|Despite {{being criticized}} by the opposition, {{especially}} the National Democratic Union, the Unity bloc voted in favor (96 of the 131 MPs) of the austerity measures of the Sargsyan cabinet on 28 August, allowing Armenia to take loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The World Bank alone had loaned almost $0.5 billion to Armenia since 1992 to finance the budget deficits. The Sargsyan cabinet wanted to diversify $32 million in the budget funds {{in order to be}} able to repay the internal debts. For this purpose, the excise tax was raised on cigarettes by 200% and on gasoline by 45%, seriously hitting the middle class. Sargsyan described these as [...] "painful <b>but</b> <b>right</b> steps" [...] for getting the necessary amount of money from the foreign lenders. He pledged a [...] "tougher crackdown on the shadow economy and more efficient governance." [...] National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan called for a greater role of the state in the economy to ensure stability, while President Kocharyan was mostly uninvolved in these developments.|$|E
500|$|Earwigs are hemimetabolous, {{meaning they}} undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, developing {{through a series}} of 4 to 6 molts. The developmental stages between molts are called instars. Earwigs live for about a year from hatching. They start mating in the autumn, and can be found together in the autumn and winter. The male and female will live in a chamber in debris, crevices, or soil [...] deep. After mating, the sperm may remain in the female for months before the eggs are fertilized. From midwinter to early spring, the male will leave, or be driven out by the female. Afterward the female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in 2 days. Some earwigs, those parasitic in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, are viviparous (give birth to live young); they would be fed by a sort of placenta. When first laid, the eggs are white or cream-colored and oval-shaped, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> before hatching they become kidney-shaped and brown. Each egg is approximately [...] tall and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Ricky Gervais {{acknowledged}} {{that there were}} feelings of hesitation from certain viewers. The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics {{with some of them}} comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling which was also based on a British version. The New York Daily News called it [...] "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," [...] and USA Today called it a [...] "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original." [...] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating, [...] "(Steve Carell) just seems to be trying too hard ... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. <b>But</b> <b>right</b> now he's a pale imitation." [...] Tom Shales of the Washington Post said it was [...] "not the mishmash that [...] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out." ...|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... <b>but</b> <b>right</b> now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has {{made it very clear that}} she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this is a guy who has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one.

500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen.

I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years <b>but</b> <b>right</b> now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
