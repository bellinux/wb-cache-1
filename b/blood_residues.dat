40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{detrimental}} effects of anthropogenic pollutants may be worse if organisms are exposed to natural stress. In this study, we examined whether negative effects of organochlorines (OCs) could be influenced by parasites. In two breeding seasons, we administered an anti-helminthic drug to groups of breeding glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), whereas control groups were placebo treated. In all birds, <b>blood</b> <b>residues</b> of the most important OCs in the study population (hexachlorobenzene, oxychlordane, p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and polychlorinated biphenyl), were measured. The relationships between OCs and fitness components (i. e. nesting success and return rate between breeding seasons) were then compared between the birds receiving anti-parasite treatment and the controls. Among untreated males, higher <b>blood</b> <b>residues</b> of OCs were associated with lowered nesting success, while in males receiving anti-parasite treatment, there was no detrimental effect of OCs on fitness. Return rate was not affected by treatment or OCs. Our findings suggest that parasites may be an important factor in triggering reproductive effects of such pollutants, and that relatively low levels of OCs may have serious reproductive consequences in natural populations when stress from other sources is high...|$|E

40|$|Anthropogenic {{and natural}} {{stressors}} can affect ecosystems negatively {{and it is}} therefore {{important to have a}} clear understanding of the responses of organisms to stressors. The Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) is a common raptor species of the boreal forest ecosystem and its location at the top of its food chain makes it a special target for two important stressors; endoparasitism and environmental contaminants. The present study examined potential effects of these two stressors on morphological traits of Northern Goshawk nestlings in Troms County, Norway. A randomly assigned group of nestlings was treated with an anti-helminthic drug while a control group was placebo treated. In all nestlings, <b>blood</b> <b>residues</b> of a set of environmental contaminants were measured. The effects of anti-helminth treatment and contaminant concentrations on the size of morphological traits were assessed using statistical models. Nestlings of the treated group showed increased tail growth while the other morphological traits were unaffected by anti-helminth treatment. Further, no negative effects of the measured contaminant concentrations on morphological traits were found. There was, however, a positive relationship between tail growth and contaminant concentrations which may be interpreted {{as a result of the}} quality or quantity of the diet rather than an effect of contaminants. The findings may either imply that stress due to both helminths and environmental contaminants was rather low in the Northern Goshawk nestlings in the study area or that morphological traits are poor indicators for the stressors investigated...|$|E

30|$|Knee chondropathy {{represents}} {{a challenge for}} the orthopaedic surgeon because of the limited regenerative properties of the cartilage tissue. In the last decades, a variety of treatments, limited only to focal cartilage lesions, has been proposed (Behery et al. 2014; Seo et al. 2011; Tetteh et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2016). For diffuse degenerative chondral lesions, no adequate biological treatments are currently available. New therapeutic approaches, {{such as the use}} of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results when applied in the context of joint degeneration (Caplan 2005; Kristjánsson and Honsawek 2014; Pak et al. 2014, 2016; Ruetze and Richter 2014). MSCs have been reported to have a perivascular origin (pericytes), and to be able to activate and influence the microenvironment by serving as “a site-regulated drug store” (Caplan and Correa 2011). Through trophic, mitogenic, anti-scarring, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory, and anti-microbial actions, produced by a plethora of bioactive elements, growth factors and cytokines, these cells “sense” and “signal” changes in the microenvironment where they reside (Caplan and Correa 2011). Adipose tissue is rich in vascular niches that, besides providing a readily available source of native cushioning, could serve as a smart source of MSCs (Zuk et al. 2002). The use of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) has recently created a huge interest in the context of cartilage regeneration (Pak et al. 2016; Ruetze and Richter 2014), and both in vitro and in vivo studies clearly demonstrated their anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties (Chamberlain et al. 2007). Nevertheless, enzymatic treatment and/or cell expansion have complex regulatory issues (Ährlund-Richter et al. 2009; Arcidiacono et al. 2012; Sensebé et al. 2010). Hence, the availability of a minimally manipulated autologous adipose tissue as a therapeutic option would have remarkable clinical relevance. Based on these considerations, we approached a commercially available system that intra-operatively provides micro-fragmented adipose tissue in a short time, without expansion or enzymatic treatment (Bianchi et al. 2013). With the aid of this technology, the adipose tissue is micro-fragmented and washed until free of pro-inflammatory oil and <b>blood</b> <b>residues.</b> The resulting product has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of different pathologies (Tremolada et al. 2016). The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the 1 -year safety and outcome of a single intra-articular injection of autologous and micro-fragmented adipose tissue in patients affected by diffuse degenerative chondral lesions.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of radiocarbon dating residues from stone artefacts. In the study, the method’s application is examined on artefact samples from archaeological assemblages. While radiocarbon dating of <b>blood</b> <b>residues</b> had been previously reported, dating accuracy required further substantiation. Compromising effects had been described, however the real impact of contamination during sampling steps and analysis protocols remained unclear. Certainly minimizing the quantity of extraneous carbon introduced into samples becomes increasingly significant with small-mass samples. This study has four consecutive aims: (i) to test the practicability of radiocarbon dating plant residues by investigating the impact of contaminant introduction during sample preparation, (ii) to examine contaminants inherent on stone tools and their removal strategies, (iii) to test the feasibility of the method by dating residues from archaeological stone tools with a reference age and (iv) to develop adequate strategies for contaminant prevention to meet future residue dating requirements. Methods used for this study comprised of microscopic residue and use wear analyses, including Scanning Electron Microscope Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) observations. Experimental studies evaluated contaminant cleaning from stone tools and residue extraction methods. Samples were radiocarbon dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). Replicated stone tools were used initially to test techniques. Subsequently, selected artefacts from three archaeological sites were analyzed. Results of this research show significant steps forward in direct residue radiocarbon dating. The feasibility of radiocarbon dating ultra-small samples is suggested if contaminants are confined. For instance, the smallest sample of 10. 5 μgC – extracted wooden residues from iv replicate chert flakes – was dated in agreement with the reference age of ~ 6000 cal BP. Residues dated from an archaeological context showed promising results while emphasizing the crucial impact of contamination for age offsets. Two adhesive residues from one stone tool, which yielded 33. 30 μgC and 44. 38 μgC, were dated within the expected Late Holocene time frame. Wooden residues from a Mesolithic stone tool, containing 18. 97 μgC, were dated successfully, and although deviating ~ 1000 years from the stratigraphical age measurement, the date may still represent the authentic age if taphonomic processes caused tool movement. For the first time {{it has been shown that}} the measurement of residues with such small carbon masses yielded dates in or near agreement to the reference age. This is particularly remarkable when considering the archaeological artefacts initially contained multiple contaminants. Several limitations were overcome by the development of specific sampling and analytical protocols. This will limit common contamination and facilitate accurate artefact residue radiocarbon dating...|$|E

Cumulative methane production curves for the wastes were obtained from the anaerobic batch fermentation having different S/I ratios of 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5. BMP and anaerobic biodegradabilities (Ddeg) of the wastes were calculated from cumulative methane production data for the tested conditions. At the lowest S/I ration of 0. 1, BMPs of piggery <b>blood,</b> intestine <b>residue,</b> and digestive tract content were determined to be 0. 799, 0. 848, and 1. 076 Nm 3 kg− 1 -VSadded, respectively, which were above the theoretical methane potentials of 0. 539, 0. 644, and 0. 517 Nm 3 kg− 1 -VSadded for <b>blood,</b> intestine <b>residue,</b> and digestive tract content, respectively. However, BMPs obtained from the higher S/I ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 were within the theoretical range for all three types of waste and were not significantly different for the different S/I ratios tested. Anaerobic biodegradabilities calculated from BMP data showed a similar tendency.

50|$|From {{evidence}} {{gathered at}} Cuddie Springs according to Judith Field and Richard Fullagerit (as cited in Macey 2003) {{it is known}} that Native Australians inhabited the same habitat as that of Sthenurus and various other extant and extinct species of animal.

While this evidence may suggest that human contact with the Sthenurus and all Australian megafauna could have caused the extinction of these mammals, some studies show the extinction was probably under way before human contact. The Sthenurus were herbivores and when a great climate change began to occur they did not change their eating habits. This probably had a much larger impact on the extinction of this particular genus.|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE Isotope ratio {{analysis}} of bovine tissues {{is a tool}} for inferring aspects of the dietary history of cattle. The objective of this experiment was to quantify the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopic turnover in <b>blood</b> (serum and <b>residue)</b> and inner organs (liver, kidney, heart and brain) of beef cattle. METHODS Growing beef cattle (n[*]=[*] 70 in total) were either switched from a control diet containing barley and urea to an experimental diet containing maize and 15 N-enriched urea, for various intervals prior to slaughter or maintained on the control diet for 168 [*]days pre-slaughter. Samples of blood, liver, kidney, heart and brain were collected at 0, 14, 28, 56, 112 and 168 [*]days and analysed using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. RESULTS After 168 [*]days, C- and N-isotopic equilibrium was reached in the blood serum, liver and kidney, approached in the heart and brain, but not reached in the non-serum component of blood. The estimated C and N half-lives were 16. 5 and 20. 7 [*]days for liver, 19. 2 and 25. 5 [*]days for kidney, 29. 2 and 35. 6 [*]days for blood serum, 37. 6 and 49. 9 [*]days for heart, 53. 3 and 52. 2 [*]days for brain and 113. 3 and 115. 0 [*]days for the non-serum <b>blood</b> <b>residue,</b> respectively. Modelling the C and N turnover in the different tissue combinations revealed that a combined analysis of liver and heart as well as brain and kidney can provide the most accurate estimation of {{the timing of the}} diet switch. CONCLUSIONS Based on the difference in turnover rates, bovine soft tissues can provide isotopic information on short- and long-term dietary changes, which in turn may be linked to the geographic or production origin of beef cattle.

50|$|Evidence of First Peoples {{settlement}} at the Debert Palaeo Indian {{site has}} been found through examination of stone tools that are distinctive to Palaeo-Indian tool kits. Radiocarbon dating has determined that these distinctive stone tools existed approximately 10,600 years ago. Excavations recovered 4500 artifacts over 22 acres of land and found channel flutes that {{were consistent with the}} characteristics of hafted tools present on many Paleo-Indian sites. Channel fluting was a tool constructing method used by the Palaeo-Indians, which involved thinning the base of a tool by removing channel flakes so that stone tools like spear points could be attached to wood or bone shafts. Large stone knives that were possibly used to butcher caribou were also documented as strong evidence for Palaeo-Indian occupation at the Debert site, along with the small pointed or spurred end scrapers unique to the Palaeo-Indians. These end scrapers were likely used to cleanse animal hides.Further archaeological evidence suggests that the site served as a small seasonal hunting camp, possibly re-occupied over several generations. Due to the decomposition of organic materials, stone artifacts that have survived over many decades are recognized as the most frequently documented forms of evidence at the Debert site. Evidence of organic material has also been recovered from <b>blood</b> <b>residue</b> on hunting tools that archaeologists have identified as caribou.|$|R
40|$|Residue {{analyses}} {{on stone}} artefacts {{have contributed to}} resolving functional questions in stone tool research. Although identifying the function of tools through the analysis of their micro-residues is possible, {{the establishment of a}} sound numerical chronology for stone tools lacking a clear stratigraphic sequence, such as surface scatters, remains a challenge. While radiocarbon dating of <b>blood</b> <b>residue</b> on stone artefacts has been published previously (Loy 1987, 1990, 1993; Loy et al., 1990; Nelson et al. 1986), this paper reports on an experiment designed to assess the possibility of directly dating residues on stone artefacts by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) based radiocarbon measurements. Innovative with this approach is (1) the use of mid and late Holocene pre-dated plant material (wood and peat), processed with contemporarily manufactured stone flakes under controlled laboratory conditions and (2) the use of very small carbon masses (less than 22 μg) for radiocarbon dating. The 14 C results of the wood residues are in excellent agreement with the original sample, whereas the 14 C results of the peat residues yield a wider age variation as expected due to the inhomogeneity of the material, but nevertheless, provided dates within an expected age range. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of dating very small amounts of plant residue on lithics directly when contaminants are confined. © 2013, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|Stone {{projectile}} points {{dating back}} 64,000 years were excavated from layers of ancient sediment in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. Examinations found traces of <b>blood</b> and bone <b>residues,</b> and glue {{made from a}} plant-based resin {{that was used to}} fasten them on to a wooden shaft.

40|$|A new {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} analytical method using negative ion chemical ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selective ion monitoring mode {{has been developed}} for the determination of residues of different synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, allethrin, bifenthrin, cypermethrin, cyphonothrin, cyfluthrin, ~. -cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, fenpropathrin, permethrin, prallethrin, and trans-fluthrin, in whole <b>blood.</b> The <b>residues</b> of pyrethrold molecules were extracted from the whole blood using a hexane and acetone (8 : 2, v/v) solvent mixture without separating the serum. The method was found sensitive to detect the residues of pyrethroids up to the level 0. 2 pg/mL. Experiments conducted with the whole blood samples at the fortification level 1 - 100 pg/mL showed 91 - 103 % recovery, whereas blood serum samples collected after the fortification of pyretbroids in whole blood showed 36 - 54 % recovery. Recovery experiments conducted by direct fortification of pyrethroids in blood serum samples showed 96 - 108 %. The applications of the analytical method was tested by analyzing 73 human blood samples collected from the population exposed continuously to different pyrethroid-based formulations. None of the <b>blood</b> samples showed <b>residues</b> of pyrethroids. The results were also confirmed by the detection of the appropriate amounts {{in a number of}} these samples, which had subsequently been spiked with known quantity of pyrethroids...|$|R
