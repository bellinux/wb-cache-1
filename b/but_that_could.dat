Welty, the chief shift nurse on duty that night, who had overheard most of the conversation from the nearby nurses' station, corroborated Churchill's version. She further recalled that Perkins-Graham had said she had only one reservation about transferring to obstetrics—Waters. Churchill, Welty testified, had actually defended Waters, saying she had a difficult job and was sometimes moody, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be accommodated.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, Sweden {{passed a}} {{temporary}} {{law that allows}} the government to oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and is valid until 21 December 2018. The government decided that the new rules will apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The new law led to the mandatory train change and passage though border control at Copenhagen Airport for travellers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency. Sweden introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not stop the migrant flow, since {{they have the right}} to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground.

25|$|India played South Africa in {{the second}} Semi-Final of the tournament on 13 October 2000 at Gymkhana Club Ground, Nairobi, Kenya. India captain, Sourav Ganguly won the toss and decided to bat first. Indian openers gave them a steady start, with 66 for no wicket in 14 overs. Sourav Ganguly scored a {{brilliant}} century scoring 141 runs facing 142 balls he was not out throughout the innings and India scored the mammoth total of 295 runs losing 6 wickets. South African openers could not give their team a good start as both Kirsten and Hall {{were back in the}} pavilion for just the score of 23 in 4 overs and soon they were reduced to 50/4 then Jonty Rhodes, Mark Boucher and Lance Klusener steadied the innings for some extent <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not help too much as they were bowled out for 200 and lost the match by 95 runs.

25|$|The dome's pendentives {{depict the}} Four Evangelists. The {{inscription}} surrounding {{the base of}} the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on that rock I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is {{the same as that of}} St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be a purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads hangs from the middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from Liepāja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{general staff}} and key statesmen, after {{capturing}} the original invasion plans, were initially jubilant {{that they had}} potentially won a key victory in the war before the campaign was even fought. Contrarily, General Gamelin and Lord Gort, {{the commander of the}} BEF, were shaken into realizing that whatever the Germans came up with instead would not be what they had initially expected. More and more Gamelin became convinced that the Germans would try to attempt a breakthrough by concentrating their mechanized forces. They could hardly hope to break the Maginot Line on his right flank or to overcome the allied concentration of forces on the left flank. That only left the centre. But most of the centre was covered by the river Meuse. Tanks were useless in defeating fortified river positions. However at Namur the river made a sharp turn to the east, creating a gap between itself and the river Dyle. This Gembloux Gap, ideal for mechanized warfare, was a very dangerous weak spot. Gamelin decided to concentrate half of his armoured reserves there. Of course the Germans might try to overcome the Meuse position by using infantry. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> only be achieved by massive artillery support, the build-up of which would give Gamelin ample warning.|$|E

500|$|... "Finale" [...] was {{met with}} acclaim from {{television}} critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a highly positive review and called it [...] "a tremendously satisfying conclusion to a show that could make us gasp with laughter, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> also make us cry or smile". Sepinwall noted that, despite the inconsistency {{in the last few}} seasons, [...] "the world was rich enough to fuel a lovely 75-minute trip through the past, present and future of The Office. Ultimately, he noted that the [...] "biggest emotional moments" [...] belonged to Jim and Pam, and their final talking heads. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 9 out of 10, denoting an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. She was highly pleased with the final fifteen minutes, noting that [...] "in those final moments, this series hit every note we could have wanted, without overplaying any of them." [...] She concluded that it [...] "was a strong hour of television [...] the finale shone and delivered on all of its promise." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly praised the entry, writing that [...] "for anyone who's stuck with The Office through thick and thin ... last night's 75-minute-long finale was pretty much perfect." [...] She wrote that [...] "the finale had no shortage of sob-inducing moments", and positively applauded all of the characters' various happy endings.|$|E
500|$|Several {{specific}} episodes received praise. Andrea Reiher of Zap2it named [...] "Dwight Christmas" [...] {{the best}} comedy TV episode of 2012. She {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "was not only funny but had a huge nostalgia factor", and continued the show's trend of strong Christmas episodes. Reiher also praised the episode's two subplots, writing that [...] "drunk Darryl and Die Hard" [...] helped produce [...] "a classic episode of The Office that brought back the warm and fuzzy feelings of the early seasons of the show." [...] The season's penultimate entry, [...] "A.A.R.M.", received a glowing response from many critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode was [...] "surprisingly... terrific in most areas." [...] Roth Cornet of IGN noted that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been {{the core of the}} series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] The series finale, in particular, was praised by critics. Sepinwall called it [...] "a tremendously satisfying conclusion to a show that could make us gasp with laughter, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> also make us cry or smile". Cornet wrote that it [...] "was a strong hour of television [...] the finale shone and delivered on all of its promise." [...] Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that the episode was [...] "just right" [...] for the series. Other episodes were not received as positively. [...] "Lice", for instance, was called [...] "terrible" [...] by Campbell, as well as the [...] "epitome of filler" [...] by Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review. [...] "The Farm" [...] was largely derided due to its uneven nature, and the broad humor that it used.|$|E
