5|$|In {{order to}} suit the modern sensibility, several changes were introduced. Akhtar changed a number of aspects of the climax as he felt the {{original}} ending was outdated for today's audiences. On the other hand, a number of elements from the original were retained in the new film, notably the background score, two songs, some dialogue, and some situations, all of which Akhtar believed were fine in the original, saying that not including them would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|The United States' {{declaration}} of independence from Great Britain in 1776 led criollos (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the American patriots of the Thirteen Colonies waged the American Revolutionary War against both the local loyalists and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government {{in the place of}} the British monarchy. The fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened the idea that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> to end one's allegiance to the parent state.|$|E
5|$|In May 1937, the Committee noted two {{attacks on}} the patrol's ships in the Balearic islands by Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft, the first on the Italian cruiser Barletta and the second on German pocket {{battleship}} Deutschland. It iterated calls for the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain, condemned the bombing of open towns, and showed approval of humanitarian work. Germany and Italy said they would withdrawn from the Committee, and from the patrols, unless it could be guaranteed {{there would be no}} further attacks. Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols. Italian reticence of operations in Spain, however, was dropped. By contrast, it continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> in Germany to mention German operations. Following attacks (attributed to Republicans by Germany, but denied) on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols, but not from the Committee. This prompted the Portuguese government to remove British observers on the SpainPortugal border.|$|E

Given that all Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens as of 1917, this law violated the civil rights of every Puerto Rican.|$|E

Article 376B of the 2013 law made forced sexual intercourse by a man with his wife – if she is living separately – a crime, whether under a decree of separation or otherwise, punishable {{with at least a}} 2-year prison term. Forced sex by a man on his wife may also be considered a prosecutable domestic violence under other sections of Indian Penal code, such as Section 498(A) as well as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. The crime of sexual assault on a child, that is anyone below the age of eighteen, is further outlined and mandatory punishments described in The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012.|$|E

25|$|More than 20 Muslim-majority {{states have}} laws that declare {{apostasy}} by Muslims to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> As of 2014, apostasy was a capital offense in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Executions for religious conversion have been infrequent in recent times, with four cases reported since 1985: one in Sudan in 1985; two in Iran, in 1989 and 1998; {{and one in}} Saudi Arabia in 1992. In Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Yemen apostasy laws {{have been used to}} charge persons for acts other than conversion. In addition, some predominantly Islamic countries without laws specifically addressing apostasy have prosecuted individuals or minorities for apostasy using broadly-defined blasphemy laws. In many nations, the Hisbah doctrine of Islam has traditionally allowed any Muslim to accuse another Muslim or ex-Muslim for beliefs that may harm Islamic society. This principle has been used in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and others to bring blasphemy charges against apostates.|$|E

500|$|In English law, {{trespass}} to land {{involves the}} [...] "unjustifiable interference with land {{which is in the}} immediate and exclusive possession of another". It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, in League Against Cruel Sports v Scott, the courts decided that it could also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident), as in River Wear Commissioners v Adamson. Although previously a pure tort, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which {{trespass to land}} can also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love...

It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> story but to also have a political background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E
