40|$|The {{objective}} of the European Monetary System (EMS) {{is to increase the}} coherence of its member economies and to facilitate the process towards the European Monetary Union. One major element in the process has been the coordinated effort in reducing the volatility of the member currencies through the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). To the same end, the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreement</b> of the European Union (EU) central bankers aims at strengthening the credibility of the EMS through providing credit facilities for intramarginal interventions. In this paper, the impact that the establishment of the EMS and the ratification of the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreement</b> had on the exchange rates of all EU currencies is studied. A multivariate GARCH(1, 1) model is applied to all EU exchange rates in three subperiods: from January 1975 to the establishment of the EMS (March 1979); from March 1979 to the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreement</b> (September 1987); and from September 1987 to October 1991. Comparisons of the estimated parameters are performed across subperiods and between EMS and non-EMS currencies. The characteristics of the estimated conditional variances across subperiods are further examined with nonparametric tests. The findings suggest that the EMS and, especially, the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreement</b> have stabilized the European currencies. ...|$|E
40|$|Daily French and German {{interest}} rate changes since the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreement</b> of September 1987 are examined empirically. In particular, it is {{asked whether the}} shock associated with German unification altered the degree of leadership of German monetary policy in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The paper finds that Germany's leadership role within the ERM largely disappeared in the year following unification but that the Bundesbank began reasserting its predominance thereafter. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{changing}} characteristics of post-war international comovement under fixed and flexible exchange regimes. I find that business cycle comovement {{among all the}} G 7 economies was highest in the universally flexible exchange rate era following the collapse of Bretton Woods (BW) and before the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreement</b> tightened the bands governing the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). With {{the exception of a}} few examples (Canada/US and Germany/France) G 7 business cycles were far less synchronized in the universally fixed exchange rate BW era. More recently the ERM period in which continental Europe maintained fixed exchange rates, is characterized by a high degree of comovement among continental Europe and the English-speaking G 7 countries, with little synchronization across these groups. I find that these changing patterns of comovement were driven by changes in the propagation of shocks rather changes in the relative volatility of shocks themselves across these time periods.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the EMS depends crucially on realignment expectations of the market participants. In this paper we discuss how to measure such expectations and how to relate them to economic fundamentals, central bank reputation, and institutional arrangements of the EMS. We find the following empirical regularities for FF/DM and IL/DM exchange rates: (1) expected devaluations are positively related to the current exchange rate deviation from the central parity; (2) expected devaluations are negatively related {{to the length of}} time since last realignment in the short and medium run; (3) the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>agreements</b> seem to have a stabilizing effect for both currencies examined, albeit through different channels; (4) large revaluation expectations occur immediately after devaluations. (1) and (4) are not inconsistent with the hypothesis of over-speculation or market inefficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Exchange-rate data {{produced}} by the European Monetary System (EMS) contradict important predictions made by the standard target-zone model. We show that the contradictions reflect a misinterpretation of policies pursued by the EMS countries. They intervened intramarginally, to keep exchange rates well within their bands, not {{at the edges of}} the bands, to keep rates from crossing them. In the <b>Basle-Nyborg</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1987, however, they agreed to make fuller use of the band, and exchange rates behave differently thereafter, The effect appears clearly in the behavior of the French franc and less decisively in the behavior of the Italian lira. We conclude by examining and rejecting other explanations for the observed difference in exchange-rate behavior. Governments adhering to the exchange-rate rules of the European Monetary System (EMS) must keep the spot exchange rates for their currencies inside narrow bands. During the period 1979 - 1989, the band for the French franc had a width of 4. 5 % (2. 25 % on each side of its central rate), and the band for the Italian lira had a width of 12 %. Yet the actual rate for the franc remained in a narrower range during most of the period, and the lira was always within a naraower range...|$|E
