50|$|Also, {{in colonial}} times, {{government}} only attempted {{to control the}} outbreak of wildfire by legislating against the careless use of fire, beginning with the 1847 ordinance against reckless burn-offs or stubble and grass. Fire suppression was left to local residents who would band together to fight fires as they arose without any formal organisation or authority to set <b>backburns.</b> In 1913, Councils were given the right to appoint Fire Control Officers, with powers to do anything 'necessary or expedient and practicable' to prevent fires, or to protect life and property {{in the case of}} fire, or to control or extinguish a fire including backburning.|$|R
5000|$|The 2006 Krumbo Butte {{fire started}} out as a wildfire, but several illegal <b>backburns</b> were set by the Hammonds with the intent to protect their winter feed. The backfires were set under the cover of night without warning the {{firefighting}} camp that was known to be on the slopes above. According to the indictment, the fires threatened to trap four BLM firefighters, one of whom later confronted Dwight Hammond at the fire scene after he had moved his crews to avoid the threat. Two days later, according to federal prosecutors, Steven Hammond threatened to frame a BLM employee with arson if he didn't stop the investigation.|$|R
50|$|In {{forestry}} and firefighting, fusees {{are sometimes}} used in wildland fire suppression {{and in the}} ignition of controlled burns. They ignite at 191 C and burn as hot as 1600 C. They are especially effective in igniting burnouts or <b>backburns</b> in very dry conditions, but not so effective when fuel conditions are moist. Since controlled burns are often done during relatively high humidity levels (on {{the grounds that they}} could not be safely contained during periods of very low humidity), the driptorch is more effective and more often used. Fusees are also commonly carried by wildland firefighters for emergency use, to ignite an escape fire in surrounding fuels in case of being overrun by a fire if no other escape routes are available.|$|R
50|$|The {{station and}} {{surrounding}} area were devastated {{by a large}} scale bushfire in 1951. The fire burnt out over 1000 sq mi over a 20 mi front. Station workers had to <b>backburn</b> {{in an attempt to}} control the flames.|$|E

50|$|Bushfires raged {{through the}} area in 2011 with {{approximately}} 50000 ha of grazing lands lost to the flames at Lambina. Lightning strikes initiated the fire which burnt for nearly two weeks before a 40 km <b>backburn</b> helped bring it under control.|$|E
30|$|Burns {{occurred}} at two different locations, {{each of which}} had a different spatial scale. Hereafter, we refer to the first location as the small-scale burns, and the second location as the large-scale burns. Small-scale prescribed burns occurred {{in a set of}} 20 400 m 2 plots established in 2006 in upland shortgrass steppe that had not been grazed by livestock for the previous five years, and remained ungrazed throughout the study period. Four prescribed burn treatments with four replicate plots per treatment were implemented during 2006 to 2013, consisting of: (1) plots burned annually in late March or early April, (2) plots burned annually in October or November, (3) plots burned once every three years in late March or early April, and (4) plots burned once every three years in October or November. Hereafter we refer to these as annual spring, annual fall, triennial spring, and triennial fall burns, respectively. Spring burns occurred prior to any green-up in the dominant grass species, blue grama, and fall burns occurred after complete senescence of aboveground blue grama biomass. For each burn, we established a wet-line on the two downwind boundaries, initiated <b>backburns</b> to create 1 m to 2 m wide blacklines on these boundaries, and then burned the remainder of the plot with a headfire lit with hand-held drip torches from the upwind boundaries. Plant responses to the burns conducted during 2006 to 2007 are reported by Scheintaub et al. (2009). The four plots within a given treatment were always burned on the same afternoon, within a period of approximately two hours. In years in which both annual and triennial burns occurred, all eight plots were burned on the same afternoon. Although annual and triennial burns of the same season occurred under the same weather conditions, they differed in terms of fuel loads and hence were considered separately in analyses. Prior to each burn, fuel loads were measured by harvesting all standing plant biomass within two randomly located 0.25 m 2 quadrats in each plot. Litter, which we define as detached biomass lying on the ground surface, was not measured. During each burn, we measured temperatures of the headfire using six glass-insulated, Omega type-J wire thermocouples over-braided with stainless steel. Thermocouples were placed 1 cm above ground level and attached to dataloggers that recorded temperature at 1 sec intervals (Jacoby et al. 1992). During each burn, we also recorded mean wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature. For analyses, we calculated mean weather parameters, fuel load, and temperature responses across all four replicate burns within a given treatment. No temperatures were recorded in 2006 or 2007, and no data from those burns are included here. During 2008 to 2013, we conducted a total of 60 prescribed burns on these plots under 15 different weather and fuel load conditions.|$|R
50|$|On July 9, Firefighters {{were going}} to <b>backburn</b> parts of I-15, but the winds changed, and the plans were canceled. More crews arrived, {{bringing}} the total personnel from 200 to about 300 firefighters. By {{the end of the}} day, the fire had grown to 311000 acre, but was 10% contained.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{five people}} {{including}} the manager Douglas Lillecrapp were stranded {{at the station}} following heavy rains and subsequent flooding. The property received its average annual rainfall in 30 hours, {{with most of the}} property underwater and flooding through the sheds. Later that year, bushfires raged through the area and approximately 70000 ha of grazing lands were lost to the fire. Lightning strikes initiated the fire which burnt for nearly two weeks before a 40 km <b>backburn</b> helped bring it under control.|$|E
50|$|The big Christmas fire of 1948 saw the Avoca Unit {{going to}} Barnhill Road in a commandeered local bus which {{reportedly}} nearly caught {{fire on the}} day. Unit members, volunteers from the camping area near the bridge and others from the surf club and the beach joined in the fray and headed up to the fire. Roy Parnell, the Captain of the Unit, {{was in charge of}} the <b>backburn</b> in the Barnhill Road / Scenic Highway area and was photographed by the Sydney Morning Herald making the first mention of the Avoca Unit, and later the Brigade, in the press. He was shown on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald with a caption that read “weary firefighter”.|$|E
5000|$|Colonel Moses assumed {{command of}} guerrilla forces in North Luzon on 1 October 1942, and ordered coordinated attacks on Japanese forces {{starting}} on 15 October. Volckmann and <b>Backburn</b> joined Lieutenant Rufino Baldwin, Philippine Army, in {{attacks on the}} Japanese garrisons in the Sanhiglo and Balatoc area. Volckmann then established a new camp in Kiangan, Ifugao on 8 December 1942. Volckmann took command of the two thousand man strong USAFIP-NL, when he was notified on 9 June 1943, of the capture of Colonels Moses and Noble. His orders from Douglas MacArthur's SWPA, were to [...] "...limit hostilities and contact with the enemy to the minimum...your present mission as intelligence units can be of utmost value." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of post—fire microsites on seed and {{seedling}} distribution and hence their potential role in community restoration. A summer wildfire and control burn in a sclerophyll shrubland in mediterranean Australia produced mosaics of physically and chemically contrasting microsites of litter and sand. Most seeds (> 75 %) of all species released from the burnt canopies fell, or were redispersed by wind, into the litter patches after both fires. Data on microsite characteristics and wind exposure (fire intensity), height of fruits, time of release, and seed properties were required to interpret relative distribution between the litter and sand patches. Seeds remained equally viable (up to 100 %) over summer—autumn in the litter and sand and had equally high rates and levels (up to 100 %) of subsequent winter germination. However, seedlings were 2 — 3 times less likely {{to survive in the}} litter and survivors were 35 % smaller than those in the sand {{by the end of the}} first summer. Banksia hookeriana was particularly vulnerable to microsite properties, whereas the needle—leaved Hakea polyathema showed only minor responses. Pre—summer thinning of seedlings in the litter increased survival of the remainder by 2 times and size of the survivors by 31 %. The fire—sensitive, small—seeded B. hookeriana had 17 times more seeds in the <b>backburn</b> litter than the resprouting, larger—seeded B. attenuata, which more than compensated for its 3 times greater seedling mortality levels over the dry summer. Recruitment of species prone to density—dependent mortality in the litter was enhanced by the retention of some seeds in the sand where competition for water was minimal, as indicated by the 2. 2 times greater stomal conductance of their seedlings in early summer...|$|E
