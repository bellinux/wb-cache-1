60|$|The rancho at {{this place}} did not boast even of a roof, but merely {{consisted}} of a ring of thistle-stalks, to break {{the force of the}} wind. It was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake, swarming with wild fowl, among which the <b>black-necked</b> <b>swan</b> was conspicuous.|$|E
60|$|On the pampas the gauchos {{frequently}} {{take the}} <b>black-necked</b> <b>swan</b> by frightening it. When {{the birds are}} feeding or resting on the grass, two or three men or boys on horseback go quietly to leeward of the flock, and when opposite to it suddenly wheel and charge it at full speed, uttering loud shouts, by which the birds are thrown into such terror that they are incapable of flying, and are quickly despatched.|$|E
60|$|As sexual {{selection}} depends on so fluctuating an element as taste, {{we can understand}} how it is that, within {{the same group of}} birds having nearly the same habits, there should exist white or nearly white, as well as black, or nearly black species,--for instance, both white and black cockatoos, storks, ibises, swans, terns, and petrels. Piebald birds likewise sometimes occur in the same groups together with black and white species; for instance, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>swan,</b> certain terns, and the common magpie. That a strong contrast in colour is agreeable to birds, we may conclude by looking through any large collection, for the sexes often differ from each other in the male having the pale parts of a purer white, and the variously coloured dark parts of still darker tints than the female.|$|E
50|$|In Bucalemu's lagoon, it {{is common}} to find <b>black-necked</b> <b>swans.</b> Along its four {{kilometer}} beach, fishing of hakes and crabs (locally known as jaibas) drive the town's economy.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} birds find shelter in the park, {{including}} black-browed albatrosses, great grebes, <b>black-necked</b> <b>swans</b> and cormorants. The wildlife in this area also include Chilean dolphins, sea lions, marine otters and elephant seals.|$|R
50|$|Llancanelo Lake is {{a provincial}} nature reserve. It hosts {{a variety of}} bird species, {{including}} flamingos, <b>black-necked</b> <b>swans,</b> herons and ducks. The lake is also a Ramsar Convention site (RS #759) since 8 November 1995.|$|R
60|$|It {{is not an}} {{exclusively}} British characteristic {{to regard}} the people of other nationalities {{with a certain amount}} of contempt, but with us, perhaps, the feeling is stronger than with others, or else expressed with less reserve. Let me now at last rid myself of this error, which is harmless and perhaps even commendable in those who stay at home, and also very natural, since it is a part of our unreasonable nature to distrust and dislike the things that are far removed and unfamiliar. Let me at last divest myself of these old English spectacles, framed in oak and with lenses of horn, to bury them for ever in this mountain, which for half a century and upwards has looked down on the struggles of a young and feeble people against foreign aggression and domestic foes, and where a few months ago I sang the praises of British civilisation, lamenting that it had been planted here and abundantly watered with blood, only to be plucked up again and cast into the sea. After my rambles in the interior, where I carried about in me only a fading remnant of that old time-honoured superstition to prevent the most perfect sympathy between me and the natives I mixed with, I cannot say that I am of that opinion now. I cannot believe that if this country had been conquered and re-colonised by England, and all that is crooked in it made straight according to our notions, my intercourse with the people would have had the wild, delightful flavour I have found in it. And if that distinctive flavour cannot be had along with the material prosperity resulting from Anglo-Saxon energy, I must breathe the wish that this land may never know such prosperity. I do not wish to be murdered; no man does; yet rather than see the ostrich and deer chased beyond the horizon, the flamingo and <b>black-necked</b> <b>swan</b> slain on the blue lakes, and the herdsman sent to twang his romantic guitar in Hades as a preliminary to security of person, I would prefer to go about prepared at any moment to defend my life against the sudden assaults of the assassin.|$|E

50|$|As Pilling became {{well known}} in the bird {{breeding}} community, he was sought out as a mentor. In 1972, Paul Dye moved to Seattle for the purpose of learning the art and craft of bird breeding from the master. Pilling mentored Dye, and Dye went on to establish his own duck reserve near Lake Stevens, Washington, known as Northwest Waterfowl Farm.In May 2001, Seattle Community Access Network (SCAN) produced a documentary video about Pilling's Pond. It shows green-winged teals, blue-winged teals, wood ducks, mandarins, hooded mergansers, red heads, goldeneye, buffleheads, ring-necks, and northern shovelers, as well as some exotic Siberian geese, <b>black-necked</b> <b>swans</b> and Australian black swans. The pond has been home to over 100 waterfowl in its peak Autumn season. Interviews with Pilling, biologists Peter Lortz and Ellie Cauldwell, and other local pond experts, are also presented in the documentary.|$|R
