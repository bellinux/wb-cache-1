He also played football, was a pitcher on the baseball team, and threw the discus {{in track and field}} competitions. The high school now has a sports complex named after him. His brother Chuck speculated years later that the three Jackson sons threw themselves passionately into athletics {{because it was the only}} time they were allowed to do what other children were doing. Jackson attracted the attention of several baseball scouts.

Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the University of North Dakota in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school.|$|E

Omega stated that he and The Young Bucks were The Elite, but accepted if NJPW continued calling them Bullet Club [...] "in parentheses" [...] as the stable was their [...] "cash cow". He explained the name change by stating that following Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures from NJPW, [...] "Bullet Club [...] so much the Bullet Club anymore", adding that the stable [...] "had all sorts of wrestlers come and go. Some were good, some were bad, some were god-awful", but that [...] "there's a place you can go to watch the most ridiculous and entertaining stuff in pro wrestling, and it's The Elite". Omega later added his opinion that Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures had [...] "watered down" [...] Bullet Club's ranks, which is why he wanted to push The Elite to the forefront, claiming that when people said that [...] "Bullet Club [...] <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> really cool stuff", they always meant him and The Young Bucks and not the other members of the group.|$|E
