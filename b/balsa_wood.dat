5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
50|$|Antiaris toxicaria is {{a fairly}} {{small-scale}} source of timber and yields a lightweight hardwood with density of 250-540 kilogram per cubic metre (similar to <b>balsa).</b> As the <b>wood</b> peels very easily and evenly, {{it is commonly used}} for veneer.|$|R

50|$|The town {{is renowned}} for the {{manufacture}} of wooden masks and puppets. The traditional masks are carved from light <b>Balsa</b> like Kaduru <b>wood</b> (Nux vomica). Kaduru trees grow in the marshy lands bordering paddy fields. The wood is smoke dried for a week in preparation. The hand carved and hand painted masks in traditional dance dramas are both vibrant and colorful. Masks are created for three different types of dancing rituals: 'Kolam', which tell mocking stories of traditional Sri Lankan colonial life; 'Sanni', or devil dancing masks, used in a type of exorcism ceremony to heal people of persisting illnesses believed to be inflicted by demons; and 'Raksha' masks, which are used in festivals and processions. The Naga Raksha (Cobra demon) mask of the 'Raksha Kolama' (demon dance), consists of a ferocious face with bulging, popping & staring eyes, a bloodthirsty carnivorous tongue lolling out of wide mouth armoured and armed to the hilt with set of fanglike teeth, all topped {{by a set of}} cobra hoods.|$|R
5000|$|A {{solution}} to this {{was the creation of}} the Q-ship, one of the most closely guarded secrets of the war. Their codename referred to the vessels' home port, Queenstown, in Ireland. These became known by the Germans as a U-Boot-Falle ("U-boat trap"). A Q-ship would appear to be an easy target, but in fact carried hidden armaments. A typical Q-ship might resemble a tramp steamer sailing alone in an area where a U-boat was reported to be operating. By seeming to be a suitable target for the U-boat's deck gun, a Q-ship might encourage the U-boat captain to make a surface attack rather than use one of his limited number of torpedoes. The Q-ships' cargoes were light <b>wood</b> (<b>balsa</b> or cork) or wooden casks, so that even if torpedoed they would remain afloat, encouraging the U-boat to surface to sink them with a deck gun. The crew might even pretend to [...] "abandon ship". Once the U-boat was vulnerable, the Q-ship's panels would drop to reveal the deck guns, which would immediately open fire. At the same time, the White Ensign (Royal Navy flag) would be raised. With the element of surprise, a U-boat could be quickly overwhelmed.|$|R
25|$|Boron and Graphite rods {{came around}} in the 1960s and 1970s when the United States and United Kingdom {{invested}} considerable research into developing the new technologies. Hewitt and Howald {{were the first to}} come up with a way to lay the fibers into the shape of a fishing rod by wrapping them around a piece of <b>balsa</b> <b>wood.</b> However, by 1977, boron fibre technology had been muscled out by the cheaper material graphite and was no longer competitive in the market.|$|E
25|$|In November they {{demonstrated}} the RP-3, which used welded steel tubing {{in place of}} glue-and-screwed <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> for the framework, and added the new feature of a parachute that could be activated when the flight was over, making landings a simple push-button task. Continued testing was carried out at March Field, east of Los Angeles. These early tests were not very successful, {{but a series of}} improvements were quickly worked into the design. However, at this point the Whittier estate withdrew further funding.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of types differing in the {{construction}} of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot, controls and intended purpose. Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height. Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding, hang gliding and paragliding. However some spacecraft have been designed to descend as gliders and in the past military gliders have been used in warfare. Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as the paper plane and <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> glider.|$|E
25|$|Voris {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California but was raised in Aptos, and later Santa Cruz (where he {{attended}} high school). He briefly considered {{a career as a}} mortician, but instead decided to enroll in Salinas Junior College, receiving his associate degree there in 1939. As a youngster, Voris (whose hobby was building model airplanes out of <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> and tissue paper) was thrilled by the exploits of Eddie Rickenbacker and other World War I aces, and would spend hours watching the big planes come into Mines Field (Los Angeles Airport).|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} wooden sailboat, the hull is {{constructed}} of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often {{referred to as}} ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, <b>balsa</b> <b>wood,</b> impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.|$|E
25|$|The Curtiss-Wright CW-27 was {{designed}} by Curtiss-Wright's chief designer George A. Page, Jr. as a high-wing, twin-engine, cargo transport aircraft, utilizing plywood construction with a tricycle undercarriage. Though the British de Havilland Mosquito had successfully employed a ply construction using a <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> core and birch hardwood exterior, Curtiss-Wright engineers, using research provided by Forest Products Laboratory, rejected this approach, insisting instead on a ply construction of dense mahogany, which greatly increased the plane's weight. At Curtiss' request, Army Materiel Command laid in large supplies of mahogany, {{and a number of}} furniture manufacturers, including the Baldwin Piano Company, were subcontracted to build components for the aircraft, which would be assembled at Curtiss-Wright's new defense plant in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{model of}} Thunderbird 3, whose design {{was based on}} the Soviet Soyuz rocket, was [...] tall. Thunderbird 4 was {{particularly}} difficult to film: as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank, creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective. Thunderbird 5, the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise, {{was based on the}} Tracy Island Round House. Since most of the space station's appearances were provided by stock footage, the model was rarely filmed. Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode-by-episode basis and built from <b>balsa</b> <b>wood,</b> Jelutong wood or fibreglass. To save time and costs, other minor vehicles were built in-house from radio-controlled model kits.|$|E
500|$|The design effort {{produced}} {{a number of}} wooden models. A 24-inch long model, made of <b>balsa</b> <b>wood,</b> demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors. An Air & Space article noted [...] "The model shop found it nearly impossible {{to make all the}} flat surfaces come to a single point in one corner. Engineers later encountered the same difficulty fabricating the prototype on the factory floor." [...] For early tests of the design, two ⅓-scale wooden mock-ups were constructed. One model, coated in metal foil, was used to verify ECHO 1's RCS calculations, while the other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests. Afterwards, a model was moved to the Grey Butte Range radar-testing facility in the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, which allowed more accurate tests of the aircraft's RCS. In the event, the aircraft's RCS level confirmed ECHO 1's predictions. This meant Ben Rich won a quarter from Johnson, who previously insisted that the D-21 had less RCS than Have Blue.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{the final}} scene with the rail ship was {{initially}} delayed because {{it could not be}} hoisted onto the track because of large waves caused by the hurricane. The scene was filmed using 14 cameras, with the rail ship traveling [...] at a time into the set, with debris from the destruction cleared between each take. The mockup was powered by four diesel engines and pulled by a large chain at a speed of [...] The scene's three planned collisions were aided by explosives and hydraulics to ensure the set's structures collapsed precisely. Concrete was also removed from the buildings and replaced with sand-coated <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> so the buildings would [...] "crumble" [...] more effectively after being hit by the rail ship. In the scene's final shot, it had to stop successfully within a [...] area [...] on the first take. The five-minute scene cost $25 million to produce, roughly one quarter of the film's entire budget, and set records as both the largest and the most expensive stunt ever filmed.|$|E
500|$|The M2B was a {{mid-engined}} {{rear-wheel drive}} monocoque design, monocoques having been popularised by Lotus's 25 of 1962. Influenced by his aerospace experience, Herd built the chassis with Mallite, a material that {{had originally been}} designed for internal panelling in aircraft. Mallite is a composite of <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> bonded between two sheets of aluminium alloy that is much stiffer than ordinary aluminium alloy, a useful characteristic for a racing car. However, the material proved {{to be difficult to}} bend into the curved shapes needed and so, whilst the M2A prototype was made entirely of Mallite except for the steel bulkheads, on the M2B it was utilised only for the inner and upper skins, the remainder being aluminium alloy. Mallite was also complicated to repair after crash damage. Its use did mean though that the chassis was the stiffest then built for an open-cockpit car, with torsional rigidity of nearly [...] per degree. Glass-reinforced plastic bodywork covered the nose, cockpit and engine. Fuel was stored in rubber bag tanks situated within the moncoque.|$|E

2500|$|Surfing {{can be done}} {{on various}} equipment, {{including}} surfboards, longboards, Stand Up Paddle boards (SUP's), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to [...] long and [...] ). Lighter <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.|$|E
2500|$|While the C5 {{may have}} been {{initially}} criticized for using inexpensive materials and older technology (e.g., [...] composites in body panels and floor boards; an OHV engine; and leaf springs), ostensibly as cost-cutting measures, these components are actually very strong for their relatively light weight (low mass), or have proven reliability. The C5's modular body panels make excellent use of a lightweight composite material known in the automotive industry as SMC or Sheet Molded Composite, a type of fiberglass that is blended and bonded with plastics. SMC provides better protection against direct blows because it is very stiff and will not dent. The floor boards on the C5 are a composite sandwich of SMC with <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> in the middle. <b>Balsa</b> <b>wood</b> was chosen for its extreme stiffness, light weight and excellent sound absorption qualities. The all aluminium LS1 overhead valve engine is much lighter than its cast iron predecessor, the LT1, and provides for a much lower hoodline when compared to an overhead cam design of relative displacement. The composite leaf springs are much lighter and sit much lower than typical coil springs and help provide the C5 with its excellent ride characteristics and distinctive ride height.|$|E
2500|$|Bossi’s human-powered aircraft, {{named the}} Pedaliante, {{utilized}} conventional glider configuration and construction. The high-winged streamlined monoplane design featured two laminated <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> propellers – each approximately [...] in diameter. The control surfaces {{consisted of a}} conventional rear rudder, elevator, {{and a pair of}} roll spoilers on the wings – all activated by a divided control yoke. The pilot sat semi-upright, and a bicycle chain transmitted the power from the pedals to an overhead transverse shaft that was bevel-geared to the two propellers, which extended from the wing {{on each side of the}} fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 a {{distinctive}} method of exploration was invented. In a dome area [...] above the Big Room floor {{not far from}} the Bottomless Pit, a stalagmite leaned out. Using a <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> loop with helium-filled balloons attached, the explorers, (after several tries over several years), floated a lightweight cord up, over the target stalagmite, and back down to the ground. Then they pulled a climbing rope into position, and the explorers ascended into what they named The Spirit World. [...] A similar, smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor, and was named Balloon Ballroom in honor of this technique.|$|E
2500|$|The Veltro was a wooden, {{shoulder}} wing cantilever monoplane, with a [...] span wing which was straight tapered in plan {{and had an}} aspect ratio of 18:1. [...] Its wing was constructed around a main box spar and a lighter auxiliary spar and was made in three pieces, with a central panel [...] long. [...] The wing was skinned with [...] thick plywood, apart from the tight radius leading edge which was made of carefully shaped <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> glued to a forward false spar. The trailing edges carried fabric covered slotted ailerons outboard and ply covered slotted flaps which at low deflection angles acted as camber changing, lift increasing devices {{to increase the speed}} range and at higher angles (>60°) acted as airbrakes. [...] The wing tips were fitted with tip bodies [...] long and [...] in diameter.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, {{the cargo}} was {{salvaged}} by the islanders {{for their own}} use. The Blue Star brand canned chicken was spoken highly of by the islanders.

In August 1967, a local boy drowned while exploring the wreck of Francisco Morazan. In August 1968, Attorney General Frank Kelley filed a lawsuit to have {{the wreck of the}} ship removed. He claimed that the rotting cargo was a health hazard and the [...] of fuel oil posed a pollution risk. The following day, Francisco Morazan was found to be on fire and the cargo was entirely consumed. Two of the three defendants in the lawsuit disappeared and the lawsuit was later dropped. The wreck of Francisco Morazan is now the property of the State of Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|The Dayton-Wright RB-1 (Rinehart-Bauman model one), {{also known}} simply as the Dayton-Wright Racer was a racing {{aircraft}} developed in the United States {{to participate in the}} 1920 Gordon Bennett Cup air race. Advanced for its day, the aircraft was a high-wing monoplane with a monocoque fuselage and cantilever wing (built of solid <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> covered in plywood and linen that incorporated a Grant designed mechanism to vary its camber in flight by moving the leading edge and trailing edge. [...] The aircraft also featured a retractable undercarriage operated by a hand-crank {{making it one of the}} first instances of undercarriage retraction for aerodynamic benefit alone. The propeller shaft was mounted through a large oval radiator, the pilot had no forward view, but was provided with flexible celluloid side windows. [...] Cockpit access was through a hatch in the top of the fuselage. A prototype was built using non-retractable gear and strut-braced wings. A shorter tapered [...] "racing wing" [...] was installed afterward with leading and trailing edge flaps interconnected with landing gear deployment. The mechanisms and hinges for the wing flaps were exposed across the top of the solid wing. The racing wing produced directional instability requiring small tail fins to be added.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{building}} was considered excessively large. The Guardian described it in 1978 as [...] "an awful warning against thinking too big in Britain's cities", and [...] "so castle-like in its outer strength that any passing medieval army would automatically besiege {{it rather than}} shop in it...". The underground railway scheme was abandoned by 1976 and the only deck access was across Corporation Street to another Town &City development in the Shambles. At the official opening, one of its champions, Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, Mayor of Manchester, commented, [...] "I didn't think {{it would look like}} that when I saw the <b>balsa</b> <b>wood</b> models". [...] The [...] "unrepentant" [...] architects responded that they had provided what they had been asked to provide. Kenneth Stone said in 1978 [...] "We're not responsible for everything in there, but we're not sorry about the decisions we took as opposed to those which were forced upon us." [...] The critics' opinion did not mellow with time, and it was described as [...] "aggressive externally" [...] in 1991. The Economist noted in 1996 that it had [...] "long been regarded as one of Europe's ugliest shopping centres.... the epitome of lousy modern architecture... was hated". The Financial Times in 1997 called it [...] "outstandingly ugly" [...] and in 2000 [...] "one of Britain's least-loved buildings".|$|E
