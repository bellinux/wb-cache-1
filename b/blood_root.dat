The rete mirabile is a capillary network which {{is involved in the}} gas secretion into the bladder. The rete is regarded as a counter-current multiplier. Lactic acid which is produced in the gas gland generates in the rete single concentrating effects for oxygen and carbon dioxide; i. e., for equal partial pressures the concentrations of the gases in the afferent rete capillaries are higher than those in the efferent ones. The single concentrating effects were calculated from measurements of sea robin <b>blood</b> (<b>Root,</b> 1931). The multiplication of these effects within the rete for different rete lengths and different transport rates was numerically evaluated. The calculated O 2 and CO 2 pressures in the bladder are in good agreement with the experimental results of Scholander and van Dam (1953). The descent velocities at equilibrium between bladder pressure and hydrostatic pressure are discussed for fishes with different rete lengths...|$|E

This decline has been caused by increased human development in natural areas and the replacement of native plants with exotic, non-native plants. As a result, a generation has grown up not knowing what an Ozark wake Robin trillium (Trillium pusillum var. ozarkanum) or <b>Blood</b> <b>root</b> (Sanguinaria canadensis) Look like, because these plants are difficult to find in nature, are not commonly grown in designed landscapes, and are Largely unavailable in garden centers.

A proposed solution focuses on restoring the region 2 ̆ 7 s landscape identity by landscaping with native plants. The benefits of native plants include the following: the creation of native habitats, an increase in biodiversity, the conservation of natural resources, a reduction in long-term landscape costs and a decrease in landscape maintenance requirements and costs. Interviews with regional suppliers and users of native plants identified sources of information and methods of growing these plants. As a result, guidelines on how to incorporate native plants into designed landscapes were developed and are presented with a listing of native plant experts and nurseries, a partial listing of plants for Northwest Arkansas (organized by site conditions), a suggested reading and reference list, and a listing of public gardens that emphasize native plant...|$|E

Forty single-canal teeth scheduled for extraction were selected. Access cavity was prepared and coronal enlargement was carried out. Approximately two drops of blood were collected by finger prick and injected into the root canal space. The electronic working length (EWL) of each tooth by each device was established twice before (NB group) and after (WB group) injecting <b>blood</b> into the <b>root</b> canal. The tooth was extracted and the actual working length (AWL) was determined. Data were analyzed using McNemar's test. The accuracy rates of Raypex 5 and Root ZX within 0. 5 mm in the NB group were 88. 9 % and 91. 5 %, with 83. 3 % and 86. 2 % in the WB group, respectively. There were no significant differences between the accuracy of each EFL in the two groups (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Boundaries of belonging: {{transnational}} {{adoption and}} {{the significance of}} origin in Swedish official rhetoric This article explores how the category of ‘transnational adoptees’ in Sweden is constructed in two Official Government Reports (SOU). The article is inspired by poststructuralist perspectives on welfare and social categorization, and draws from a postcolonial and feminist theoretical framework. ‘Transnational adoptees’ as a category is understood as constituted through discourse, and given meaning in different contexts. In the reports, a fundamental importance {{is attached to the}} fact that individuals with a background as transnationally adopted have been separated from their birth family and country of birth. It is argued that mental problems and a split identity are consequences to be expected from the separation. (Re) connection to the origin is therefore considered to be crucial for the well-being of the group. The article concludes that this line of reasoning is based on a specific logic of <b>blood</b> and <b>roots,</b> in which ‘transnational adoptees’ are understood as belonging to their countries of birth, rather than Sweden. The logic of <b>blood</b> and <b>roots</b> can be read as a form of racialized othering, but also as a discursive exclusion of ‘transnational adoptees’ from Sweden as an imagined, national community.

40|$|Data on 386 {{species with}} fire-stimulated {{flowering}} (fsf) in Australasia and South Africa/Madagascar were collated {{to show that}} they occur under a wide range of fire regimes, with 71 % confined to the mediterranean-climate regions. About 40 % only flower up to 2 years after fire (obligate), while the rest continue at a low rate until the next fire (facultative). Peak flowering occurs 5 - 18 months after fire in the mediterranean regions but at 1 - 7 months in savannas. Fsf is recorded in 34 families, headed by terrestrial orchids (45 % of species), spread throughout the seed-plant phylogeny from cycads to daisies. Tuberous geophytes (essentially orchids) dominate (51 %), but other resprouting growth forms include lignotuberous shrubs and forbs, rhizomatous and bunch grasses, leaf succulents, grasstrees, epicormic trees, and hemiparasites. Most have wind-dispersed diaspores (72 %), store their diaspores in the soil (93 %), and seeds that do not germinate until the next fire (72 %). Fsf in association with resprouting takes advantage of optimal resources and minimal competition for growth and reproduction, conditions that favor wind dispersal and maximize the interval for seed accumulation before the next fire and build-up of fire-tolerant organs. Reduced herbivory has little role in accounting for its benefits. The proximal causes of fsf center around cueing factors (direct effects such as ethylene), resource factors (direct and indirect effects, e. g., extra nutrients), and predisposing factors (circumstantial effects, e. g., fire interval). The evolutionary history of fsf has been explored recently in orchids, proteas, <b>blood</b> <b>roots,</b> droseras, and mistletoes and shown to stretch back over a period of at least 50 million years, indicating that flowering in many groups has a long association with fire as an agent of natural selection...|$|R

This in vitro study aimed to compare the sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and a new endodontic cement named calcium enriched mixture (CEM) cement as root-end filling materials. Materials and Methods: The experiments were carried out in dry, saliva or blood contaminated root-end cavities of hundred single-rooted extracted human teeth. After decoronation, the root canals were cleaned, shaped, obturated, and stored in 100 % humidity for 5 days. Removing the apical 2 - 3 mm of each root, a 3 mm deep root-end cavity was ultrasonically prepared. Samples were randomly divided into 2 test groups of 45 roots/experimental material, and one subgroup (n= 15) for each environmental condition as follows; a) dried before placing the filling material, b) filled after contamination with saliva, and c) filled after contamination with <b>blood.</b> Ten <b>roots</b> were used as positive/negative controls. Samples were placed in an incubator at 37 °C for a day and immersed in methylene blue dye under reduced pressure environment for 48 hours.

Subjecting a tooth to torque could have potential root resorbing side effects [13],[14]. In a study by Hohmann et al., it was observed that torque applied to a tooth causes root resorption and that such resorption could be predicted using finite element analysis. In their study they opted to use hydrostatic pressure and concluded that when hydrostatic pressure surpassed 0.0047  MPa, the value corresponding to capillary <b>blood</b> pressure, <b>root</b> resorption occurs. We therefore calculated the hydrostatic pressure defined as S 1 [*]+[*]S 2 [*]+[*]S 3 / 3, for the different vertical positions of the brackets to assess the probability of root resorption. The hydrostatic pressure values obtained from our study are much greater than those observed by Hohmann et al. when they subjected the tooth to 3 and 6 Nmm of torque. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that wire engagement in our study resulted in higher torque forces, the minimum of which was 9.59 Nmm with the bracket positioned 5  mm from the cusp tip. It has been claimed that torquing force of 5 – 20 Nmm is acceptable clinically [27], and based on the results of the present study, bonding the bracket just 1  mm more gingivally than the 5  mm point could result in torquing forces exceeding the mentioned amount. As demonstrated by Hohmann et al. and several other authors, significantly more root resorption occurs by increasing the torque exerted on the tooth [13]–[15].|$|R
