25|$|The {{birthday}} {{problem in}} this more generic sense applies to hash functions: the expected number of N-bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2N, but rather only 2N/2.

We {{propose a}} new {{construction}} for Merkle authentication trees {{which does not}} require collision resistant hash functions; in con-trast with previous constructions that attempted to avoid the depen-dency on collision resistance, our technique enjoys provable security as-suming the well-understood notion of second-preimage resistance.

5000|$|A <b>birthday</b> <b>attack</b> {{is a type}} of {{cryptographic}} {{attack that}} exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory. This attack can be used to abuse communication between two or more parties. The attack depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts and a fixed degree of permutations (pigeonholes). With a <b>birthday</b> <b>attack,</b> it is possible to find a collision of a hash function in [...] = 2n/2, with 2n being the classical preimage resistance security. There is a general (though disputed) result that quantum computers can perform birthday attacks, thus breaking collision resistance, in [...] = 2n/3.|$|E

30|$|In essence, the pre-image {{resistance}} is {{to match the}} hash size. The collision {{resistance is}} to match the inherent birthday problem’s {{one half of the}} hash size. pre-image resistance alludes to hash being one way, given a specific message M, it’s computationally infeasible to derive M or any of its peers (collisions, if M is bigger than H) from H(M). Collision resistance is the same definition with the word “specific” changed to “arbitrary”. From a practical point of view, the only difference between the two is that <b>birthday</b> <b>attacks</b> can be applied to finding collisions, but not to pre-images.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} hash size is big enough. According to the <b>birthday</b> <b>attack</b> {{a security}} level of 280 (generally {{assumed to be}} infeasible to compute today) is desirable thus the hash size {{should be at least}} 160 bits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{improvements to the}} techniques used to cryptanalyze SHA- 0 and introduce the first results on SHA- 1. The results include a generic multi-block technique that uses nearcollisions {{in order to find}} collisions, and a four-block collision of SHA- 0 found using this technique with complexity 2 51. Then, extension of this and prior techniques are presented, that allow us to find collisions of reduced versions of SHA- 1. We give collisions of variants with up to 40 rounds, and show the complexities of longer variants. These techniques show that collisions up to about 53 – 58 rounds can still be found faster than by <b>birthday</b> <b>attacks.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{parallel}} Hash algorithm construction based on chaotic maps with variable parameters is proposed and analyzed.

Moreover in this paper, an algorithm for one way hash function construction based on chaos theory is introduced. The proposed algorithm contains variable parameters dynamically obtained from the position index of the corresponding message blocks. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation indicate that the algorithm can assure all performance requirements of hash function in an efficient and flexible style and secure against <b>birthday</b> <b>attacks</b> or meet-in-the-middle attacks, which is good choice for data integrity or authentication...|$|R

5000|$|Collision resistance: {{it should}} {{be hard to find}} two {{different}} messages [...] and [...] such that [...] Such a pair is called a (cryptographic) hash collision.

5000|$|It {{should be}} {{difficult}} to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision.

30|$|Collision {{resistance}} and <b>birthday</b> <b>attacks</b> {{are similar in}} idea. Both are originated from the probability problem that two random input data are found to hash to the same value. In the proposed scheme, {{the state of the}} chaotic map is directly related to each message bit. Also, the control parameters and the initial conditions of the chaotic map are fully affected by the message bits. These operations will ensure that each bit of the final hash value is related to all the bits of the message. Therefore, even 1 -bit change in the message would lead to a completely different hash code. Moreover, the initial conditions and the control parameters of the chaotic map are related to the message and the state of the map, so the keyed hash function is so much sensitive to the keys.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On October 2 -nd 2012 NIST {{announced}} its {{selection of the}} Keccak scheme as the new SHA- 3 hash standard.
