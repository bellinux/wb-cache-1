5000|$|During {{the ascent}} phase, 73 seconds after liftoff, the vehicle {{experienced}} a catastrophic structural failure {{resulting in the}} loss of crew and vehicle. The Rogers Commission later determined the cause of the accident to have been the failure of the primary and secondary (backup) O-ring seals on Challengers right Solid Rocket Booster. The failure of these seals allowed a flamethrower-like flare to impinge upon one of two aft SRB attach struts, which eventually failed, freeing the booster to pivot about its remaining attachment points. The forward part of the <b>booster</b> <b>cylinder</b> struck the external tank inter-tank area, leading to a structural failure of the ET — the core structural component of the entire stack. A rapid burning of liberated propellants ensued. With the structural [...] "backbone" [...] of the stack compromised and breaking up, the SRBs flew off on their own, as did the orbiter, which rapidly disintegrated due to overwhelming aerodynamic forces. The launch had been approved despite a predicted ambient temperature of 26 F, well below the qualification limit of major components such as the SRBs, which had been certified for use only at temperatures above 40 F. Evidence found in the remnants of the crew cabin showed that several of the emergency air supplies (PEAPs) carried by the astronauts had been manually activated, suggesting that forces experienced inside the cabin during breakup of the orbiter were not inherently fatal, and that at least three crew members were alive and capable of conscious action for some period of time following vehicle breakup. [...] "Tracking reported that the vehicle had exploded and impacted the water in an area approximately located at 28.64 degrees north, 80.28 degrees west" ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{surveys the}} {{various aspects of}} design and {{overhaul}} of the solid rocket boosters. It is noted that quality control {{is an integral part}} of the design specifications. Attention is given to the production process which is optimized towards highest quality. Also discussed is the role of the DCA (Defense Contract Administration) in inspecting the products of subcontractors, noting that the USAF performs this role for prime contractors. Fabrication and construction of the booster is detailed with attention given to the lining of the <b>booster</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the mixing of the propellant and the subsequent X-ray inspection...|$|E
50|$|As an {{improvement}} to Pars, the 16V utilizes solid disc brakes on rear wheels, {{but unlike the}} ELX which is equipped with an advanced ABS/EBD, the 16V model uses the same vacuum <b>booster,</b> master <b>cylinder,</b> distributor, and hydraulic lines as the standard Pars.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Because of the Limitations and {{shortcomings}} of the traditional multi-disciplinary optimization methods, this paper presents a useful optimal method named Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) for braking system characteristics optimization. The deceleration and pedal sense are chosen as the design targets. Brake system is divided into 4 subsystems: pedal, vacuum <b>booster,</b> master <b>cylinder,</b> brake. The optimization results show that ATC has {{a high degree of}} accuracy. Introduction. A good pedal sense and braking deceleration is important for braking system design [1, 2]. Sometimes, traditional multi-disciplinary optimization methods have limitations and shortcomings in convergence and decoupling, so Analytical Target Cascading is proposed as a ne...|$|R
25|$|In Australia, Victorian Railways {{equipped}} {{all but one}} of its X class 2-8-2 locomotives (built between 1929 and 1947) with a 'Franklin' two <b>cylinder</b> <b>booster</b> engine {{after the}} successful trial of the device on a smaller N class 2-8-2 in 1927. The South Australian Railways 500 class 4-8-2 heavy passenger locomotives were rebuilt into 4-8-4s {{with the addition of a}} booster truck from 1929 onwards.|$|R
40|$|Brake-by-wire {{represents}} {{the replacement of}} traditional brake components such as pumps, hoses, fluids, brake <b>boosters,</b> and master <b>cylinders</b> by electronic sensors and actuators. The different design of these brake concepts poses new challenges for the automotive industry with regard to availability and fallback levels in comparison to standard conventional brake systems. This contribution focuses {{on the development of}} appropriate fallback level concepts. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) techniques and field trials will be used to investigate the performance and the usability of such systems...|$|R
40|$|NoBraking system characteristics, {{brake system}} {{performance}} and {{brake system component}} design parameters that influence brake pedal `feel¿ in a passenger car have been studied using the simulation modelling package AMESim, in particular to model the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components. A passenger car hydraulic brake system simulation model incorporating the brake pedal, <b>booster,</b> master <b>cylinder,</b> brake lines and calipers has been developed to predict brake system response {{to assist in the}} design of braking systems with the desired brake pedal force / travel characteristic characteristics to create good brake pedal `feel¿. This has highlighted the importance of system components, in particular the master cylinder and caliper seal deformation, and the operating characteristics of the booster in determining the brake pedal force / travel characteristic. The potential contribution of these 3 components to brake pedal `feel¿ improvement has been investigated, and the results of the AMESim model have been verified using experimental measurement data. The model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of brake system response at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R
50|$|The {{last five}} Maine Central Pacifics were built with <b>booster</b> engines. Increasing <b>cylinder</b> {{diameter}} to 24 in increased tractive effort to 36500 lbf kN or 46800 lbf kN with the booster. Enlarged tenders held 13 tons of coal and 9100 gal of water. Builders numbers 57885 through 57887 were delivered in 1917 with weight increased to 268300 lb. Building of new 4-6-2s {{was interrupted by}} World War I when the United States Railroad Administration (USRA) authorized construction of non-standard class O 4-6-0s because Maine Central Pacifics were so much smaller than USRA Light Pacifics. The final two class C engines were builders numbers 65554 and 65555 delivered in 1924. Number 470 was preserved in Waterville, Maine after pulling the last Maine Central steam-powered train on 13 June 1954.|$|R
40|$|Similar to the {{fly-by-wire}} {{technology in}} aerospace industry, drive-by-wire technology in automotive industry replaces the traditional mechanical and hydraulic systems with mechatronic actuation and control and human-machine interfaces (such as pedals and steering wheels) with emulators. Brake-by-wire in particular, represents {{the replacement of}} traditional components such as the pumps, hoses, fluids, belts and brake <b>boosters</b> and master <b>cylinders</b> with electronic sensors and actuators. Some x-by-wire technologies have been already installed on commercial vehicles such as steer-bywire, and throttle-by-wire. Due to its safety-critical nature, the brake-by-wire technology is still under an intensive research and development by some automobile and automotive parts manufacturers worldwide {{and has not been}} widely commercialized yet. This paper surveys some recent patents that suggest techniques to solve two challenging problems in brake-by-wire systems. The first problem involves reliable measurement of the driver&# 039;s brake demand using a multisensor brake pedal mechanism and handling its missing data samples...|$|R
