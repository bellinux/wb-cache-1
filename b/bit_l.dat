30|$|The {{bit rate}} is {{determined}} through three steps. The module of Huffman coding is kept {{to calculate the}} saving bits and prepare for the bit allocation. Let Sum be the total bits at a fixed bit rate. Firstly, the norms are coded by both the original Huffman coding consuming h 1 bits and the context-based adaptive arithmetic coding consuming a 1 bits simultaneously. Compared to the Huffman coding, the context-based adaptive arithmetic coding can save <b>bits</b> <b>L</b> 1 = h 1 − a 1. The remaining bits num 1 = Sum − h 1 are used for bit allocation of the quantized MDCT coefficients. In the second step, the subbands with different bits assigned by the bit allocation are encoded by the proposed adaptive arithmetic coding. The quantized MDCT coefficients are also encoded by Huffman coding consuming h 2 bits to calculate the remaining bits num 2 = Sum − h 1 − h 2 used for the noise level adjustment. Compared to the Huffman coding, the number of bits used for coding the quantized MDCT coefficients with the context-based adaptive arithmetic coding is a 2, which can save <b>bits</b> <b>L</b> 2 = h 2 − a 2. Finally, the noise level is adjusted according to num 2. The total bits and the bits used for the bit allocation and noise level adjustment in the improved encoder remain {{the same as those}} in the primary fixed rate G. 719; hence, the saving <b>bits</b> <b>L</b> 1 + L 2 (provided by the context-based adaptive arithmetic coding compared to the original Huffman coding) lead to the variable rate of G. 719. To ensure the correct decoding, the header in G. 719 [7] which specifies the number of bits used for encoding is changed to indicate variable bits instead of fixed bits.|$|R

An encoding scheme based on fixed-length block codes with erasures is used to establish inner bounds to the achievable performance for finite expected decoding time. A new technique for bounding the performance of variable-length block codes is used to establish outer bounds to the performance for a given expected decoding time. The inner and the outer bounds match one another asymptotically and characterize the achievable region of rate-exponent vectors, completely. The single-message message-wise {{unequal error protection}} problem for variable-length block codes with feedback is also solved as a necessary step on the way. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

40|$|McEliece {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known public key cryptosystems, however it was not quite as {{successful}} as RSA. One main reason is that it is widely believed that code-based cryptosystems like McEliece do not allow practical digital signatures. Although X. M. Wang presented a code-based signature scheme in 1990, some authors find that it is not secure. Recently, T. Courtois et al. show a new way to build a practical signature scheme based on coding theory (simply, Courtois et al. s scheme). The security is reduced to the well-known syndrome decoding problem and the distinguishability of permuted binary Goppa codes from a random code. This shows that error correct codes can be used to construct some other cryptosystems. In this paper, we present, for the first time, a code-based ring signature scheme with signature length of 144 + 126 <b>l</b> <b>bits</b> (<b>l</b> is the number of ring members), which {{is one of the}} most short ring signature among all the presented ring signature schemes up to now...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the N-user broadcast erasure channel with unicast sessions (one for each user) where receiver feedback is regularly {{sent to the}} transmitter {{in the form of}} ACK/NACK messages. We first provide a generic outer bound to the capacity of this system; we then propose a virtual-queue-based inter-session mixing coding algorithm, determine its rate region, and show that it achieves capacity under certain conditions on channel statistics, assuming that instantaneous feedback is known to all users. Removing this assumption results in a rate region that asymptotically differs from the outer bound by 1 <b>bit</b> as <b>L</b> -> infinity, where L is the number of bits per packet (packet length). For the case of arbitrary channel statistics, we present a modification of the previous algorithm whose rate region is identical to the outer bound for N = 3, when instant feedback is known to all users, and differs from the bound by 1 <b>bit</b> as <b>L</b> ->infinity, when the three users know only their own ACK.

40|$|For {{many kinds}} of prefix-free codes there are {{efficient}} and compact alternatives to the traditional tree-based representation. Since these put the codes into canonical form, however, they can only be used when we can choose {{the order in which}} codewords are assigned to characters. In this paper we first show how, given a probability distribution over an alphabet of σ characters, we can store a nearly optimal alphabetic prefix-free code in o (σ) bits such that we can encode and decode any character in constant time. We then consider a kind of code introduced recently to reduce the space usage of wavelet matrices (Claude, Navarro, and Ordóñez, Information Systems, 2015). They showed how to build an optimal prefix-free code such that the codewords' lengths are non-decreasing when they are arranged such that their reverses are in lexicographic order. We show how to store such a code in O (σ L + 2 ^ϵ <b>L)</b> <b>bits,</b> where <b>L</b> is the maximum codeword length and ϵ is any positive constant, such that we can encode and decode any character in constant time under reasonable assumptions.
