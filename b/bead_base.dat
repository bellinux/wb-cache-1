40|$|Thin {{organic and}} polymer layers on solid {{substrates}} {{play a key}} role in many processes aimed at modifying surface properties. Both "grafting to" and "grafting from" methods have been used in this project to modify a variety of surfaces including cellulose, resins and carbon nanotubes (CNT) with functional polymers. Living radical polymerisation and Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition (often termed "click" reaction) were used to carry out these modifications. Living radical polymerisation was first used to synthesize different α-functional polymers and used for surface modification. For example, Living radical polymerisations of methyl methacrylate and a fluorescent comonomer with 2 -bromo- 2 -methyl-propionic acid 3 -azido-propyl ester and 2 -bromo- 2 -methyl-hept- 6 -yn- 3 -one as initiators have been successfully employed for the synthesis of fluorescently tagged azide and alkyne terminated PMMA with molecular weight (Mn) close to that predicted and polydispersity index (PDi) less than 1. 20 and good first order kinetics that would be expected for living radical polymerisation. Cotton and organic resin surfaces have been functionalised with alkyne groups using simple condensation with 4 -chlorocarbonyl-butyric acid prop- 2 -ynyl ester. The surfaces have been further modifies using a Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition (click) reaction of both polymeric and small molecule azides. Different functional azides, namely mono azido-PEG and a new fluorescent hostasol derivative have also been prepared and tested as model substrates for cotton surface modification. This approach is shown to be very general allowing soft and hard surfaces with different geometries to be modified. In particular it is an excellent method to alter the nature of organic resins allowing the incorporation of many different functionalities. The covalent immobilization of a range of carbohydrate derivatives onto resin beads was then carried out. Copper-catalysed Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition was used to graft mannose-containing azides to complementarily functionalised alkyne surfaces, namely: a) Wang resin or b) "Rasta" particles consisting of a "clickable" alkyne polymer loose outer shell and a Wang resin inner core. For the second approach, Wang resin beads were first converted into immobilized ATRP initiators, and then polymerisation of trimethylsilanyl-protected propargyl methacrylate followed by deprotection with TBAF· 3 H 2 O afforded the desired polyalkyne clickable scaffold. An appropriated α-mannopyranoside azide was then clicked onto it, to give a mannose functionalized "Rasta" resin. The binding abilities of these D-mannose-modified particles were then tested using fluorescein labelled Concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin known for its ability of binding certain mannose-containing molecules. Our preliminary results indicated that the novel glycohybrid materials presented in this work are able to efficiently recognize mannose-binding model lectins such as Con A, opening the way for their potential application in affinity chromatography, sensors and other protein recognition/separation fields. Other functional polymers with antibiotic or chiral properties were also grafted from surfaces. Living radical polymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and a metronidazole monomer (MTD-MA) has been successfully employed for the synthesis of antibiotic metronidazole containing polymers with Mn close to that predicted, narrow polydispersity and good first order kinetics that would be expected for living radical polymerisation. Using the monomers PEGMA and MTD-MA, with preformed immobilized initiator on cotton, surface initiated LRP was carried out to give cotton bearing antibiotic polymers. Surface initiated living radical polymerisation of GMA was then successfully carried out for the synthesis of PGMA containing <b>bead</b> <b>base</b> on Aquagel resin. The hydroxyl groups of the PGMA moiety were then reacted with a single enantiomer (R) -(+) - 1 - phenylethyl isocyanate (EtPhNCO). This demonstrates a convenient way of immobilise enantiomer moiety onto resin surface and the resulting solid support may be used as chiral stationary phases (CSP) for HPLC chromatography. To modify CNTs with functional polymers not only increase the dispersability of the CNTs, it has also enlarged the application areas of CNT’s due to the polymers' own functional properties. MWCNTs were first converted to a solid support LRP initiator by an esterification reaction and styrene was grafted from MWCNTs through surfaceinitiated LRP, the PSt modified CNTs were then used to form isoporous membranes. Similarly, Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrons were covalently attached to MWCNTs and dendron-MWCNT-Ag(0) hybrid materials were made afterwards which occurred via Ag(I) coordination to the PAMAM dendron nitrogen donors, followed by reduction with formaldehyde. Finally, noncovalent method was used to make a thermo-sensitive water soluble CNTs. The homopolymerisations and copolymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA) using a pyrene-containing initiator and a Cu(0) /Me 6 -Tren catalyst system was investigated. The pyrenefunctionalised polymers synthesised were then used to modify CNTs and thus thermosensitive water-dispersible CNTs were made.

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} {{performed}} to evaluate the kinetics and equilibrium binding constants of biomolecules in nanofluidic channels. Binding events in the nanochannel were detected using electrical and fluorescence methods. We concluded that antibody-antigen binding constants in nanochannels were similar to experiments performed in microtiter plates at low antigen concentrations; however the bound fraction in nanochannels at high antigen concentration decreased due to steric hindrance. Binding kinetics in nanochannels was limited by convective transport of analytes, instead of diffusion or reaction. We also found that enzymatic reactions in nanochannels were very effective due to short diffusion length and high surface area to volume ratio. A <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> ELISA was developed to exploit the rapid binding reactions in the bulk and efficient enzymatic conversion in the nanochannels.

A critical requirement for these applications is the generation of a stable linkage between the solid support and the immobilized, but still functional, protein. METHODOLOGY: Solid supports including crosslinked polymer beads, beaded agarose, and planar glass surfaces, were modified to present an oligoglycine motif to solution. A range of proteins were ligated to the various surfaces using the Sortase A enzyme of S. aureus. Reactions were carried out in aqueous buffer conditions at room temperature for times between one and twelve hours. CONCLUSIONS: The Sortase A transpeptidase of S. aureus provides a general, robust, and gentle approach to the selective covalent immobilization of proteins on three very different solid supports. The proteins remain functional and accessible to solution. Sortase mediated ligation is therefore a straightforward methodology for the preparation of solid supported enzymes and <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> assays, as well as the modification of planar surfaces for microanalytical devices and protein arrays...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in macroporous matrices like membrane adsorber and monoliths for the purification of cell culture-derived viral particles and viral vectors increased steadily. This trend is mainly attributed to their hydrodynamic benefits compared to classical <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> resins, which allow {{to reduce the}} overall process time. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} membrane adsorbern the availability of prepacked disposable capsules eliminate the need for packing, cleaning, sanitization and their validation. Here we give an overview on downstream processing of cell culture-derived influenza and vaccinia virus. Influenza viruses (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005, A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34, B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004) were derived from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures, and the Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA-BN®) from primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Specific focus will be the use of affinity membrane adsorption (MA) chromatography as capturing step. In addition, purification based on pseudo-affinity MA chromatography is compared to bead-based resins (Cellufine® sulfate) and conventional ion exchange MA. For influenza and vaccinia virus particles a remarkable high degree of contaminant depletion is achieved by use of affinity MA compared to ion exchange MA. Up to 90 % of the host cell DNA can be eliminated compared to the starting content. Contamination with host cell proteins can be reduced to less than 5 % of the initial amount. Overall, product yields of up to 90 % (influenza) and 80 % (vaccinia) were obtained.

The development of sensitive solid phase assays such as the ELISA technique, {{and in particular the}} <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> technology has revolutionised this field over the last 10 to 15 years. This revolution however has created a new paradigm in clinical decision making with respect to the detection of low level pre-transplant HLA sensitisation and its clinical relevance. The relative sensitivities of the assays used are discussed and the relevance of conflicting inter-assay results. Each assay has its advantages and disadvantages and these are discussed in detail. Over the last decade the <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> assay utilising the Luminex® fluorocytometer instrument has become established as the gold standard for HLA antibody testing. However there are still unresolved issues surrounding this technique, such as the presence of denatured HLA molecules on the beads which reveal cryptic epitopes and the issue of appropriate fluorescence cut off values for positivity. The assay has been modified to detect complement binding (CB) in addition to non-complement binding (NCB) HLA antibodies although the clinical relevance of the CB and NCB IgG isotypes is not fully resolved. The increase sensitivity of the Luminex® bead assay over the CDC crossmatch has permitted the concept of the virtual crossmatch whereby the crossmatch is predicted to a high degree of accuracy based on the HLA antibody specificities detected by the solid phase assay. Dialogue between clinicians and laboratory staff on an individual patient basis is essential for correct clinical decision making based on HLA antibody results obtained by the various techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} flow separation of magnetic particles from {{a mixture of}} particles could improve the performance of magnetic <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> assays but the formation of agglomerates limit the separation efficiency. Bead agglomerates are formed {{as a result of}} magnetic binding forces while the hydrodynamic fluid environment strongly influences their movement. The ability to predict the interaction between nearby beads will help to determine a threshold separation distance which will be recommended for use when obtaining measurement within a magnetic bead assay for a specified time interval. The introductory part of this thesis explored the development of a two dimensional numerical model in Matlab which predicts the trajectory pattern as well as magnetic induced velocities between a pair of super-paramagnetic beads suspended in water within a uniform field. The movement of a bead pair interacting due to both magnetic and hydrodynamic forces within a magnetophoretic system was recorded using an optical system; the beadsâ movements were compared with the simulated trajectories and gave a good agreement. The model was used to predict the shortest agglomeration time for a given separation distance which is of practical benefit to users of <b>bead</b> <b>based</b> assays. The concluding part of this thesis expanded the simulation into a three dimensional model to predict the interactions among three super-paramagnetic beads within a magnetophoretic system.
