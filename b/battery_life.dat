5|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>life</b> of the {{new models}} also {{received}} mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent <b>battery</b> <b>life</b> and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update. Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable <b>battery</b> <b>life</b> in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.|$|E
5|$|A call to {{increase}} the <b>battery</b> <b>life</b> of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer <b>battery</b> <b>life</b> or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day <b>battery</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120×2880 displays.

30|$|In [11], a {{simplified}} constant power model is adopted which considers capacity limit but {{the influence of}} relevant parameters are neglected. Such simplified model is incapable of effectively verifying the application results of energy storage. In [12], a Thevenin’s equivalent circuit model is used but it results in significant errors due to the negligence {{of the influence of}} the state of charge (SOC) on model parameters. The modeling methods in [13 – 15] present the corresponding numerical relationship between the open circuit voltage, the resistance, the capacitance and the SOC. However, methods for estimating SOC are not included. In [16], a corresponding spatial model based on the equivalent circuit model of lithium iron battery is proposed where the model parameters are estimated using least square method with variable forgetting factors. However, all the above-mentioned models fail to consider the capacity loss during the <b>battery’s</b> <b>life</b> cycle. In [17, 18], the cycle life of high-power lithium iron phosphate battery is studied. Experiment results indicate that battery aging leads to significant impedance amplification and capacity attenuation during the <b>battery’s</b> <b>life</b> cycle. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the battery capacity to avoid damages caused by over charge and discharge.|$|R

5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the <b>battery</b> <b>life</b> represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod <b>battery</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
