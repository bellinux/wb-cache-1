25|$|When cooking over a campfire, it is {{possible}} to use old-style lipped cast-iron Dutch ovens as true baking ovens, to prepare biscuits, cakes, breads, pizzas, and even pies. A smaller <b>baking</b> <b>pan</b> can be placed inside the ovens, used and replaced with another as the first batch is completed. It is also possible to stack Dutch ovens on top of each other, conserving the heat that would normally rise from the hot coals on the top. These stacks can be as high as 5 or 6 pots.|$|E

Each of the horses has got two sacks of gold, one of them has got the water-skin, two others have got twenty pounds of flour each, which will be enough to last us with the loaf we are baking here till we get out of the Indian country; the others have got the tea and sugar. The one with the skin will be the {{heaviest}} load at first; but the water will soon go, so that makes it even.

5000|$|A [...] "lasagna cell" [...] is accidentally {{produced}} when salty moist food such as lasagna {{is stored}} in a steel <b>baking</b> <b>pan</b> and is covered with aluminum foil. After a few hours the foil develops small holes where it touches the lasagna, and the food surface becomes covered with small spots composed of corroded aluminum. In this example, the salty food (lasagna) is the electrolyte, the aluminum foil is the anode, and the steel pan is the cathode. If the aluminum foil only touches the electrolyte in small areas, the galvanic corrosion is concentrated, and corrosion can occur fairly rapidly. If an aluminum <b>baking</b> <b>pan</b> is used instead, the rate of corrosion is markedly reduced, but still may occur.|$|E

At the exit of the croissant-making machine, the croissants are laid onto metal <b>baking</b> <b>pans,</b> and the pans are inserted into carts.|$|R
