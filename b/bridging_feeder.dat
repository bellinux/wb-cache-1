5000|$|F60 is {{the series}} {{designation}} of five overburden conveyor bridges used in brown coal (lignite) opencast mining in the Lusatian coalfields in Germany. They were {{built by the}} former Volkseigener Betrieb TAKRAF in Lauchhammer and are the largest movable technical industrial machines in the world. As overburden conveyor bridges, they transport the overburden which lies over the coal seam. The cutting height is 60 m, hence the name F60. With a length of 502 m, it is described as the lying Eiffel tower. In total, the F60 is up to 80 m high and 240 m wide. In operating condition, it weighs 13,600 metric tons. The first conveyor bridge was built from 1969 to 1972, being equipped with a <b>feeder</b> <b>bridge</b> in 1977. The second was built from 1972 to 1974, having been equipped with a <b>feeder</b> <b>bridge</b> during construction. The third conveyor bridge was built from 1976 to 1978, being provided with a <b>feeder</b> <b>bridge</b> in 1985. The fourth and fifth conveyor bridges were built 1986-1988 and 1988-1991 respectively.|$|R
50|$|The tin mills were powered {{exclusively}} by water {{drawn from the}} River Taff down the Melingriffith feeder stream, a water course that doubled as a canal that carried raw iron ore from the Pentyrch Iron Works until around 1815, when the Pentrych tramroad was completed. The tramroad crossed the River Taff over the Iron <b>Bridge.</b> The <b>feeder’s</b> lock was permanently closed in 1871 when it was bridged over, but traces of it still remain.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} improve the gravity {{discharge}} {{of water from the}} district, the sluice into the River Nene at Peters Point was rebuilt in 1937. Its width was reduced slightly to , but the cill was lowered to [...] below Ordnance Datum. In order to cope with the silty sub-soil in which the foundations had to be built, well point dewatering equipment was used {{for the first time in}} England. This consists of inserting small tubes into the ground and pumping them with a high-efficiency vacuum pump to lower the ground water levels, creating a dry and stable working environment. The need to grow more food during the Second World War led to large areas of low-lying grassland being ploughed up for crops, and this required improved drainage. The Main Drain Improvement Scheme was drawn up in 1942, and widening and deeping of the Main Drain and other channels was carried out. Ten new bridges were required, to accommodate the wider channels, and old brick structures were demolished and replaced by open span <b>bridges.</b> <b>Feeder</b> drains were improved, and the area served by the drainage board increased to [...]|$|R
50|$|The Chenango Canal was 42 {{feet wide}} {{at the top}} and 26 feet wide at the bottom and {{averaged}} 4 feet deep. It had 116 locks, 11 lock houses, 12 dams, 19 aqueducts, 52 culverts, 56 road bridges, 106 farm <b>bridges,</b> 53 <b>feeder</b> <b>bridges,</b> and 21 waste weirs. The Chenango was unique in that it was the first reservoir-fed canal in the U.S. In this design, reservoirs were created and feeder canals were dug to bring water to the summit level of the canal. This had been done previously in Europe, but had not been tried in the US. This project had to succeed by getting almost 23 miles of waterway up an incline with a 706’ elevation, to the summit level in Bouckville, and back down a descent of 303’ to the Susquehanna river in Binghamton. At a time when there were no engineering schools in the country, and hydrology was not yet a scientific discipline, Jervis and his team were able to design a complex waterway that was considered the best of its day.|$|R
40|$|Talc did {{not affect}} growth performance, carcass characteristics, or stomach {{ulceration}} in finishing pigs. <b>Feeder</b> <b>bridging</b> scores and coefficients of static force (the force needed to result in particle movement) were increased with added talc, both of which indicate reduced feed flowability. In a second experiment, reducing particle size from 1, 050 microns to 450 microns increased the coefficients of static force, dynamic force, and angle of repose. Adding talc to either particle size diet did not improve feed flow characteristics...|$|R
