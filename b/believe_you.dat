5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I <b>believe,</b> <b>you</b> were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E

[...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters."

[...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> change hearts.

500|$|Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each {{show was}} split in two. Dylan {{performed}} solo {{during the first}} half, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. In the second, backed by , he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slow handclapped. The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966. A recording of this concert was released in 1998: [...] At {{the climax of the}} evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: [...] "Judas!" [...] to which Dylan responded, [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>you...</b> You're a liar!" [...] Dylan turned to his band and said, [...] "Play it fucking loud!"

500|$|In 2012 Napravnik {{became the}} first woman jockey to win the Kentucky Oaks, riding <b>Believe</b> <b>You</b> Can. The race was also her first Grade I win. She then rode in the Belmont Stakes for the first time, {{finishing}} fifth aboard Five Sixteen. Later that year, she won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile aboard Shanghai Bobby, becoming only the second woman jockey to win a Breeder's Cup race. [...] Her injury for 2012 was relatively minor: a non-displaced fracture of her toe, obtained when her horse hit the side of the starting gate at Saratoga. [...] She finished the race and returned to ride the next day. She ended the year ranked 8th in national earnings, winning $12,451,713, which surpassed the earnings and national placing record for a female jockey previously held by Julie Krone. As a result, sports analysts viewed her as the most successful woman jockey since Krone.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut.

500|$|Another Side of Bob Dylan, {{recorded}} {{on a single}} evening in June 1964, had a lighter mood.

[...] "It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, {{has been described as a}} rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic [...] "Chimes of Freedom", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as [...] "chains of flashing images," [...] and [...] "My Back Pages", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.|$|E

With the win, pitcher Lowe became the first pitcher to ever win three series-clinching games in a single postseason having also won Game 3 of the ALDS against the Angels and Game 7 of the ALCS against the Yankees. Although the series was won in St. Louis, 3,000Red Sox fans were present at the game, and many stayed after the final out to celebrate with the team, including going on the field when the team came back out of their dugout with the World Series trophy. Ramírez, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, said afterwards [...] "I don't believe in curses, I <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> make your own destination.

500|$|Southampton's fifth round {{match was}} against Norwich City {{at home on}} 5 February 2003.

[...] The club then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the following round. Former Wolves player Chris Marsden gave Southampton the lead in the 56th minute and with nine minutes remaining of normal time, the team added a second goal when Tessem's shot took a deflection off Paul Butler's legs to go inside the goal net. The victory meant Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} 17 years. At Villa Park, Southampton played First Division team Watford on 13 April 2003. Brett Ormerod opened the scoring two minutes before half time and set up the second goal which the ball was taken over the line by Watford defender Paul Robinson. Despite Marcus Gayle scoring a late header to half the scoreline Southampton won the match.|$|E

500|$|With Woolley's {{permission}} to redo the obverse, Weinman decided {{to remove the}} word [...] "Liberty" [...] from above the figure and place it above [...] "In God We Trust" [...] {{to the right of}} it.

[...] The letter [...] "L" [...] was placed in the concavity formed by the flag as it drapes under the figure's left elbow, and the rest of the word extended to the right from there, with the letter T in larger print, actually saving room as the larger size allowed the crossbar of the [...] "T" [...] to extend above the capitalized letters [...] "R" [...] and [...] "Y".
