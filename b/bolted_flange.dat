50|$|One {{result was}} the Tripod foundation. The first design was drawn by OWT - Offshore Wind Technology in Leer (Germany) in 2005. The Tripod was {{integrally}} designed with the tower from this early beginning. The three-legged structure reaches from the sea bed up to typically 20m above the sea water level, keeping the <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> on top safely apart from {{the crest of the}} waves. This section allows to be outfitted onshore with all functionalities needed in terms of boat landing, cable guiding and last but not least corrosion protection systems. The central column is designed as an open system allowing an unrestricted water exchange in each tide cycle. This circumstance is beneficial when the corrosion protection system has to be designed for the inner surfaces.The Tripod is fixed with midsized pin piles at the sea bed. The piles might be pre piled or post piled. A suction bucket foundation was designed as well. The first tower section, called S3, is foreseen to be mounted offshore on top of the Tripod with a <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> connection. This section contains the outer service platform and the entry door. This section is independently accessible for electrical equipment and cold commissioning procedures. Additionally it provides simply height, what can be saved on Tripod side. The height of a Tripod amounts already about 60m for 40m water depth.|$|E

This provides the best possible access to the works inside. It also means that critical components are never buried deep inside the machine where they are hard to get at and thus very likely to be ignored until they cause problems.

40|$|The {{failure of}} sealing {{system of the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>flange</b> {{connections}} is the primary failure mode of the nuclear reactor pressure vessel (RPV). For the safety and integrity of RPV, {{it is important to}} predict the sealing behaviour of the <b>bolt</b> <b>flange</b> connections under various loading conditions. Based on the finite element (FE) method for coupled thermal elastoplastic contact problems, a three-dimensional (3 D) transient sealing analysis program of nuclear reactor pressure vessels is developed with the consideration of the non-linearity from both surface and material, transient heat transfer and multiple coupled effects. A contact correction approach is proposed to simulate the loading of the bolt connection under the condition of pre-stressing. An automatic pre-processing program is developed for FE modelling of RPVs. Using these programs, a 1 : 4 scaled model of a 300 MW RPV is analyzed under the loading conditions including pre-stressing, pressurization, heating and cooling. The computational results obtained are in a good agreement with the data of experimental tests. These programs are also successfully used in analyzing the full-scale model of the RPV in a nuclear power plant...|$|R
40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a flange joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional gasketed flange joints.

40|$|<b>Bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints form {{a part of}} {{pressure}} vessels and piping components, and are used extensively in the chemical, petrochemical and nuclear power industries. They are simple structures and offer the possibility of disassembly, making them attractive for connecting pressurized equipment and piping. In addition of being prone to leakage, they often require maintenance while in operation, {{in which case the}} bolts are either retightened, as in hot torquing, or untightened for replacement. Although such maintenance work prevents costly shutdowns, it can nevertheless expose the operator to a potential risk because altering the bolt load can produce a gasket load unbalance, which results in a local gasket contact stress drop below a critical value, causing a major leak, and putting the operator’s life at risk. This proposal addresses flange deflection variation as it investigates the flange contact stress level unbalance around the flange when the bolts are subjected to a load alteration during operation. This study may serve to help limit the degree of load increase in hot torquing or the maximum number of bolts to be replaced at a time, and to identify the flanges whose bolts cannot be replaced while they are in operation. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine a theoretical approach for identifying and analyzing the effects of initial bolt-up and pressurization on the <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints, in order to obtain a solution for bolt spacing calculation, according to different gasket contact stress variation levels.

In the third part, a linear regression model is developed to propose bolt spacing calculation procedures for <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joint connections.

40|$|After a {{comparatively}} short half century, PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) has invaded almost all applications of traditional materials, such as clay, cast iron, steel and asbestos cement, and becomes the premier pipe material. PVC is {{popular due to}} its advantages of immunity to corrosion and biological resistance. Convenient installation and handling are also two contributing factors to its popularity. PVC Piping systems {{have been widely used}} for fluids conveyance in industrial and building sites and household. <b>Bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints are important components of piping systems. They are mainly used as dismountable connections between pressure equipment ensuring structural integrity and leakage tightness. Meanwhile, the flange is a recommended mean to connect equipment of different materials. As other plastic materials, PVC also experience creep over time, the rate of which is influenced by load and temperature. Polyvinyl Chloride <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints undergo relaxation under compression for which the creep properties are different from those under tension. The sealing performance of a flange connection is impacted by its capacity to resist relaxation. For the purpose of improving the load currying capability and reduce leakage failures of PVC flange joints, it is important to properly understand and predict their creep-relaxation behavior.
