25|$|Most Japanese {{people and}} {{agencies}} have adopted customs {{to deal with}} these issues. Address books, for instance, often contain furigana or ruby characters to clarify the pronunciation of the name. Japanese nationals are also required to give a romanized name for their passport. The recent use of katakana in Japanese media when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young socialites who attempt to invoke a cosmopolitan flair using katakana names as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor.</b> All of these complications are also found in Japanese place names.|$|E

In 1949, the Polish government had intended to award Dodd with a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> called the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, but Dodd rejected the medal due to his commitment to human rights and views that the Polish government was imposing a tyranny similar to that imposed by the Nazis, and accepting an honor from the President of Poland would be like accepting one from the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|As senior executioner, Blokhin had the {{official}} title of commandant {{of the internal}} prison at the Lubyanka, which allowed him {{to carry out his}} duties with a minimum of scrutiny and no official paperwork. Although most of the estimated 828,000 NKVD executions conducted in Stalin's lifetime were performed by local Chekists in concert with NKVD troikas, mass executions were overseen by specialist executioners from the Kommandantura. In addition to overseeing the mass executions, Blokhin personally pulled the trigger in all of the individual high-profile executions conducted in the Soviet Union during his tenure, including those of the Old Bolsheviks convicted at the Moscow Show Trials; Marshal of the Soviet Union Mikhail Tukhachevsky (convicted at a secret trial); and two of the three fallen NKVD Chiefs (Genrikh Yagoda in 1938 and Nikolai Yezhov in 1940) he had once served under.

He was among the experts flown to Germany to recover the technology of the German V-2 rocket. The Soviets placed a priority on reproducing lost documentation on the V-2, and studying the various parts and captured manufacturing facilities. That work continued in East Germany until late 1946, when 2,000+ German scientists and engineers were sent to Russia through Operation Osoaviakhim. Most of the German experts, Helmut Gröttrup being an exception, were engineers and technicians involved in wartime mass-production of V-2, and they had not worked directly with Wernher von Braun. Many of the leading German rocket scientists, including Dr. von Braun himself, surrendered to Americans and were transported to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip.|$|E

500|$|There was a noted {{effort on}} the part of Corps staff and other Transylvanian exiles (Ion Agârbiceanu, Laurian Gabor, Octavian Tăslăuanu etc.) to {{encourage}} the rapid integration of Podil-formed units into the Romanian line of defense. After a quick session of retraining, the Corps units were attached to the 11th Division, which was recovering in Iași. It was, however, decided that the formations, particularly those from Transylvania, were to be kept distinguished from the rest under the common command structure. An official act of 1918 explained the rationale behind this act: [...] "Transylvanians should fight as Transylvanians [...] against the Hungarian state, so as to assert, clearly and beyond all doubt, that the Romanian nationals of the Hungarian state do not recognize its authority. To have fought against Hungary, however the war may end, ought to have been a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> for the Romanian nation in Hungary and a moral reinforcement during the battles to come". When it was proposed that men from the Corps be assigned noms de guerre so as to avoid execution if captured, Deleu reacted strongly: [...] "We intend to be the army of Transylvania! We aim to be the conscience of Transylvania, which is for absolute freedom and The Union! We do not want [...] a conquered land, we wish to liberate ourselves with our own forces! Hangings? Let them hang us! But let them be aware that Transylvania herself is fighting for liberty and The Union!" ...|$|E
500|$|As in {{the case}} of the first Mortal Kombat game, the content of Mortal Kombat II became the subject of a great deal of {{controversy}} regarding violent video games. Nancian Cherry of Toledo Blade wrote that both games had [...] "an army of critics too: people upset by the bone-crunching, blood-spurting, limb-ripping violence depicted on the small screen." [...] According to IGN, [...] "Mortal Kombat II wore its notoriety as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor,</b> boasting about it in promotional materials, and even parodying it in-game." [...] The game was banned in Germany, where MKII was put in the index by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM) and all versions of the game except for the Game Boy version were subjected to being confiscated from the nation's market for violating the German Penal Code by showing excessive violence and cruel acts against representations of human beings. Due to regional censorship, the game was also released with green-colored blood and black-and-white fatality sequences in Japan; it was at that time a unique occurrence of a western game being censored in Japan, not the reverse. Years later, Boon recalled: [...] "I've always had the position that the rating system was a good idea and should be put in place. Once Mortal Kombat II came out, there was a rating system in place. We were an M-rated game, and everybody knew the content that was in there, so it became almost a non-issue." [...] Tobias agreed, saying that they [...] "were content with the M for mature on our packaging." ...|$|E
60|$|Is this so? Titles and <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> are vanity; {{and in the}} American Revolution {{you have}} his Excellency General Washington sending back, and with proper spirit sending back, a letter {{in which he is}} not {{addressed}} as Excellency and General. Titles are abolished; and the American Republic swarms with men claiming and bearing them. You have the French soldier cheered and happy in his dying agony, and kissing with frantic joy the chief's hand who lays the little cross on the bleeding bosom. At home you have the Dukes and Earls jobbing and intriguing for the Garter; the Military Knights grumbling at the Civil Knights of the bath; the little ribbon eager for the collar; the soldiers and seamen from India and the Crimea marching in procession before the Queen, and receiving from her hands the cross bearing her royal name. And, remember, there are not only the cross wearers, but all the fathers and friends; all the women who have prayed for their absent heroes; Harry's wife, and Tom's mother, and Jack's daughter, and Frank's sweetheart, each of whom wears in her heart of hearts afterwards the badge which son, father, lover, has won by his merit; each of whom is made happy and proud, and is bound to the country by that little bit of ribbon.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Keeping FOSS {{developers}} motivated is {{a challenging}} problem, and their motivation levels {{can affect the}} team's productivity and satisfaction, leading to higher or lower productivity. Using reputation systems as a motivator has become the de-facto standard for many online communities, rewarding user's activity through <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> or achievement levels. Few open source software communities have successfully used a well-rounded reputation system to motivate developers, instead rewarding only one or a small set of activities. Very {{little research has been}} done in the area of using reputation systems to motivate people to increase their participation in open source software projects. This thesis studies Beaversource; a mix of code-hosting and social networking available to students, staff and faculty at Oregon State University, and our experiment with reputation systems as a means of motivating programmers. A survey was sent to 1, 100 + Beaversource users at Oregon State University to gather demographics, and data on the use of Beaversource. One hundred users responded. Based on survey feedback, a reputation system was put in place. After the karma system was available to users, five students were interviewed to gather more information regarding their satisfaction with Beaversource and the karma system. Users reported that the reputation system worked to motivate them. Interviewees {{would like to see the}} karma system expanded with better icons and increased participation in the social networking side. Students also requested more flexibility in the karma system such as ability to affect each other's karma and give special <b>badges</b> to members <b>of</b> their project...|$|R

40|$|T. S. Eliot (1963 : 112), who famously {{declared}} in 1921 that "poets in our civilization, {{as it exists}} at present, must be difficult," made difficulty a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> modernist <b>honor.</b> The attitudes <b>of</b> academic criticism since then might be categorized according to their degree of acceptance or rejection of this premise. New Criticism, by and large, made a virtue of difficulty, measuring poetic achievement {{in terms of the}} poet's management of tension and paradox. Conversely, recent criticism has often looked askance at difficulty, suspecting that it may be a form of mystificatory elitism or an instance of dishonestly evasive impersonality. However one chooses to view the matter theoretically, difficulty is an inescapable dimension of modernist texts, especially those that exemplify high-modernist experimentation [...] Eliot's The Waste Land, Pound's Cantos, Joyce's Ulysses, Barnes's Nightwood, Stein's Tender Buttons, Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, Toomer's Cane, Dos Passos's U. S. A. trilogy [...] in short, many of the most frequently taught works in the curriculum of twentieth-century literature. This essay proposes that hypertext is a practical, though partial, solution to the nearly insuperable problems associated with reading and teaching the difficult modernist text. Because my students and I have created and studied with a hypertext of Pound's Canto 81, my examples are drawn primarily from that poem. The hypertextual version of this Canto provides access not only to the poem's "information" but to Pound's working methods, his aims in writing this "poem including history," and his presentation of the poem as covert and overt pedagogy...|$|R
