50|$|Swordmakers in Toledo, Spain, {{developed}} {{a market in}} the 1920s for gold plated automatic leverlock knives with pearl handles and enamel inlaid blades. Italian knifemakers had their own style of knives including both pushbutton and leverlock styles, some bearing design characteristics similar to the early French Châtellerault knife. Prior to World War II, hand crafted automatic knives marked Campobasso or Frosolone were often called Flat Guards because of the two-piece top bolster design. Some Italian switchblades incorporated a bayonet-type blade equipped with a <b>blade</b> <b>lock</b> release activated by picking a lever at the hinge end, and were known as picklocks. These were later supplanted by newer designs which incorporated the <b>blade</b> <b>lock</b> release into a tilting bolster, which released a spearpoint or bayonet-style blade.|$|E

As the user applies manual pressure to the thumbstud to open the knife, a mechanism such as a torsion spring moves along a track in the liner and rapidly rotates the blade into the open and locked position.|$|E
40|$|An {{introduction}} to aircraft state and parameter identification methods is presented. A simplified {{form of the}} maximum likelihood method is selected to extract analytical aeroelastic rotor models from simulated and dynamic wind tunnel test results for accelerated cyclic pitch stirring excitation. The dynamic inflow characteristics for forward flight conditions from the blade flapping responses without direct inflow measurements were examined. The rotor blades are essentially rigid for inplane bending and for torsion within the frequency range of study, but flexible in out-of-plane bending. Reverse flow effects are considered for high rotor advance ratios. Two inflow models are studied; the first {{is based on an}} equivalent <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number, the second is based on a time delayed momentum inflow. In addition to the inflow parameters, basic rotor parameters like the blade natural frequency and the actual <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number are identified together with measurement bias values. The effect of the theoretical dynamic inflow on the rotor eigenvalues is evaluated...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of dynamic inflow on rotor-blade flapping and vertical motion of the helicopter in hover. Linearized versions of two dynamic inflow models, one developed by Carpenter and Fridovich and the other by Pitt and Peters, were incorporated in simplified rotor-body models and were compared for variations in thrust coefficient and the <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number. In addition, a comparison was made between the results of the linear analysis, and the transient and frequency responses measured in flight on the CH- 47 B variable-stability helicopter. Results indicate that the correlations are good, considering the simplified model used. The linear analysis also shows that dynamic inflow {{plays a key role in}} destabilizing the flapping mode. The destabilized flapping mode, along with the inflow mode that the dynamic inflow introduces, results in a large initial overshoot in the vertical acceleration response to an abrupt input in the collective pitch. This overshoot becomes more pronounced as either the thrust coefficient or the <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number is reduced. Compared with Carpenter's inflow model, Pitt's model tends to produce more oscillatory responses because of the less stable flapping mode predicted by it...|$|E

The results also show that teeter response is sensitive to the direction of yaw, and that teeter response to yaw is reduced as either the rotor speed or the <b>blade</b> <b>lock</b> number is increased...|$|E

The model was used in several exploratory studies of the flying qualities of helicopters {{with a variety of}} rotor systems. The basic assumptions used and the major steps involved {{in the development of the}} set of equations listed are described. The equations consisted of the tip-path plane dynamic equation, the equations for the main rotor forces and moments, and the equation for control phasing required to achieve decoupling in pitch and roll due to cyclic inputs...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that dynamic rotor inflow has a {{substantial}} effect on rotor dynamic loads. Despite {{the complexity of the}} unsteady flow problem, simple analytical models can be made useful by identifying their parameters from transient response tests without performing flow measurements. Two analytical inflow models are studied: the first is based on an equivalent <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number, the second is based on a time delayed unsteady momentum inflow. In preparation for the experimental data analysis, identifications from simulated test data and an eigenvalue analysis are performed. The experimental results show that the first analytical inflow model is accurate for rotor advance ratios of 0. 4 and above. For lower advance ratios, the second inflow model provides better accuracy. Prediction studies with experimental data not used for the identification are performed to determine the accuracy of the mathematical models...|$|E

40|$|State and {{parameter}} identifications from simulated {{forward flight}} blade flapping measurements are presented. The transients were excited by progressing cyclic pitch stirring or by hub stirring with constant stirring acceleration. Rotor dynamic inflow models of varying degree of sophistication were used from a one parameter inflow model (equivalent Lock number) to an eight parameter inflow model. The maximum likelihood method with assumed fixed measurement error covariance matrix was applied. The rotor system equations for both fixed hub and tilting hub are given. The identified models were verified by comparing true responses with predicted responses. An optimum {{utilization of the}} simulated measurement data can be defined. From the numerical results it can be anticipated that brief periods of either accelerated cyclic pitch stirring or of hub stirring are sufficient to extract with adequate accuracy up to 8 rotor dynamic inflow parameters plus the <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number from the transients...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a study {{conducted}} to investigate further a means of choosing primary rotor parameters to reduce the coupling of longitudinal and lateral flapping in hover and in forward flight are presented. The rotor parameters included - flapping hinge offset, flapping hinge restraint, pitch-flap coupling, and <b>blade</b> <b>Lock</b> number - are known to influence the agility, stability, and operational safety of helicopters. Effects of the nonuniform downwash model of White and Blake on the blade flapping motion are examined, and the theoretical calculation is then correlated with experimental test data. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates, which was previously obtained for a hovering rotor, is evaluated in forward flight. The results show that negligible coupling is achieved in forward flight; moreover, there is the additional benefit of a slight reduction in the coupling of the roll rate to coning. It is also indicated that {{the values of the}} rotor parameters chosen according to the decoupling condition are moderate and that the flapping motion is stable with the parameters chosen...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{flapping}} dynamics of four main rotor design features {{that influence the}} agility, stability, and operational safety of helicopters are studied. The parameters include flapping hinge offset, flapping hinge restraint, pitch-flap coupling, and <b>blade</b> <b>lock</b> number. First, the flapping equations of motion are derived that explicitly contain the design parameters. The dynamic equations are then developed for the tip-path plane, {{and the influence of}} individual and combined variations in the design parameters determined. The steady state flapping response is examined with respect to control input and aircraft angular rate which leads to a feedforward control law for control decoupling through cross feed, and a feedback control law to decouple the steady state flapping response. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates without using feedback control is also found for the hover case. It is indicated that the frequency of the regressing flapping mode of the rotor system can become low enough to require consideration in the assessment of handling characteristics...|$|E

25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the <b>blade,</b> thus <b>locking</b> the <b>blade</b> in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the <b>blade</b> <b>locking</b> surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|R
40|$|For many years, {{analysts have}} been {{puzzled by the}} fact that the {{off-axis}} coupling of a helicopter exhibits the opposite sign in flight tests as compared to simulations. Recently, researchers have shown that the effect may be attributable to the bending of the wake during a pitching maneuver, which introduces a fore-to-aft gradient in induced flow that can reverse the predicted sign of the roll coupling. Other research as shown that this result can also be obtained with momentum and vortex theory. There are many issues still under debate regarding the magnitude of wake distortion and its effectiveness in predicting off-axis dynamics. In the present work, a generalized ynamic wake model is augmented to include wake distortions. This model is then coupled with a flap model for simulation in low speed forward flight. Frequency responses from the simulation are collected with and without wake distortion, and these are compared with wind tunnel test data.

2500|$|The peasant knife, farmer knife, or penny knife is the {{original}} and most basic design of a folding pocketknife, using a simple pivoted blade that folds {{in and out of}} the handle freely, without a backspring, slipjoint, or <b>blade</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. [...] The first peasant knives date to the pre-Roman era, but were not widely distributed nor affordable by most people until the advent of limited production of such knives in cutlery centers such as Sheffield, England commencing around 1650, with large-scale production starting around the year 1700 with models such as Fuller's Penny Knife and the Wharncliffe Knife. [...] Some peasant knives used a bolster or tensioning screw at the blade to apply friction to the blade tang in order to keep the blade in the open position. [...] The smallest (Nos. 2 -5) Opinel knives are an example of the peasant knife. [...] The knife's low cost made it a favorite of small farmers, herdsmen, and gardeners in Europe and the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th century.|$|R
2500|$|Most pocket knives {{for light}} duty are slipjoints.

[...] The first spring-back knives were developed around 1660 in England, but were not widely available until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution and the development of machinery capable of mass production. [...] Most locking knives have only one blade that is as large as can be fitted into the handle, because the locking mechanism relies on the spring along the back of the <b>blade</b> to <b>lock</b> it {{and it is difficult to}} build in multiple levers, one for each blade.
