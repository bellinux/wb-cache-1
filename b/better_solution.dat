5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy's special {{military}} representative, had {{become interested in}} the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing infiltration of PAVN materiel (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who convinced him that a <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> to the infiltration dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could possibly be a <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b> This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E
5|$|A foam is {{a mass of}} bubbles; foams of {{different}} materials occur in nature. Foams composed of soap films obey Plateau's laws, which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the tetrahedral angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, {{and to have a}} constant average curvature at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back). Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. Lord Kelvin identified the problem of {{the most efficient way to}} pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure; the Beijing National Aquatics Center adapted the structure for their outer wall in the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E

Their idea is to re-engineer common Home appliance with small (fractional – less than 1-horsepower) electric motors (c. 500W – 1000W) which are used for short periods, for example food mixers, grinding machines, hand-held power-drills and light wood-working equipment.|$|E

30|$|From {{the test}} results, {{it can be}} found that by setting the {{evaporation}} factor to 0.1, the proposed algorithm can yield <b>better</b> <b>solutions.</b> This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that if pheromone evaporation is too rapid, it more easily results in the search to be trapped in local minimum. In other words, the smaller evaporation factor can ensure the sufficient diversity of search space and guide following ants to explore <b>better</b> <b>solutions.</b>|$|R

25|$|The main {{figures in}} this debate were John Maynard Keynes from Cambridge and the LSE's Friedrich Hayek. The LSE Economist Lionel Robbins was also heavily involved.

Keynes put forward the theories now known as Keynesian economics, involving the active participation {{of the state and}} public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the Austrian School, which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To {{optimize}} makespan {{and reliability}} for workflow applications, most existing works use list heuristics rather than genetic algorithms (GAs) which can usually give <b>better</b> <b>solutions.</b> In addition, most existing GAs evolve a scheduling solution randomly, which may give invalid solutions or lead to slow convergence of the algorithm. In this paper, we define three heuristics for GAs {{to decide the}} priorities for a resource and a task dynamically. We propose Look-Ahead Genetic Algorithm (LAGA) to optimize both makespan and reliability for workflow applications. It uses a novel evolution and evaluation mechanism: the genetic operators evolve the task-resource mapping for a scheduling solution, while the solution’s task order is determined in the evaluation step using our new max-min strategy, which is specifically proposed for GAs. Our experiments show that LAGA can provide <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> than existing list heuristics and evolve to <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> more quickly than a traditional genetic algorithm. 1...|$|R
25|$|During a {{demonstration}} of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation {{was the only way to}} repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> would be to nationalise Power Jets only.|$|E
25|$|A <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> {{came along}} {{in the form of}} the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of {{problems}} as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual scanning system {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator to scan the sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could flip a switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they decided this concept simply didn't work, and that the mechanical scanning systems were a <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a modification of}} the well-known Solomon (1987) sequential insertion heuristic I 1 for the Vehicle Routingwith Time Windows (VRPTW). VRPTW involves servicing customers within a pre-specified service time window by homogeneouslyvehicles from a single depot. By using two new measures for the additional time needed to insert a customer inroute, significantly <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> are obtained for relatively short routes compared to the original Solomon (1987) insertion heuristic I 1. Because high-quality initial heuristics often allow local searches and metaheuristics tobetter solutions more quickly, the new approach is likely to help generating <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> to practical routing...|$|R
30|$|Compared to single-objective {{approaches}}, multi-objective {{approaches are}} generally {{proved to be}} capable of producing <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> since more relevant factors can be considered as optimization objectives and evaluated in non-commensurable units in different relevant areas.|$|R

25|$|Almost immediately, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to look at options for converting {{all or part of the}} canals into railways, and extending the network. Although they had already tried using a steam tug to haul a train of boats, they realised that not all of their canals were suitable for such use, and that a locomotive on a railway with good gradients offered a <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b> The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal were alarmed by the announcement that many of the canals might close, on the basis that removal of one would have a serious effect on another, and sought to oppose the action.|$|E
25|$|The Penang state {{government}} at the time under the then Chief Minister, Koh Tsu Koon attempted to revamp the state's ailing bus network. Under the revamped routes that were launched in 2006, bigger buses were made to run along trunk routes while minibuses ran feeder routes which branched off the trunk routes. The revamp, however, failed to improve the situation, leading the Penang {{state government}} to study the revamp already conducted in Kuala Lumpur and request for federal intervention. It was felt that bringing in Rapid KL, which already had the expertise and know-how, was the <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> than simply purchasing more buses, although Rapid KL at the time chose to focus on its core operations in the Klang Valley.|$|E
25|$|After the fur trade {{declined}} in the mid-nineteenth century, Prairie du Chien's attention shifted to agriculture and the railroad. Although the city was first connected to the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad in 1857, {{the width of the}} Mississippi River posed a challenge for further expansion of the railroad into Iowa. This problem was temporarily solved by disassembling the trains at Prairie du Chien and ferrying them across the river to be put back on the tracks on the other side. A <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> was found by Michael Spettel and John Lawler, who designed a permanent pontoon bridge to span the river in 1874. Lawler took most of the credit for this invention, and made a small fortune through its operation.|$|E

25|$|Simple {{heuristics}} like hill climbing, which move {{by finding}} better neighbour after better neighbour and stop {{when they have}} reached a solution which has no neighbours that are <b>better</b> <b>solutions,</b> cannot guarantee to lead {{to any of the}} existing <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> – their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.|$|R

25|$|In 1940 he {{introduced}} a much <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> using a system {{known today as}} hybrid color. This used a traditional black and white CRT with a rotating colored filter in front. Three frames, sent {{one after the other}} in a system known as sequential scan, were displayed on the CRT while the colored wheel was spun in synchronicity. This design was physically very long, leading to deep receiver chassis, but later versions folded the optical path using mirrors to produce a somewhat more practical system. Again, Baird {{was not the only one}} to produce such a system, with CBS displaying a very similar system at almost the same time. However, Baird was not happy with the design later stated that a fully electronic device would be better.|$|E
25|$|Murtaja {{was often}} criticized for her poor {{performance}} in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906. Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing Murtaja, in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, Tarmo, without selling the old one. As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, Murtaja was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She {{was said to be}} in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be a <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
25|$|Delays and {{failures}} in the Granite programme and the abandonment of Green Bamboo without a test, left {{a gap in the}} programme and an emergency capability weapon to fill that gap was devised from elements of both Green Bamboo and Orange Herald; being known as Knobkerry, or Green Grass, and the Interim Megaton Weapon. There were also other factors involved in the decision to build an Interim Megaton Weapon. One being that the UK HEU production programme was by 1957 producing quantities of HEU for which there was no immediate need; and the Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to see it continue to languish in stores, unused for weapons, when it was being produced at great cost. The Green Grass warhead containing perhaps 70–86kg of HEU (although there are no reliable declassified sources for this figure) was therefore hurriedly produced and installed in a modified Blue Danube casing, to be known as Violet Club, until a <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> based on the Yellow Sun casing could be produced, known then with Green Grass installed, as Yellow Sun Mk.1. Only five Violet Club weapons were produced, known by the RAF description of Bomb, Aircraft, HE 9,000lb HC, and they were stripped of their Green Grass warheads for transfer to the better casings when these became available.|$|E
