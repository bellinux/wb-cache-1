50|$|Why FarasutoThe {{significance}} of Farasuto forest is fully {{understood by the}} people of Kuloro, the village within which the site lies on the southern banks of the Gambia River 11 miles due south of the capital Banjul. Local people concerned about the site (the forest patch and some adjoining woodland, total area around 9ha) and its future held the first public Open Day there on 25 October 2008. the forest project founders were introduced to the site during a three-week visit to country in January 2009 and an open meeting was arranged, with all village interests attending, on 20 January. Through an interpreter they explained that they were prepared to help prepare a Management Plan for their nature reserve. The offer of help was very gratefully and warmly received and work has begun. The Management Plan is an essential component in plotting a secure future for the site and its wildlife, not least its birds - its major attraction. The Plan will also act as a <b>bidding</b> <b>document</b> for the works identified as necessary for successful and sustainable management into the long term.|$|E

40|$|In the UK, new {{building}} regulations (‘Part L 2006 ’) to reduce energy consumption {{and carbon dioxide}} emissions within the built environment came into force in 2006. It is now mandatory that all new built and refurbished buildings demonstrate compliance with ‘Target Carbon Emissions Rates’ in the design phase. This has prompted some interesting questions concerning their procurement. Under traditional UK procurement arrangements, designs are, in theory, completed before the contractor becomes involved. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in the use of Design-and-Build procurement: a system which actively supports concurrency in design, procurement and construction. Under such arrangements, the design of environmentally sensitive buildings may be seen as a challenging task, as the iterations required are at odds with the contractor’s incentive to avoid delays and extra cost. This has prompted a preliminary investigation into the opportunities and limitations afforded by different procurement methods for delivering environmentally sensitive buildings. Although these issues are fairly ubiquitous throughout the various building elements, the particular focus was on façade design and construction. Data collection was by structured questionnaire and interviews carried out with large construction companies, architectural practices and building performance consultants. There was a consensus that Part L 2006 has major implications for procurement and that compliance is a major step change. A new and indispensable <b>bidding</b> <b>document,</b> the ‘Building Energy Model’, will emerge and in its absence most contractors would decline invitations to bid. There will be an impact on procurement, probably in the form of an extension of the use of ‘novation’. Design-and-Build contractors will ‘freeze’ designs earlier, and forgo the potential for later value engineering in order to avoid risks, which they see as significant. Finally, despite the industry’s ‘fear’ of Part L 2006, the regulation has already created a welcome by-product in the form of a clear increase in collaborative work among design and construction teams...|$|E

40|$|Unresolved {{disputes}} {{can lead}} to project delay, increased tension and can damage long term business relationship. As a result, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods were evolved during {{the passage of time}} to resolve construction disputes. Dispute Avoidance Procedures, which include Dispute Review Boards (DRB) and Dispute Adjudication Boards (DAB) are used in the construction industry since those methods are encourage parties to resolve their disputes at site level. The DAB first started to use in Sri Lanka after the FIDIC (1999) red book was introduced to use and due to the insistence of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as funding agencies for the mega development projects. Although many research papers of foreign countries stated that their success with the DAB, Sri Lankan construction industry mostly practiced adjudication in ad-hoc manner. This research was carried out to provide suggestions to overcome the barriers to implement the full term DAB method in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to find out the genuine reasons behind the reluctance of stakeholders in Sri Lankan construction industry towards ADR methods and why stakeholders even do not use adjudication which has been recognized as an effective and efficient ADR method, elsewhere in the world. Questionnaire survey was carried out among contractor and consultant organisations and semi structured interviews were carried to gather descriptive answers from them. The research revealed the barriers to implement the full term DAB in Sri Lanka and provides suggestions to overcome those barriers. The research would also be conducted based on the provisions in Conditions of Contract for Construction for Building and Engineering Works Designed by the Employer (FIDIC 1999) first edition and Standard <b>Bidding</b> <b>Document</b> Procurement of Works Major Contracts (ICTAD/SBD/ 02) second edition. A pivotal conclusion of this research is that the stakeholders in the construction industry prefer “adjudication” as an effective ADR method.

40|$|Abstract: The {{construction}} procurement {{evaluation method}} using lowest price conforming methods often causes some quality problems for  owners {{and increases the}} probability of dispute and delay during the contract execution. On the other hand, merit point system evaluation method can provide quality assurance, but the procurement committees are often dificult to apply it, and to determaine mesurable criteria evaluation. Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} a more in-depth study to find out the criteria evaluation for construction procurement. The research conducted in Bali, and adopted inductive qualitative approach involving 45 experts participated in construction procurements using merit point system evaluation. Puposive sampling is applied to determine the respondents come from all actors included during procurement process. The data was collected through interviews, observation participant and questionnaires, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is choosed to analyse them. The result shows that : the merit point system evaluation for construction procurement can determine the contractor provides better quality than the lowest price conforming method when theevaluation criteria are clear, mesurable and transparant in the <b>bidding</b> <b>document.</b> There are two principle aspects that must be considered to assurethe quality that is: the technical aspect and the cost that weight consecutively 60 % and 40 %. The technical aspect comprises of : a) the existance of work plan (13. 51 %), comprising of construction methods (4. 12 %), supporting  equipment (4. 05 %), supporting material (3. 46 %), suporting workers (1. 88 %); b) competencies of human recources (19. 91 %), comprising of project management competencies(2. 31 %), existence of expert (7. 92 %) and certificated human resources (9. 68 %); c) existence of supporting equipments (15. 54 %) consisted of lifting support (4. 79 %), transportation support (6. 17 %), surveying support equipment(4. 58 %); d) the existing of time management (6. 30 %) consisted of network planning (4. 13 %), bar chart (1. 03 %), and S-curve (1. 14 %); and e) existence of quality assurance (2. 14 %) consisted of quality management system (1. 95 %), performance quality management (0. 66 %) and material management quality (2. 14 %).
