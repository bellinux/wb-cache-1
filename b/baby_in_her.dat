5|$|As {{with all}} but the first scene of the Matsudaira scroll, this scene is set {{on the evening of}} Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the Ika-no-iwai of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō. The {{painting}} shows a room inside a shinden partitioned off by kichō room dividers featuring the design of decaying trees. Empress Shōshi, with the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms, is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E

25|$|Dionysus had {{a strange}} birth that evokes the {{difficulty}} in fitting him into the Olympian pantheon. His mother was a mortal woman, Semele, the daughter of king Cadmus of Thebes, and his father was Zeus, {{the king of the}} gods. Zeus's wife, Hera, discovered the affair while Semele was pregnant. Appearing as an old crone (in other stories a nurse), Hera befriended Semele, who confided in her that Zeus was the actual father of the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> womb. Hera pretended not to believe her, and planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind. Curious, Semele demanded of Zeus that he reveal himself in all his glory as proof of his godhood.|$|E
500|$|A {{woman who}} lost four {{family members in}} the {{incident}} said, [...] "We don't know why this foreign soldier came and killed our innocent family members. Either he was drunk or he enjoyed killing civilians." [...] Abdul Samad, a 60-year-old farmer who lost eleven family members, eight of whom were children, spoke about the incident: [...] "I don't know why they killed them. Our government told us {{to come back to}} the village, and then they let the Americans kill us." [...] One grieving mother, holding a dead <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms, said, [...] "They killed a child, was this child the Taliban?

500|$|Camila grows {{very ill}} {{and a boy}} is sent to inform Miguel Angel Face that her {{condition}} has worsened. He dresses quickly and rushes to the Two Step to see her. Eventually relieved of charges by the President, Fedina de Rodas is purchased by a brothel, {{and when it is}} discovered that she is holding her dead <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms, she is placed in a hospital. Miguel Angel Face informs Major Farfan, who is {{in the service of the}} President, that there is a threat to his life. By this act saving a man in danger, Angel Face hopes [...] "God would grant him Camila's life in exchange". General Canales escapes into a village and, assisted by three sisters and a smuggler, crosses the frontier of the country after saving the sisters by killing a doctor who harassed them with the payment of an absurd debt.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{includes}} {{a host of}} minor characters who, in Richard Franklin's words, [...] "grope for the means to assert the validity of self and to anchor this individuality in a nightmare which constantly faces it with black nothingness". These characters range from Colonel José Parrales Sonriente, otherwise known as the [...] "man with the little mule", whose murder at the Cathedral Porch opens the novel, {{to a series of}} beggars, prisoners, minor officials, relatives, flatterers, barkeepers and prostitutes. Some of these are tragic figures, such as Fedina de Rodas, who readers see tortured and then sold to a brothel while she still clutches her dead <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms. Others, however, provide comic relief. Sometimes they have colorful or playful names or nicknames, such as [...] "Flatfoot" [...] (a beggar), the [...] "Talking Cow" [...] (a woman who delivers a speech of praise to the President), or Doña Benjamin VenJamón, who, with her husband the puppet-master Don Benjamin, closes the novel with a lament for the demise of the Cathedral Porch.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the renewal}} of the war with Poland, Gustavus Adolphus had to leave his wife again. It is likely that she gave way to hysterical grief, as we know she did in 1627, and it is {{probably}} {{for this reason that}} the king let his queen join him in Livonia after the Poles had been defeated in January 1626. By April, Maria Eleonora found she was again pregnant. No risks were taken this time and the astrologers predicted the birth of a son and heir. During a lull in the warfare, Gustavus Adolphus hurried back to Stockholm to await the arrival of the baby. The birth was a difficult one. On 7 December, a baby was born with a fleece (lanugo), which enveloped it from its head to its knees, leaving only its face, arms and lower part of its legs free. Moreover, it had a large nose and was covered with hair. Thus, it was assumed the baby was a boy, and so the King was told. Closer inspection, however, determined that the baby was a girl. Gustavus Adolphus' half-sister Catherine informed him that the child was a girl. She [...] "carried the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms to the king in a condition for him to see and to know and realise for himself what she dared not tell him". Gustavus Adolphus remarked: [...] "She is going to be clever, for she has taken us all in." [...] His disappointment did not last long, and he decided that she would be called Christina after his mother. He gave orders for the birth to be announced with all the solemnity usually accorded to the arrival of a male heir. This seems to indicate that Gustavus Adolphus, at the age of 33, had little hope of having other children. Maria Eleonora's state of health seems to be the most likely explanation for this. Her later portraits and actions, however, do not indicate that she was physically fragile.|$|E

[...] In addition to providing medical services, Callen taught women from the community to be midwives.|$|R
