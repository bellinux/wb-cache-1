Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: [...] "Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> her music would be my bible". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds Of Love: [...] "I love the way it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be [...] "beauty beyond belief". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled [...] "Bird in Hand" [...] (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Bush was one of the singers who Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls. In December 1989, Robert Smith of The Cure chose [...] "The Sensual World" [...] as his favourite single of the year, The Sensual World as his favourite album of the year and included [...] "all of Kate Bush" [...] plus other artists in his list, [...] "the best things about the eighties".|$|E

Some of her earlier film appearances include roles in Midsummer Night's Dream, Age of Consent, O Lucky Man!, Caligula, Excalibur, 2010, The Long Good Friday, White Nights, When the Whales Came and The Mosquito Coast. She appeared in Some Mother's Son, Painted Lady, The Prince of Egypt and The Madness of King George. One of her other film roles was in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, as the thief's wife, opposite Michael Gambon. In Teaching Mrs. Tingle, she plays sadistic history teacher Mrs Eve Tingle. In 2007, she claimed director Michael Winner had treated her [...] "like a piece of meat" [...] at a casting call in 1964. Asked about the incident, Winner told The Guardian: [...] "I don't remember asking her to turn around <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> I wasn't being serious. I was only doing what the [...] agent asked me– and for this I get reviled! Helen's a lovely person, she's a great actress and I'm a huge fan, but her memory of that moment is a little flawed." ...|$|E
