5|$|Venable {{had been}} {{expected}} to be a September 2008 call-up, but when Scott Hairston was forced onto the disabled list, Venable was called up ahead of schedule. On August 29, 2008, in his debut, he tripled in his first at-bat and came around to score a run. He is the twenty-fifth Princeton alumnus to play in the Major Leagues, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first African-American alumnus. He posted his first Major League home run in his sixth game on September 4, 2008, during a 5–2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. His only other home run for the 2008 San Diego Padres was also in a victory on the road on September 19, 2008 in an 11–6 victory over the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. During this game, Venable posted his first three-hit performance and first three-RBI performance. When Venable batted leadoff for the Padres on September 28, 2008 against Pittsburgh, he became the first Princeton batter to oppose a Princeton pitcher (Ross Ohlendorf). In 2008, Venable accumulated only 110Major League at-bats, and rookie year is considered to be the season in which one accumulates his 130th at-bat. He only played centerfield in 2008. Following the season he played winter baseball in the Dominican Professional Baseball League, where he struggled.|$|E

25|$|Kenny McElvey: {{played by}} Michael Manasseri, Kenny is an 18-year-old who becomes Sandpiper's backup pilot during a second season story arc where Joe is {{grounded}} for hypertension. The comedic {{focus of the}} character was his youth and relative inexperience, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most qualified of the small pool of applicants to be Joe's replacement. Kenny leaves Sandpiper after Joe is cleared to fly. One episode shows Kenny also working at a fast food joint to supplement his meager income from Sandpiper.|$|E

500|$|In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two {{tower blocks}} in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only {{involved}} in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an [...] "anti-hero". The decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation, and a council spokesman said that [...] "There {{is no evidence that}} Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so we knew we were not naming the block after a murderer.... <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street." [...] In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.|$|E
500|$|Grace {{works closely}} with several allies during his time at All Souls, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> one of few people who is {{fully aware of the}} hospital's supernatural occurrences. He collaborates with RN Glory St. Claire, who has a long history with the {{facility}} and [...] "knows more than she can say or, at least, explain". She is characterized by her telepathic powers and older age. According to St. Claire, [...] "the dead have power" [...] in the hospital and the [...] "forces of good" [...] residing inside All Souls had foretold of Grace's arrival for several decades. She connects with Grace by holding his hands to allow him to see the [...] "tortured soul" [...] in the hospital. Grace finds further support from Dr. Nicole De Brae (Serena Scott Thomas), Dr. Bradley Sterling (Daniel Cosgrove), and Patrick Fortado (Adam Rodriguez). De Brae acts as the hospital's chief of staff and Sterling works alongside Grace as a medical intern. Fortado is Grace's close friend, a paraplegic who has great skill at hacking. The exact nature of De Brae's loyalty is called into question, with Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wondering if she will serve as a love interest or be revealed as one of the hospital's spirits. Other members of the medical staff include the psychologist Dr. Philomena Cullen (Reiko Aylesworth) and the orderly Joey (Christian Tessier).|$|E

2500|$|At {{the spring}} race, Busch {{got into an}} {{incident}} with former Penske teammate Brad Keselowski. On pit road, Keselowski slowed in front of Busch, trying to avoid Kasey Kahne. Busch did not slow down in time and rear-ended Keselowski, causing severe damage to the racecar. Keselowski was upset by the collision and criticized Busch {{in an interview in}} the garages. On lap 87, Keselowski and Busch encountered each other on the track with Keselowski over forty laps down and Kurt running in fourth place. Keselowski tried to retaliate by bumping Busch repetitively until NASCAR officials and Keselowski's boss Roger Penske told Keselowski to go to the garage and take a long time-out for his antics. Despite this altercation, Busch {{went on to win the}} race while Keselowski finished 39th. Post-race, Keselowski was quoted as stating, [...] "Kurt does good things for charity and is such a talent <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> dumbest racer." [...] Busch replied hours later in a media conference by calling Keselowski's retaliatory moves [...] "Punk-ass moves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Muhammad {{consented to}} the marriage, which by all {{accounts}} was a happy one. Khadija was not only Muhammad's wife, but also his friend and confidante and later his moral support. After his wedding, Khadija gave Muhammad the slave boy Zayd ibn Harithah. Ibn Ishaq records that Khadijah bore Muhammad six children: a boy named Qasim, who lived only two years, then four girls Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Um Kulthum, Fatimah and finally a boy named Abdullah, who also died at two. According to some Shi'a scholars, Fatimah was Muhammad's only daughter. The combination {{of the death of}} Abdullah, and his desire to relieve his uncle Abu Talib of the burden of a large family, as Abu Talib was already in great financial difficulty, led Muhammad to take his uncle's son Ali into his own home. Muhammad also adopted Zayd, giving him the name [...] "Zayd ibn Muhammad" [...] (meaning Zayd son of Muhammad). However, owing to the adoption revelation from Allah, later verses were revealed stating clearly that a child, especially after adoption, could not be treated as a natural son by marriage or inheritance. Consequently, the adopted child had to retain the name of his or her biological father. Therefore, Zayd could not be known as the son of Muhammad, but the son of his father, Haritha, and be known as Zayd ibn Haritha. In Quran : 33:40 40. Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Messenger of Allâh and the last of the Prophets. And Allâh is Ever All-Aware of everything.|$|E
