5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E
5|$|The French navy {{built the}} first ironclad to try to gain a {{strategic}} advantage over the British, but were consistently out-built by the British. Despite taking the lead {{with a number of}} innovations like breech-loading weapons and steel construction, the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy. In the 1870s, the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought took prominence, suggesting that torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of warships. Like the British, the French navy saw little action with its ironclads; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War was ineffective, as the war was settled entirely on land.|$|E
5|$|By 1909 {{the school}} library had 6,000 books valued at $3,500 and Ray D. Fisher was librarian. During November of that year the library {{received}} new furniture as Eaton Hall opened, and many departments were moved to it from Waller Hall. The library was re-cataloged in 1912 by Lucia Haley, a specialist from New York City hired by the school for this task. At that time the librarian was Dr. Lyle. Plans at this time called for constructing a building where the Art Building now stands {{to serve as a}} memorial to the pioneers of the university. This was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> home of the library, but the building was never built. In 1913, the librarian was Mary Field, and the collection was still about 6,000 volumes. Field was replaced the following year by Fannie J. Elliot.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, analog {{computers}} were considered by many to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of computing. These devices used the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved, in contrast to digital computers that represented varying quantities symbolically, as their numerical values change. As an analog computer does not use discrete values, but rather continuous values, processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence, as they can with Turing machines.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, the UK Government {{set up a}} {{committee}} to investigate the various systems of railway electrification; in 1921, it recommended that 1,500VDC overhead should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> national standard. Several schemes were implemented in its wake, but the Great Depression and World War II meant that very little work was done. Technological advances after 1945 meant that the 25kVAC system was adopted instead for the West Coast Main line and Glasgow suburban electrification (as {{set out in the}} BR 1955 Modernisation Plan). However, at the same time, large amounts of money had been (and were still being) spent converting several lines to 1,500VDC.|$|E

25|$|In a {{proposal}} to the Port of Portland, the west channel of the Willamette River next to Swan Island {{would have to be}} widened, and a dike built to keep high water out. The project extended its timeline in May 1926, forcing the USPS to keep using Pearson Airfield in Vancouver to deliver mail to the city. Most of the accommodations for the USPS at Swan Island Municipal Airport opened in September 1926, but commercial services were still being readied. The airfield only took-up a fraction of the land on Swan Island. The other areas were cleared and leveled so industrial growth could take place. During its construction, the Port of Portland requested that the Swan Island Municipal Airport <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> site of the Pacific Coast Air Derby, which was approved.|$|E
25|$|Augustus II {{counted on}} the Familias support {{regarding}} the Polish succession {{of his son}} Frederick Augustus, but as Louis XV of France married Marie Leszczyńska, the chances of her father, the former king of short duration Stanisław Leszczyński, kept increasing, until he gained the support of both magnate camps and of much of szlachta's rank and file. But the powers which surrounded the Commonwealth opposed both candidacies. In order to control the situation within their weak Polish neighbor they concluded several pacts, beginning in 1720 in Potsdam between Russia and Prussia, which culminated with the Treaty of the Three Black Eagles of 1732. This treaty involved also Austria and designated Infante Manuel, Count of Ourém of Portugal to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> king of Poland. Augustus II's last minute desperate machinations and schemes were interrupted by his death on February 1, 1733.|$|E
25|$|The HBC {{built a new}} {{much larger}} Fort Vancouver in 1824 {{slightly}} upstream of Fort Astoria {{on the north side}} of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Canada–U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in their trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.|$|E
