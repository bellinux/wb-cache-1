50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service <b>brake</b> <b>{{circuits}},</b> the parking <b>brake</b> <b>circuit,</b> and the trailer <b>brake</b> <b>circuit.</b> The dual service <b>brake</b> <b>circuits</b> are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both <b>circuits.</b> The parking <b>brake</b> is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 123). It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of the regrind stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration,</b> over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of closing the circuit had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations.</b> The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on the regrind circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage closed circuits in three concentrators, and surprisingly the closed circuit did not show any improvement over the open <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration</b> from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for regrind circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> and the I-stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration</b> proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration.</b> Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration...</b>|$|R
