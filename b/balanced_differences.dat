A former Westwood employee, Adam Isgreen, who was working for Petroglyph Games at the time, elaborated upon them in March and May 2007.

The [...] "loadout" [...] screen was finished in a prototype sequel to Tiberian Sun, codenamed Command & Conquer: Incursion, but Westwood was dissolved and Electronic Arts did not revive the concept. Drop-pods were intended to be customizable for GDI before deployment. Lighting was intended to {{make a huge difference}} for day/night play, as units spotted by light posts/towers would be susceptible to enemy fire at greater ranges, and in turn would suffer a reduction in their own range ability. Westwood planned the Hunter/Seeker Droid option to support selection of target types, but ultimately the droid was made to attack at random. Developers also didn't have enough time to finalize <b>balanced</b> <b>differences</b> in terrain types, or to make The Forgotten a full faction for the expansion, as it was initially intended.|$|E

(Sharda & Agrawal, 2012) In order to change that, major changes has to be made {{when it comes to making}} continuous improvements and to raise their standards regarding product availability and record inaccuracy (Wild, 2004). The purpose of this study is therefore designed to identify factors affecting the <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> and what impact it has on the efficiency of material flow. The demarcation of the work is that Atlas Copco has begun working with Lean and it will not be investigated nor the relationship between <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> and Lean. The study was based on answering the following questions: What influencing factors can be identified for <b>balance</b> <b>differences?</b> What factors are relevant to the efficiency of material flow? What kind of impact the <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> has on these factors? In order to answer the purpose and issues, a theoretical framework has been developed with help of literature studies and an analytical model. The model will be used to see how the company is related to the theory, from the analytical and from the analytical discussion impact factors will appear. The empirical part has emerged from interviews and observations of the case company. The result that has emerged through the study is that it is a lot of wasteful and unnecessary operations on a daily basis. This is the reason <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> and inefficacy occurs. Today there is no examination of how large or how often <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> occur. In order to solve the problems of the working routines, they must be strengthened and better follow-up must be done. The <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> has to be documented for the personnel to be able to go and do a follow up and investigate on why they occur. Therefore we conclude from this that the major influencing factor, both for the emergence of <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> and inefficient material flow is the human factor. Ignorance, carelessness and unnecessary procedures causes that Atlas Copco in Tierp has problems with <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> and inefficient material flow...|$|R

In the literature, all existing such functions are associated with the $d$-homogeneous property, and it was conjectured by Gong and Song that <b>difference</b> <b>balanced</b> functions must be $d$-homogeneous. First we characterize <b>difference</b> <b>balanced</b> functions by generalized difference sets with respect to two exceptional subgroups. We then derive several necessary and sufficient conditions for $d$-homogeneous <b>difference</b> <b>balanced</b> functions. In particular, we reveal an unexpected equivalence between the $d$-homogeneous property and multipliers of generalized difference sets. By determining these multipliers, we prove the Gong-Song conjecture for $q$ prime. Furthermore, we show that every <b>difference</b> <b>balanced</b> function must be balanced or an affine shift of a balanced function. Comment: 17 page...|$|R
40|$|Using the Wilson {{formulation}} of lattice gauge theories, a gauge invariant grid discretization of a one-particle Hamiltonian {{in the presence}} of an external electromagnetic field is proposed. This Hamiltonian is compared both with that obtained by a straightforward discretization of the continuous Hamiltonian by means of <b>balanced</b> <b>difference</b> methods, and with a tight-binding Hamiltonian. The proposed Hamiltonian and the <b>balanced</b> <b>difference</b> one are used to compute the energy spectrum of a charged particle in a two-dimensional parabolic potential {{in the presence of}} a perpendicular, constant magnetic field. With this example we point out how a "naive" discretization gives rise to an explicit breaking of the gauge invariance and to large errors in the computed eigenvalues and corresponding probability densities; in particular, the error on the eigenfunctions may lead to very poor estimates of the mean values of some relevant physical quantities on the corresponding states. On the contrary, the proposed discretized Hamiltonian allows a reliable computation of both the energy spectrum and the probability densities.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Postural {{instability}} and freezing of gait (FoG) are key features of Parkinson's disease (PD) which {{are closely related}} to falls. Although postural {{instability and}} FoG often co-occur, it is still unclear whether and how both symptoms overlap. To tackle this question, studies have investigated <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> between PD patients with and without FoG using two different approaches, i. e. clinical balance scales and posturography. The results from studies using posturography techniques are so far inconclusive. The effectiveness of clinical balance scales to distinguish between both groups has not yet been closely examined. Therefore, the current literature was reviewed to investigate whether clinical balance scales have sufficient discriminative power to detect <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> between freezers (FR) and non-freezers (NF). METHODS: PubMed was used to search for literature, based on the following search terms mentioned in the title and/or abstract: 'freezing of gait' or 'freezers' in combination with 'posture', 'postural', 'balance', 'stability'. Relevant articles were identified based on screening of titles, abstracts and full-texts. The search strategy was independently performed by two authors and ended on November 15 th 2016. A meta-analysis on balance scores of different clinical balance scales was conducted. RESULTS: Nine studies including 570 PD patients (247 FR, 223 NF) reported outcomes of clinical balance scales. A moderate amount of heterogeneity existed (I²= 37 %) between studies. Overall clinical balance scores were significantly lower in FR compared to NF (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0. 68; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 45 - 0. 90, p< 0. 00001). The Berg Balance Scale was found to be most effective to discriminate between FR and NF (SMD= 0. 53, 95 % CI: 0. 31 - 0. 75, p< 0. 00001) and showed the least amount of heterogeneity (I²= 0 %). The Mini-BESTest also significantly discriminated between groups (SMD= 1. 07; 95 % CI: 0. 44 - 1. 70, p= 0. 0008) as well as the BESTest (SMD= 1. 22; 95 % CI: 0. 73 - 1. 71, p< 0. 0001) and the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (SMD= 0. 69; 95 % CI: 0. 16 - 1. 22, p= 0. 01). Medication had some influence on the discriminative power. Heterogeneity between studies ON-medication was lower, but both ON- (SMD= 0. 57; 95 % CI: 0. 38 - 0. 76, p< 0. 00001) as OFF-medication (SMD= 1. 08; 95 % CI: 0. 31 - 1. 84, p= 0. 006) balance performance differed between FR and NF. CONCLUSIONS: This review illustrates that clinical balance scales are sufficiently sensitive to detect <b>balance</b> <b>differences</b> between PD patients with and without FoG, regardless of medication state. Due to the substantial heterogeneity and the rather small sample sizes, results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, we provide important evidence for more pronounced postural instability in patients with FoG, which is partially alleviated by medication indicating an involvement of both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic mechanisms. status: publishe...|$|R
