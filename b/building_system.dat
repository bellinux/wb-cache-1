25|$|In November 2009, Lego {{announced}} that production on new Bionicle sets would stop after a final wave {{would be released}} in 2010. Reasons that contributed included a loss in sales, a lack of new interest and a complicated back story with extended lore that put potential new consumers off. In mid-2010, Lego launched Hero Factory, a new theme marketed as a successor to Bionicle. It continued to utilize the <b>building</b> <b>system</b> introduced in its predecessor; eventually evolving into the new Character and Creature <b>Building</b> <b>System</b> (CCBS) which carried over into other Lego themes and eventually Bionicle's 2015 reintroduction.|$|E

25|$|To {{accompany}} the sets, Lego worked with Swinnerton and Advance {{to create an}} elaborate, original story featuring red herrings, arcs and extensive lore centering on characters made up of bio-mechanical components (half organic, half robotic) and telling it on a vast multimedia scale that would grow as the theme continued. As well as incorporating the same Technic <b>building</b> <b>system</b> used in Slizer/Throwbots and RoboRiders, uses of tropical environments and characters based on classical elements were also taken.|$|E
25|$|Between his {{sessions}} at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile mill, {{and later as}} a laborer in the meat-packing industry. He also served in the U.S. Navy in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a crash rescue boat commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett.

25|$|The <b>building</b> <b>system</b> {{boundary}} {{is split}} into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered (e.g. in buildings footprint, on-site or even off-site, see) respectively how many buildings {{are included in}} the balance (single building, cluster of buildings) and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses (e.g. heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, appliances, IT, central services, electric vehicles, and embodied energy, etc.). It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options.|$|E
500|$|IGN's David Smith offered {{praise for}} the voice actors and the {{innovations}} in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. They also felt that the game's graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game {{as a whole was}} [...] "the best-looking game of the series [...] arguably the best-playing as well". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clichés commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was [...] "diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game". Similarly, GamePro described its character <b>building</b> <b>system</b> and battle system as [...] "two of the best innovations in the series". The visuals of the game were commended by GameSpy's Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as [...] "top-notch", as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted most of them were [...] "above average" [...] and called the music [...] "rich".|$|E

Public schools and colleges must {{make the most of}} each available dollar. The combination of effective <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> master planning and purchasing standardization program management (PSPM) maximizes purchasing power. Proper <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> master planning helps owners get what they want from buildings with greater opportunity for success. Master planning yields benefits in budgeting, staffing, equipment, and opportunities for standardization. PSPM is a strategy utilizing the ?buy now-pay later? concept. Equipment is pre-selected and prepriced for projects as outlined in <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> master plans, and, frequently, in bond programs. Bulk purchasing and standardization, while normally thought of in reference to office and cleaning supplies, can also be applied to big-ticket items. The result is reduced first costs and a domino effect of other savings. Case studies will be presented from Texas school districts that demonstrate successful <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> master planning and PSPM programs.

2500|$|The Venetian Arsenal was not {{the mass}} {{production}} facility that {{it was to be}} until about 1320 with the creation of the Arsenale Nuovo. The Arsenale Nuovo was simply a larger and more efficient version of the original. [...] Prior to this time the Arsenal had served mainly as a place to maintain privately built ships. With the creation of the Arsenale Nuovo, and the development and introduction of the Great Galley, the Venetian Arsenal would start to take on its industrial form. The invention of the Great Galley itself is significant because they were able to be built frame-first. This process used less timber than the earlier hull-first <b>building</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in much faster build times. This was crucial to the process that would lead to the Arsenal becoming a mass-production center. By the 16th century, the Arsenal had become the most powerful and efficient shipbuilding enterprise in the world. Not only did it supply ships, rigging, and other nautical supplies, it was also a major munitions depot for the Venetian navy and was capable of outfitting and producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at the rate of one per day.|$|E
2500|$|The term cob {{is used to}} {{describe}} a monolithic <b>building</b> <b>system</b> based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of [...] "mud" [...] building {{have been used in}} many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form. [...] While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in Devon, England alone). [...] It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today. [...] Although typically associated with [...] "low-rise" [...] structures, in Yemen and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in [...] "apartment" [...] buildings of eight stories and more.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II, {{plastics}} {{became available}} in Denmark, and Lego purchased a plastic {{injection molding machine}} in 1947. One of the first modular toys to be produced was a truck that could be taken apart and re-assembled. In 1947, Ole Kirk and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft. These [...] "Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks" [...] were designed by Hilary Page. In 1939, Page had applied for a patent on hollow plastic cubes with four studs on top (British Patent Nº.529,580) that allowed their positioning atop one another without lateral movement. In 1944, Page applied an [...] "Improvement to Toy Building Blocks" [...] as an addition to the previous patent, in which he describes a <b>building</b> <b>system</b> based on rectangular hollow blocks with 2X4 studs on top enabling the construction of walls with staggered rows and window openings. The addition was granted in 1947 as British Patent Nº 587,206. In 1949, the Lego Group began producing similar bricks, calling them [...] "Automatic Binding Bricks." [...] Lego bricks, then manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed {{in the spirit of}} traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another but could be [...] "locked" [...] together. They had several round [...] "studs" [...] on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. They would stick together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart. In 1953, the bricks were given a new name: Lego Mursten, or [...] "Lego Bricks." ...|$|E
