5|$|Adams {{was born}} in <b>Boston,</b> {{brought up in a}} {{religious}} and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the <b>Boston</b> Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of <b>Boston</b> by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the <b>Boston</b> Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution {{at the expense of the}} colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 <b>Boston</b> Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution.|$|E

The second book, on clinical work he had done at <b>Boston</b> Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals.

Under those circumstances, Florida State would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to <b>Boston</b> College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against <b>Boston</b> College, and both Florida State and <b>Boston</b> College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E
