5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and <b>beech</b> <b>marten.</b> The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E

25|$|Mammalian {{carnivores}} {{can compete}} {{for some of}} the same prey as golden eagles but can also themselves become prey, the main prey family of carnivores being the canids (dog family). 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by golden eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed golden eagle nests. For the most part, foxes are the preferred prey, usually as juveniles though foxes of any age or condition, including adult male red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) heavier than the eagles themselves, may be hunted. Across much of both species' ranges, red fox co-exist with golden eagles and eagles hunt them in small numbers. Red foxes make up 13.5% of nest remains in Sicily and 5.9% in the Republic of Macedonia. In a nest in Mongolia, Corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) were surprisingly the main prey species, making up 38% of sampled remains. Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), swift fox (Vulpes velox), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the golden eagle's diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. Everything in this diverse family from least weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, have turned up as prey in golden eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the American marten (Martes americanus), pine marten (Martes martes) and <b>beech</b> <b>marten.</b> The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst wolverines, “young and inexperienced” specimens are usually targeted as prey by golden eagles. In North America, full-grown large mustelids, including American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska. Mustelids, mainly martens, turned up in large numbers in the French Alps where they made up 10.1% of nest remains.|$|E

2500|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.|$|E

50|$|In {{areas where}} the <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> is {{sympatric}} with the pine marten, the two species avoid competing with one another by assuming different ecological niches; the pine marten feeds on birds and rodents more frequently, while the <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> feeds on fruits and insects. There is however one case of a subadult <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> being killed by a pine marten. The <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> {{has been known to}} kill European polecats on rare occasions. Red foxes, lynxes and mountain lions may prey on adults, whereas juveniles are vulnerable from attack by birds of prey and wildcats. There is, however, one case from Germany of a <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> killing a domestic cat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> {{is mainly}} a crepuscular and nocturnal animal, though {{to a much}} lesser extent than the European polecat. It is {{especially}} active during moonlit nights.

40|$|Filaria martis {{causes a}} poorly known {{subcutaneous}} filariosis in mustelids. Few {{information is available}} about lesions that F. martis causes in <b>beech</b> <b>martens,</b> on its morphology, biology and the occurrence of the infection. From 1997 to 2006, 29 <b>beech</b> <b>martens</b> from two sites of southern Italy (Sites A and B) have been necropsied. Ectoparasites and nematodes were collected and morphologically identified. A variable region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) of F. martis has been characterised to compare females presenting caudal tips smooth without spines (i. e. Morphotype 1 -Mrph. 1) and with spines (i. e. Mrph. 2). All ticks collected were identified as Haemaphysalis erinacei. Eleven animals from Site A were found infected by F. martis nematodes in subcutaneous tissue in both membranous capsules or free under the inner skin surface. The most important morphological characters of F. martis have been reported and discussed.

50|$|Its {{most likely}} {{ancestor}} is Martes vetus, which also {{gave rise to}} the pine marten. The earliest M. vetus fossils were found in deposits dated to the Würm glaciation in Lebanon and Israel. The <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> likely originated in the Near East or southwestern Asia, and may have arrived in Europe by the Late Pleistocene or the early Holocene. Thus, the <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> differs from most other European mustelids of the Quaternary, as all other species (save for the European mink) appeared during the Middle Pleistocene. Comparisons between fossil animals and their descendants indicate that the <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> underwent a decrease in size beginning in the Würm period. Beech martens indigenous to the Aegean Islands represent a relic population with primitive Asiatic affinities.|$|E

50|$|Although the <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> is a {{valuable}} animal to the fur trade, its pelt is inferior in quality {{to that of the}} pine marten and sable. <b>Beech</b> <b>marten</b> skins on the fur markets of the Soviet Union accounted for only 10-12% of the market presence of pine marten skins. Beech martens were caught only in the Caucasus, in the Montane part of Crimea and (in very small numbers) in the rest of Ukraine, and in the republics of Middle Asia. Because animals with more valuable pelts are rare in those areas, the <b>beech</b> <b>marten</b> is of value to hunters on the local market.

40|$|Thelazia callipaeda infects {{the eyes}} of {{carnivores}} and humans in Far Eastern Asiatic and European countries. Studies have demonstrated the occurrence of T. callipaeda in foxes from areas where canine thelaziosis is endemic. However, there is little information {{on the role of}} wild carnivores as hosts of this nematode. From May 2003 to May 2009, a total of 130 carcasses of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; n= 75), wolves (Canis lupus; n= 2), <b>beech</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes foina; n= 22), brown hares (Lepus europaeus; n= 13), Eurasian badgers (Meles meles; n= 10), and wild cats (Felis silvestris; n= 8) were examined in an area of southern Italy where canine thelaziosis is highly prevalent. At necropsy, animals were examined and nematodes were collected from the conjunctival sacs of both eyes. All nematodes were morphologically identified and at least five specimens from each of the five host species were molecularly processed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox 1). Five out of the six wild animal species examined were found to be infected with eyeworms. The overall infection rate, excluding the Eurasian badgers that were all negative, was 39. 1 %. All the 189 adult nematodes collected (intensity of infection= 4 +/- 2. 2) were morphologically identified as T. callipaeda. The molecular analysis confirmed that the only haplotype of T. callipaeda circulating in Europe (i. e., haplotype 1) is present in that area. The competence of red foxes, wolves, <b>beech</b> <b>martens,</b> brown hares, and wild cats as definitive hosts for T. callipaeda is discussed in relationship to their ecology and their likely exposure to the vector Phortica variegata in the study area. The role the wild fauna plays in maintaining and spreading eyeworm infection in humans and domestic animals is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Eucoleus aerophilus (syn. Capillaria aerophila) is a trichuroid {{nematode}} affecting {{domestic and}} wild carnivores and, sometimes, humans. This parasite has a worldwide distribution and may cause significant clinical disease in pet animals. The present paper investigates the sequence variation in partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene of E. aerophilus isolates from pets and wild animals from different countries. Forty-four egg pools of E. aerophilus {{were collected from}} dogs, cats and foxes from Italy, while seventeen adult stages of E. aerophilus were obtained from red foxes and <b>beech</b> <b>martens</b> from Portugal, Romania, Serbia and UK. Fifteen different haplotypes were characterized and five were shared between pets in Italy and wildlife from Europe. The remaining haplotypes were either confined only in hosts or countries, or in a given host from a country. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all haplotypes clustered as a monophyletic group with a strong nodal support, indicating that all sequence types represented E. aerophilus. The results here presented have implications for {{a better understanding of}} the epidemiology, phylo-geography and clinical impact of E. aerophilus. In particular, the geographic distribution of E. aerophilus haplotypes in different host species and geographic regions, and their variation in terms of pathogenic impact and zoonotic role, warrant further investigations...|$|R
