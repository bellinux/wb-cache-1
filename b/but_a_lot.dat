25|$|The {{public sector}} effort {{continues}} {{with the goal}} to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled {{from all of this}} raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of hard work remains.|$|E

25|$|After {{finishing}} {{the work in}} middle school, she went to Putian high school. At this time, her mother finally accepted her studies because of her brilliant work in middle school and was happy with her accomplishments.However, she stayed in this school for only 1 year because of society’s situation. At that period, Japan started some small wars with China and killed many Chinese. A lot of students in this school were angry about that and held many parades to boycott Japan. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Japanese soldiers and spies stayed in China, so the parades were suppressed and some students were killed. Because of this, the study could not continue. So Lanying Lin transferred after one {{year in high school}} to a women’s school called Hami Lton School, which was founded by an American. One of her teachers came from American and could not speak Chinese very well, so many of her classmates could not understand his courses. Lanying helped the teacher as an assistant. So every time the teacher taught something in English, Lanying Lin would help to teach in Chinese. Because of this, she was called ‘little teacher’ by her classmates.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{forensic}} entomology became {{well known}} through {{the trial of}} David Westerfield in 2002 for the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam. In this San Diego case, the courtroom became a battle over conflicting reports from four forensic entomologists: David Faulkner, Neal Haskell, M. Lee Goff, and Robert D. Hall. A fifth scientist, William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist, also testified on this issue. Danielle had vanished from her bedroom the night of February 1–2; her partially decomposed body was found February 27. Haskell, Hall, and Faulker argued that forensic entomology established that the body of was dumped in mid-February, during which time Westerfield was already under police surveillance (since February 5), while Goff said the victim's body was colonized by larvae earlier than the other three entomologists estimated (his dates were February 9 to 14). His dates were earlier as he used new data from Canada which gives a significantly slower development for that fly species. Richard Merritt, a forensic entomologist and professor at Michigan State University, stated that because each scientist has his own method, {{this can lead to}} disagreement, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the disagreements involve a variation of one or two days, not over {{a week and a half}} as in the Westerfield case: “If it's that big a time, someone screwed up”.|$|E

500|$|In March 1970, the {{two houses}} reached a {{compromise}} whereby 150 million dollars would be {{struck in the}} 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities. The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, {{with the aid of}} Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as [...] "a lot less than the country deserves, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more than it appeared we would get". The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.|$|E

500|$|In February 2012 it was {{reported}} that Aston had left Time Team. He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about."

500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers– proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do {{we have to be}} 'supercrips' in order to be valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E

500|$|Amber Holcomb, a {{contestant}} of the 12th {{season of}} American Idol covered the song on April 10, 2013, during {{an episode of}} the show. Brian Mansfield of USA Today praised her performance writing that she was [...] "comfortable and confident and happy" [...] but added that in the end, the high melody of the song [...] "puts a little strain on her voice toward the end". That was somehow echoed by Bobby Olivier of The Star-Ledger who noted that the performance was [...] "pitchy, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun". However, he wrote that Holcomb [...] "seemed to struggle a little with {{keeping up with the}} melody" [...] and that her version was different from the original, but concluded that it was a solid performance.
