25|$|The first American <b>bandsaw</b> patent {{was granted}} to Benjamin Barker of Ellsworth, Maine, in January 1836. The first factory {{produced}} and commercially available <b>bandsaw</b> in the U.S. was by a design of Paul Prybil.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small {{portable}} sawmills {{consisting of a}} shop-size <b>bandsaw</b> mounted on a guiding table, which are called <b>bandsaw</b> mills (band saw mills, band sawmills). Like chain saw mills (a chainsaw on a guiding table), {{they can be used}} inexpensively by one or two people out in the field.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 40 {{years passed}} before Frenchwoman Anne Paulin Crepin devised a welding {{technique}} overcoming this hurdle. She {{applied for a}} patent in 1846, and soon afterward sold the right to employ it to manufacturer A. Perin & Company of Paris. Combining this method with new steel alloys and advanced tempering techniques allowed Perin to create the first modern <b>bandsaw</b> blade.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bandsaws</b> {{dedicated}} to industrial metal-cutting use, such as for structural steel in fabrication shops and for bar stock in machine shops, {{are available in}} vertical and horizontal designs. Typical band speeds range from 40 feet (12 meters) per minute to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) per minute, although specialized <b>bandsaws</b> are built for friction cutting of hard metals and run band speeds to 15,000 feet per minute. [...] Metal-cutting <b>bandsaws</b> are usually equipped with brushes or brushwheels to prevent chips from becoming stuck in between the blade's teeth. [...] Systems which cool the blade with cutting fluid are also common equipment on metal-cutting <b>bandsaws.</b> [...] The coolant washes away swarf and keeps the blade cool and lubricated.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bandsawing</b> is fast {{becoming}} the most preferred procedure for cutting-off standard workpieces owing to low kerf loss and high metal removal rates. One of the primary problems in evaluating metal <b>bandsaws</b> and developing newer variants, comprising of new saw tooth materials, their heat treatment, or different tooth forms and quality, has been costly and time consuming sawing tests. In order to overcome this, simulation work using a Single tooth test method previously developed was tested and validated. Cutting tests were performed at fine depths of cut (2 - 10 μm) usually found in actual <b>bandsawing</b> process...|$|R
2500|$|Almost all <b>bandsaws</b> {{today are}} powered by an {{electric}} motor. Line shaft versions were once common but are now antiques.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea of the}} <b>bandsaw</b> {{dates back}} to at least 1809, when William Newberry {{received}} a British patent for the idea, but bandsaws remained impractical {{largely because of the}} inability to produce accurate and durable blades using the technology of the day. Constant flexing of the blade over the wheels caused either the material or the joint welding it into a loop to fail.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluid {{may also}} {{take the form}} of a paste or gel when used for some applications, in {{particular}} hand operations such as drilling and tapping. In sawing metal with a <b>bandsaw,</b> it is common to periodically run a stick of paste against the blade. This product is similar in form factor to lipstick or beeswax. It comes in a cardboard tube, which gets slowly consumed with each application.|$|E
25|$|Blocks can be whittled {{with a hand}} knife, <b>bandsaw,</b> or Dremel carving {{tool for}} major shaping. Decals can be bought at scout shops or hobby shops. It is also {{possible}} to use standard model decals to replicate actual racing cars such as Richard Petty's 1970 Plymouth Superbird. The original style is based on open-wheel cars; however, fender or body kits are available, or wheels can simply be placed outboard of the body.|$|E
25|$|Power hacksaws (with {{reciprocating}} blades) {{were once}} {{common in the}} metalworking industries, but <b>bandsaws</b> and cold saws have mostly displaced them.|$|R
50|$|Concrete and masonry-cutting 'ring' saws are {{a form of}} disk cutter and are {{unrelated}} to <b>bandsaws.</b> They do however also use a diamond abrasive.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{workshops}} in residential garages or basements and in light industry contain small or medium-sized <b>bandsaws</b> that can cut wood, metal, or plastic. Often a general-purpose blade {{is left in}} place, although blades optimized for wood or metal can be switched out when volume of use warrants. Most residential and commercial <b>bandsaws</b> are of the vertical type mounted on a bench or a cabinet stand. Portable power tool versions, including cordless models, are also common in recent decades, allowing building contractors to bring them along on the truck to the jobsite.|$|R
25|$|The {{growth of}} the {{community}} saw {{the need for a}} chapel for the LDS ward. Alexander & Burton designed the building, and construction on the chapel began in 1938, handled by the construction firm of C. Bryant Whiting of nearby Springerville. The same red limestone as the schoolhouse was used for the chapel. Crude blocks were quarried, than transported to the site by horse-drawn wagons, where they were finished by local workmen, who were supervised by an Italian stonemason. Wood for the interior was supplied from Forest Service lands, a total of 150,000 board-feet was processed at a local sawmill owned by a Bishop of the LDS church. The milled arches at the front entry, along with other decorative elements were created using a wheeled <b>bandsaw.</b> Whiting completed the construction on time in the Spring of 1939, and came in under budget, costing less than $17,000. The first use of the structure was by the Relief Society, which held a meeting on April 30, 1939. With its larger meeting room, it replaced the schoolhouse as the community's meeting hall, as well as religious center.|$|E

2500|$|A resaw {{is a large}} <b>bandsaw</b> {{optimized}} for cutting timber along the grain to reduce larger sections into smaller sections or veneers. Resawing veneers requires a wide blade—commonly —with a small kerf to minimize waste. Resaw blades of up to [...] may be fitted to a standard <b>bandsaw.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bandsaws</b> in timber mills {{range in}} size from about (4" [...] x 22ga x 10') to (16" [...] x 11ga x 62') and can use any of the three main {{different}} saw band types: ...|$|R
2500|$|Timber mills use {{very large}} <b>bandsaws</b> for ripping lumber; they are {{preferred}} over circular saws for ripping {{because they can}} accommodate large-diameter timber and because of their smaller [...] (cut size), resulting in less waste.|$|R
50|$|The {{years from}} 1960 saw the company grow with the {{introduction}} of a range of machinery for the 'Do it yourself' market and educational training. The range included thicknessers, circular saws, planers, <b>bandsaws</b> and wood lathes.|$|R
2500|$|Advancements {{have also}} {{been made in the}} <b>bandsaw</b> blades used to cut metals. Bimetal blades with high speed steel teeth, {{including}} cobalt grades, are now the norm. The development of new tooth geometries and tooth pitches has produced increased production rates and greater blade life. New materials and processes such as M51 steel and the cryogenic treatment of blades have produced results that were thought impossible just a few years ago. New machines have been developed to automate the welding process of <b>bandsaw</b> blades as well.|$|E
2500|$|A {{vertical}} <b>bandsaw,</b> {{also called}} a contour saw, keeps the blade's path stationary while the workpiece is moved across it. [...] This type of saw {{can be used}} to cut out complex shapes and angles. [...] The part may be fed into the blade manually or with a power assist mechanism. [...] This type of metal-cutting <b>bandsaw</b> is often equipped with a built-in blade welder. [...] This not only allows the operator to repair broken blades or fabricate new blades quickly, but also allows for the blade to be purposely cut, routed through the center of a part, and re-welded in order to make interior cuts. [...] These saws are often fitted with a built-in air blower to cool the blade and to blow chips away from the cut area giving the operator {{a clear view of the}} work. [...] This type of saw is also built in a woodworking version. [...] The woodworking type is generally of much lighter construction and does not incorporate a power feed mechanism, coolant, or welder.|$|E
2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the <b>bandsaw,</b> I use a Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool does about the same job as a spokeshave -- it can take {{off a lot of}} wood very quickly -- but I can use it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E
50|$|Automatic <b>bandsaws</b> feature preset feed rate, return, fall, part feeding, {{and part}} clamping. These {{are used in}} {{production}} environments where having a machine operator per saw is not practical. One operator can feed and unload many automatic saws.|$|R
50|$|A featherboard is {{a safety}} device used {{when working with}} {{stationary}} routers or power saws such as table saws or <b>bandsaws.</b> The purpose of a featherboard is to apply pressure against a workpiece, keeping it flat against a machine table or fence.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of cold saw blades is increasing {{due to the}} technological advancements in cold saw machines. They are the sawing method of choice when high production requirements are needed. They consistently produce the lowest cost per cut among all sawing methods: hot sawing, friction sawing, <b>bandsawing</b> and hacksawing.|$|R
2500|$|The aircraft's design {{goals were}} low cost and {{simplicity}} of construction. Four design principles were employed: using {{the least expensive}} materials, using as little material as possible, keeping the design simple and utilizing as many common parts as possible. The resulting airframe is all-wood, with the major structural parts fabricated from Douglas fir. The tail and wing covering are birch. The wing and tailplane ribs are made in pairs from marine-grade fir plywood using a <b>bandsaw.</b> The wing spar is a hollow box for the first [...] from the root and then changes to a [...] "C-section" [...] outboard. Top surface spoilers are provided.|$|E
2500|$|In sawmills, a swage is used {{to flare}} large <b>bandsaw</b> or circle saw teeth, which {{increases}} {{the width of the}} cut, called the [...] A clamp attaches a mandrel and die to the tooth and the eccentric die is rotated, swaging the tip. A much earlier version of the same operation used a hardened, shaped swage die and a hand held hammer. Saw teeth formed in this way are sometimes referred to as being [...] "set". A finishing operation, shaping, cold works the points on the tooth sides to flats. It might be considered as a side swage. This slightly reduces the tooth width but increases the operating time between [...] "fittings". Swaging is a major advance over filing as the operation is faster, more precise and greatly extends the working life of a saw.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>bandsaw</b> (also written band saw) is a {{saw with}} a long, sharp blade {{consisting}} of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action {{as a result of}} an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. [...] Most bandsaws have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may have three or four to distribute the load. The blade itself can come in a variety of sizes and tooth pitches (teeth per inch, or TPI), which enables the machine to be highly versatile and able to cut a wide variety of materials including wood, metal and plastic.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the timbers {{would have}} been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more {{commonly}} <b>bandsawn,</b> and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.|$|R
2500|$|Head saws {{are large}} <b>bandsaws</b> {{that make the}} initial cuts in a log. [...] They {{generally}} have a [...] tooth space {{on the cutting edge}} and sliver teeth on the back. [...] Sliver teeth are non-cutting teeth designed to wipe slivers out of the way when the blade needs to back out of a cut.|$|R
50|$|The Meadow River Lumber Company, which {{operated}} in Rainelle, West Virginia from 1906 to 1975, {{was the largest}} hardwood sawmill in the world. It had three 9 ft <b>bandsaws</b> under one roof. In 1928, during peak production, its 500 employees produced 31 million board feet (73 thousand cubic meters) of lumber, cutting 3000 acre of virgin timber a year.|$|R
50|$|The first American <b>bandsaw</b> patent {{was granted}} to Benjamin Barker of Ellsworth, Maine, in January 1836. The first factory {{produced}} and commercially available <b>bandsaw</b> in the U.S. was by a design of Paul Prybil.|$|E
5000|$|He {{routinely}} {{used the}} <b>bandsaw</b> as a carving tool, standing a slab up on edge and slicing off long thin curves of wood in {{closer and closer}} approximation of the final desired form. [...] This risky procedure violates basic safety tenets of <b>bandsaw</b> use that insist that the stock must have a stable flat surface held firmly against the table. [...] He demonstrated his sanding and <b>bandsaw</b> techniques to other professional woodworkers at the Wood '79 conference held at SUNY Purchase, October 5-7, 1979.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} small {{portable}} sawmills {{consisting of a}} shop-size <b>bandsaw</b> mounted on a guiding table, which are called <b>bandsaw</b> mills (band saw mills, band sawmills). Like chain saw mills (a chainsaw on a guiding table), {{they can be used}} inexpensively by one or two people out in the field.|$|E
5000|$|A push stick, push shoe, or push {{block is}} a safety device used {{when working with}} {{stationary}} routers, jointers, or power saws such as table saws or <b>bandsaws.</b> [...] The purpose of a push stick {{is to help the}} user safely maneuver a workpiece, keeping it flat against a machine table or fence while it is being cut.|$|R
50|$|Power hacksaws {{are not as}} {{commonly}} used in the metalworking industries as they once were. <b>Bandsaws</b> and cold saws have mostly displaced them. While stationary electric hacksaws are not very common, they are still produced. Power hacksaws of the type powered by stationary engines and line shafts, like other line-shaft-powered machines, are now rare; museums and antique-tool hobbyists still preserve a few of them.|$|R
2500|$|Dual column saws have a pair {{of large}} columns, one {{on either side of}} the work, for very high {{rigidity}} and precision. [...] The dual column setup is unable to make use of a miter base due to inherent design. [...] Dual column saws are the largest variety of machine <b>bandsaws</b> encountered, to the point where some make use of a rotary table and X axis to perform complex cutting.|$|R
