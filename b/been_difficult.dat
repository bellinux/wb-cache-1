5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history that has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon {{bridge across the}} River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to {{the weight of a}} crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E

5|$|Libya's prompt retreat {{took many}} {{observers}} by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire {{to host the}} OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency.

5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, although it has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei {{rather than from the}} electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong has always <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> because {{the region has}} few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location would have <b>been</b> <b>difficult.</b> New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{protease}} {{targets of}} intracellular inhibitory serpins have <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to identify, {{since many of}} these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be {{to protect against the}} inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E

5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
