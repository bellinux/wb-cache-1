This research was a descriptive qualitative research. The design was embedded case study focusing on a single case. This research consists of two types of data source. The first data source was documents which involved source books and translated product. The second data source was collected from two validators who gave assessment about acceptability of translation. There were three categories of translation, acceptable: the scale 3, less acceptable: the scale 2, and inacceptable: the scale 1. Technique of collecting data was content analysis, reading technique and noting technique. The {{data were analyzed using}} equivalent method. The results of research show that from the total of 980 data, there were 8 translation technique types which were used by the translator in translating the book, that are literal technique, natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique,</b> calque technique, pure <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique,</b> reduction technique, adaptation technique, addition technique, and deletion technique. From those eight techniques, literal technique is the most dominant because from the data found, the translator used word by word in translating. It means that, if there was a word form in SL, then it would be translated into word and also for phrase and sentence. Based on the technique that dominantly appears, the translation tends to refer to SL Emphasis. Theoretically, the techniques tend to use literal technique, naturalized <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique,</b> pure <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique,</b> and calque technique which were based on source language. Therefore, the translation methods chosen by the translator were word for word, literal, and semantic. Then, the foregnization ideology tended to be used in this book because nursing terms include as particular and sensitive terms. So that the terms used still tend to source language oriented. Then, the impact of the application of those translation techniques toward the quality of acceptability of the translation was good enough. The acceptable category got the first rank than less acceptable and inacceptable, because the data found in this reseach were natural, smooth and flexible. It does not look like translation. Beside that, there was different assessment between validator I and validator II, because of different study background between them. The result of this research tended to refer to validator II, because she is more qualified in nursing field...|$|E

This study belongs to a qualitatif descriptive research. The research strategy applied {{in this study is}} an embedded case study. The data include words, phrases and sentences in the translation of the state address of the President of the Republic of Indonesia in 2006 which are written in Bahasa Indonesia and English (317 data), the translation experts’ statement about the accuracy and the English Native Speakers’ statement related to the acceptability and readibility. The data sources are informants and documents. Informants are the translators of the state address of the President of the Republic of Indonesia in 2006, key informants or translation experts and the English Native Speakers selected with purposive sampling technique. The documents refer to the state address of the President of the Republic of Indonesia in 2006 and its translation and all the statements taken from both translation experts and the English native speakers. The techniques for data collecting are questionnaire, in-depth interview and content analysis. The data validity is source and method triangulation.

A good CAC design for 4 G vehicular networks should be robust enough to support a vast range of hand-off rates. Most {{of the research on}} handling hand-off in vehicular networks are trying to use the mobility/traffic pattern to enhance the call admission process [5, 15, 16, 20 - 22]. In our work, we propose the channel borrowing idea which improves the channel utilization of conventional channel borrowing CAC schemes and therefore results in improved CBP while does not affect CDP. In Section 5, it will be shown that by applying our CAC scheme, the amount of improvement in CBP is considerable for a vast range of hand-off rates which motivates its application in 4 G vehicular networks. Moreover, we propose a mathematical system modeling and provide an analytical performance evaluation framework for the proposed channel <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E

The handoff events occur {{at a much higher}} rate in sectored cellular networks than in traditional cellular systems. An efficient bandwidth reservation mechanism for the neighboring cells is therefore critical in the process of handoff during the connection of multimedia calls to avoid the unwillingly forced termination and waste of limited bandwidth in the sectored cellular communications, particularly when the handoff traffic is heavy. In this paper, a self-adaptive bandwidth reservation scheme, which adopts support vector machines technique, is proposed to reduce the forced termination probability. Meanwhile, a channel <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique</b> is used to decrease the new call blocking probability of real-time traffic. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve superior performance than the representative bandwidth-reserving schemes in sectored cellular networks in the literature when performance metrics are measured in terms of the forced termination probability and the new call blocking probability...|$|E

It is aimed at finding out types of translation variations of English address term in the novel The Five People You Meet in Heaven and its translation, and also at finding out the translation technique that the translator applied to translate them. Documentation method was used in collecting the data. The data collected were analyzed by reading both versions of the novel. In doing the works, the translator translated English address terms into Indonesian address terms in several forms, since there are many kinds of address term to address someone. There are 305 address terms found in the novel The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom translated into Meniti Bianglala by Andang H. Sutopo. They consist of 210 (68. 85 %) of 305 address terms are translated {{in the form of}} pronoun, 12 (3. 95 %) of 305 address terms are translated in the form of kinship, 48 (15. 75 %) of 305 address terms are translated in the form of name, 18 (5. 90 %) of 305 address terms are translated in the form of title, and 17 (5. 55 %) of 305 address terms are translated in the form of endearment. There are also six techniques used by the translator in translating address terms of the novel The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom translated into Meniti Bianglala by Andang H. Sutopo. They consist of 5 (1. 6 %) of 305 address terms translated by applying amplification technique, 69 (22. 6 %) of 305 address terms translated by applying <b>borrowing</b> <b>technique,</b> 4 (1. 3 %) of 305 address terms translated by applying established equivalent technique, 178 (58. 4 %) of 305 address terms translated by applying literal technique, 13 (4. 3 %) of 305 address terms translated by applying reduction technique, and 36 (11. 8 %) of 305 address terms translated by applying transposition technique.
