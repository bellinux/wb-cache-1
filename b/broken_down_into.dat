5|$|The Transport Scotland Business Case for Borders Railway, {{published}} in November 2012, {{predicted that the}} total passenger return journeys made {{for the first year}} of operation would be 647,136.

5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E

5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one {{claimed the lives of}} more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E
5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, {{distinguished by}} {{the differences in}} antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the eighth series, Kryten's nanobots reconstruct the Red Dwarf, which they had <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship – including a pre-accident Rimmer – are resurrected, but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig (at first, for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten and Cat as stowaways, but later for using information from the confidential files). The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on Red Dwarf. The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (and promptly knees him in the groin and flees).|$|E
50|$|Tactical {{mobility}} can be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> firstly <b>into</b> agility, {{describing the}} tank's acceleration, braking, speed {{and rate of}} turn on various terrain, and secondly obstacle clearance: the tank's ability to travel over vertical obstacles like low walls or trenches or through water.|$|R

50|$|Commonly the FAS is <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> only <b>into</b> the College, the GSAS, and the Extension School. This {{is because}} the SEAS does not award earned degrees. Undergraduate {{concentrators}} and masters and doctoral students in the engineering and applied science departments instead receive their degrees from the College and GSAS, respectively.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> {{a number of major}} assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> 58 {{separate}} missions, of which there are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 18th century, two laws about {{chemical}} reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the law of conservation of mass, formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products). The second was the law of definite proportions. First proven by the French chemist Joseph Louis Proust in 1799, this law states that if a compound is <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> its constituent elements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.|$|E
