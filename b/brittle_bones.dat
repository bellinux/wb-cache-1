He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day {{progresses}} Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by [...] "Avian Bone Syndrome," [...] a result {{of which is that}} her purportedly <b>brittle</b> <b>bones</b> {{would not be able to}} stand such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz is on to her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz, who is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship.|$|E

40|$|Temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> {{disease is}} a {{recently}} described phenotype of increased fracture susceptibility {{in the first year}} of life in which there are multiple unexplained fractures without evidence of other internal or external injury. Most child abuse experts do not accept the existence of temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease and presume these cases are child abuse. The author reviewed 26 cases of infants with multiple unexplained fractures that fit the criteria of temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease and studied nine of them with either computed tomography or radiographic bone density measurements. The results show a striking association between temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease and decreased fetal movement, usually from intrauterine confinement, and low bone density measurements in eight of the nine infants. The association with decreased fetal movement and intrauterine confinement is in keeping with the mechanostat-mechanical load theory of bone formation. The author feels that temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> {{disease is a}} real entity and that historical information related to decreased fetal movement or intrauterine confinement and the use of bone density measurements can be helpful in making this diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Colin R Paterson 1, Elizabeth A Monk 21 Department of Medicine (retired), 2 School of Accounting and Finance, University of Dundee, Dundee, ScotlandBackground: In {{addition}} to nonaccidental injury, {{a variety of}} bone disorders may underlie the finding of unexplained fractures in young children. One controversial postulated cause is temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease, first described in 1990. Methods: Eighty-five patients with fractures showing clinical and radiological features of temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease were the subject of judicial hearings {{to determine whether it}} was appropriate for them to return home. Sixty-three patients did, and follow-up information was available for 61 of these. The mean follow-up period was 6. 9 years (range 1 &ndash; 17, median 6). Results: We found that none of the children had sustained any further injuries that were thought to represent nonaccidental injury; no child was re-removed from home. Three children had fractures. In each case there was general agreement that the fractures were accidental. Had the original fractures in these children been the result of nonaccidental injury, it would have been severe and repeated; the average number of fractures was 9. 1. Conclusion: The fact that no subsequent suspicious injuries took place after return home is consistent with the view that the fractures were unlikely to have been caused by nonaccidental injury, and that temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease is a distinctive and identifiable disorder.
