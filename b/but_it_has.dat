50|$|The Searchlight {{resulted}} in quick success, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> created a temporary momentum on Bengali rebels who started their insurgency from Barisal, a riverine city which the Army {{had failed to}} infiltrated. Therefore, Rear-Admiral Sharif's command was put in test when Sharif authorized the launch of Barisal which {{resulted in}} immediate success, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> no long-lasting effects.|$|R

5|$|Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a {{treatise}} on cabbage, which Pliny knew, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not survived.

5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried.

The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
