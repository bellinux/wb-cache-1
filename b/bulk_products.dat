5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for <b>bulk</b> <b>products</b> was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E

25|$|Growing freight {{levels and}} the {{importance}} to Melbourne and Victorian industry of freight efficiency. By 2035 the Port of Melbourne {{is expected to be}} handling more than four times the number of containers, {{more than three times the}} volume of Bass Strait trade, more than two-and-a-half times the number of new motor vehicles and double the quantity of <b>bulk</b> <b>products</b> compared with 2006 figures. About 80 per cent of port freight is transported by road. A 2006 Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission study also found the number of light commercial vehicles on Melbourne roads was growing faster than the rise in cars and trucks and that this growth affects congestion, especially around retail centres.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, a major {{target for}} {{investment}} was the [...] Dutch East India Company (VOC). The VOC encountered a rough patch around 1670, {{after a very}} profitable period {{up to that time}}. The causes were a price war for market share with the English East India Company after the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and an embargo on the export of precious metals (especially silver) by the Japanese Shogunate, which ended the profitable intra-Asiatic trade the company had conducted up to that time (this business of trade within the East-Asian market had financed the spice trade of the company up to that time, and obviated the need to export European silver and gold to pay for Asian commodities it imported in Europe). The VOC now opted for a policy of great expansion of its business, by branching out to Asian <b>bulk</b> <b>products,</b> like textiles, coffee, tea and porcelain. Other than the pepper and spices it had a near-monopoly on, these were high-volume low-profit commodities. The size of the company doubled in this period (making it the largest publicly traded company in the world at the time), but this was [...] "profitless" [...] growth that did not really solve the company's problems.|$|E

30|$|Current {{harmonized}} guidance {{dictates that}} the hold times for drug substance intermediates, <b>product</b> intermediates, and <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> are systematically established, {{but does not}} fully address the specific requirements for the bulk hold time stability study. The reason for this lack of flexibility is that the guidance definition of the date of manufacture is “the date when active ingredients are combined with other ingredients” for shelf life derivation. However, alternative methods of shelf life can be derived using “the date of stable intermediate being further processed for downstream process” instead of the date of manufacture. To be able to establish an alternative shelf life, stability studies that can establish sequential bulk hold times for drug substance intermediates, product intermediates, as well as <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> are required. This can be achieved during the development phase encompassing Phase I-III IND/CTA and NDA/WMA filing and the derived alternative shelf life methodology made applicable for later bulk manufacturing process.|$|R

When closed, it acts exactly like a butterfly valve and is tight. But when it is in rotation, the pockets allow to drop a defined amount of solids, which makes the valve suitable for dosing <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> by gravity.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of 24 {{buildings in the}} Greater Boston Area revealed that one-third (8 of 24) contained caulking materials with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content exceeding 50 ppm by weight, which is the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) specified limit above which this material {{is considered to be}} PCB <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> waste. These buildings included schools and other public buildings. In a university building where similar levels of PCB were found in caulking material, PCB levels in indoor air ranged from 111 to 393 ng/m 3; and in dust taken from the building ventilation system, < 1 ppm to 81 ppm. In this building, the U. S. EPA mandated requirements for the removal and disposal of the PCB <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> waste as well as for confirmatory sampling to ensure that the interior and exterior of the building were decontaminated. Although U. S. EPA regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act stipulate procedures by which PCB-contaminated materials must be handled and disposed, the regulations apparently do not require that materials such as caulking be tested to determine its PCB content. This limited investigation strongly suggests that were this testing done, many buildings would be found to contain high levels of PCBs in the building materials and potentially in the building environment. The presence of PCBs in schools is of particular concern given evidence suggesting that PCBs are developmental toxins...|$|R
