500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are <b>behind</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> you should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and employed John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. Commenting on the decision, she stated, [...] "I just {{wanted to get out of}} the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again." [...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him, stating, [...] "I've worked hard for my family. The problem comes, though, when others come in <b>behind</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> try to steal them away. The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson. Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride." [...] McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father." [...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting/production duo of James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Day" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Olaf Tyaransen of Hot Press called the song [...] "surprisingly straightforward but still infectiously catchy", while the magazine's Peter Murphy said the track broke the band's trend of releasing lead singles that broke new sonic ground {{but were not}} the best songs from their respective albums. Murphy called the song a [...] "patented U2 cavalry charge from U2 3 through The Joshua Tree to Jubilee 2000". The Guardian said the song [...] "strikes an appropriate note of putting the past <b>behind</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> getting on {{with the rest of}} your life". The review praised the track for its [...] "bustling beat", [...] "contagious chorus and vintage guitar chimes from Edge". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the track proof that the band's music had once again been [...] "graced by the glorious textures of Edge's guitar, and [...] Bono has dropped the masks". Rolling Stone called the song [...] "poised, then pouncing" [...] and said it was one of many from the album that has a [...] "resonance that doesn't fade with repeated listening". The Philadelphia Inquirer was critical of the song, saying it was not [...] "driven by the fire of true believers", but rather by the band's need for a hit, and that it was [...] "a move to solidify a base that may already have slipped away".|$|E
