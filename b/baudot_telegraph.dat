5000|$|Morkrum Model 11 Tape Printer - The Model 11 Typewheel Tape Printer, {{at about}} 45 words-per-minute, {{was a bit}} faster the Morkrum Printing Telegraph Blue and Green-Code printers, and was modeled after the European <b>Baudot</b> <b>Telegraph</b> System printer. The Model 11 was a Tape Printer which used gummed paper tape that could be pasted onto a {{telegram}} blank. This was the first teleprinter to successfully operate from an airplane.|$|E
5000|$|In 1874, the five-bit <b>Baudot</b> <b>telegraph</b> {{code and}} a {{matching}} 5-key chord keyboard {{was designed to}} be used with the operator forming the codes manually. The code is optimized for speed and low wear: chords were chosen so that the most common characters used the simplest chords. But telegraph operators were already using typewriters with QWERTY keyboards to [...] "copy" [...] received messages, and at the time it made more sense to build a typewriter that could generate the codes automatically, rather than making them learn to use a new input device.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Baudot</b> <b>telegraph</b> {{system was}} {{employed}} progressively in France, {{and then was}} adopted in other countries, Italy being the first to introduce it, in its inland service, in 1887. The Netherlands followed in 1895, Switzerland in 1896, and Austria and Brazil in 1897. The British Post Office adopted it for a simplex circuit between London and Paris during 1897, then used it for more general purposes from 1898. In 1900 it was adopted by Germany, by Russia in 1904, the British West Indies in 1905, Spain in 1906, Belgium in 1909, Argentina in 1912, and Romania in 1913.|$|E
5000|$|Jules Carpentier {{took care}} of the {{settings}} of the french engineer Emile <b>Baudot's</b> <b>telegraph</b> system of Posts and Telecommunications. Some devices regulators, translators and printers completed the system thanks to his work and his main collaborators. Thousands of installations [...] "Baudot" [...] were guided workshops to equip Jules Carpentier telegraph networks in France and many foreign countries.|$|R
40|$|Émile <b>Baudot’s</b> {{printing}} <b>telegraph</b> was {{the first}} widely adopted device to encode letters, numbers, and symbols as uniform-length binary sequences. Donald Murray introduced a second successful code of this type, the details of which continued to evolve until versions of Baudot’s and Murray’s codes were standardized as International Telegraph Alphabets No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. These codes were used for decades before the appearance of computers and the changing needs of communications required the design and standardization of a new code. Years of debate and compromise resulted in the ECMA- 6 standard in Europe, the ASCII standard in the United States, and the ISO 646 and International Alphabet No. 5 standards internationally.

50|$|<b>Baudot</b> invented his <b>telegraph</b> code in 1870 and {{patented}} it in 1874. It was a 5-bit code, {{with equal}} {{on and off}} intervals, which allowed telegraph transmission of the Roman alphabet, punctuation and control signals. By 1874 or 1875 (various sources give both dates) he had also perfected the electromechanical hardware to transmit his code. His inventions {{were based on the}} printing mechanism from Hughes' instrument, a distributor invented by Bernard Meyer in 1871, and the five-unit code devised by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber. Baudot combined these, together with original ideas of his own, to produce a complete multiplex system.|$|R
