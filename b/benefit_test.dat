40|$|Shepherd Shamu, 1 Simbarashe Rusakaniko, 1 Charles Hongoro, 2 1 Department of Community Medicine, College of Health Sciences, University of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe; 2 Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa Introduction: Health-care {{technologies}} (HCTs) play {{an important}} role in any country’s health-care system. Zimbabwe’s health-care system uses a lot of HCTs developed in other countries. However, a number of local factors have affected the absorption and use of these technologies. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that the net benefit regression framework (NBRF) could be a helpful <b>benefit</b> <b>testing</b> model that enables assessment of intra-national variables in HCT transfer. Method: We used an NBRF model to assess the benefits of transferring cost-effective technologies to different jurisdictions. We used the country’s 57 administrative districts to proxy different jurisdictions. For the dependent variable, we combined the cost and effectiveness ratios with the districts’ per capita health expenditure. The cost and effectiveness ratios were obtained from HIV/AIDS and malaria randomized controlled trials, which did either a prospective or retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. The independent variables were district demographic and socioeconomic determinants of health. Results: The study showed that intra-national variation resulted in different net benefits of the same health technology intervention if implemented in different districts in Zimbabwe. The study showed that population data, health data, infrastructure, demographic and health-seeking behavior had significant effects on the net margin benefit for the different districts. The net benefits also differed in terms of magnitude as a result of the local factors. Conclusion: Net <b>benefit</b> <b>testing</b> using local data is a very useful tool for assessing the transferability and further adoption of HCTs developed elsewhere. However, adopting interventions with a positive net benefit should also not be an end in itself. Information on positive or negative net benefit could also be used to ascertain either the level of future savings that a technology can realize or the level of investment needed for the particular technology to become beneficial.

40|$|Tests, as {{learning}} events, can enhance subsequent recall more than do additional study opportunities, even without feedback. Such advantages of testing tend to appear, however, only at long retention intervals and/or when criterion tests stress recall, rather than recognition, processes. We {{propose that the}} interaction of the <b>benefits</b> of <b>testing</b> versus restudying with final-test delay and format reflects not only that successful retrievals are more powerful learning events than are re-presentations but also that the distribution of memory strengths across items is shifted differentially by testing and restudying. The <b>benefits</b> of initial <b>testing</b> over restudying, in this view, should increase as the delay or format of the final test makes that test more difficult. Final-test difficulty, not the similarity of initial-test and final-test conditions, should determine the <b>benefits</b> of <b>testing.</b> In Experiments 1 and 2 we indeed found that initial cued-recall testing enhanced subsequent recall more than did restudying when the final test was a difficult (free-recall) test but not when it was an easier (cued-recall) test that matched the initial test. The results of Experiment 3 supported a new prediction of the distribution framework: namely, that the final cued-recall test that did not show a <b>benefit</b> of <b>testing</b> in Experiment 1 should show such a <b>benefit</b> when that <b>test</b> was made more difficult by introducing retroactive interference. Overall, our results suggest that the differential consequences of initial testing versus restudying reflect, in part, differences in how items distributions are shifted by testing and studying...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} how well the virtual psychophysical measures of spatial hearing from the preliminary auditory profile predict self-reported spatial-hearing abilities. Design: Virtual spatial-hearings tests (conducted unaided, via headphones) and a questionnaire were administered in five centres in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. Correlations and stepwise linear regression models were calculated among a group of hearing-impaired listeners. Study sample: Thirty normal-hearing listeners aged 19 - 39 years, and 72 hearing-impaired listeners aged 22 - 91 years with a broad range of hearing losses, including asymmetrical and mixed hearing losses. Results: Several significant correlations (between 0. 24 and 0. 54) were found between results of virtual psychophysical spatial-hearing tests and self-reported localization abilities. Stepwise linear regression analyses showed that the minimum audible angle (MAA) test was a significant predictor for self-reported localization abilities (5 % extra explained variance), and the spatial speech reception threshold (SRT) <b>benefit</b> <b>test</b> for self-reported listening to speech in spatial situations (6 % extra explained variance).

40|$|The {{proposed}} cartel between Air New Zealand {{was rejected}} by the NZ Commerce Commission, supported on appeal by the High Court. The case was an important and interesting application of the Net Public <b>Benefit</b> <b>test</b> in competition policy, under which the assessed costs or detriments of a determined substantial lessening of competition (SLC) are weighed against any offsetting benefits, for the purposes of authorisation. In this paper quantification of the detriments is shown to depend on the identity of those affected - consumers/producers; New Zealand/Australian/foreign. Impacts on the long-run performance of markets and on related markets were claimed and are evaluated. The basic legitimacy of the public <b>benefit</b> <b>test</b> in this context is assessed, in terms both of the purpose of the NZ anti-trust legislation and of the economics of long-term market performance.

Some critics have argued the Second Circuit’s decision last year in United States v. Newman demonstrates that the personal <b>benefit</b> <b>test</b> is unduly restrictive and should be reconsidered. Salman offers an opportunity for the Supreme Court to do so. This essay argues that Salman does not require the Court to reexamine the parameters of insider trading liability. Instead, the Court can affirm Salman {{on the basis of a}} simple principle: family is different. Specifically, the essay explains the reasons that tips to close family members provide a personal benefit to the tipper consistent with the Dirks test. As Justice Breyer observed at {{oral argument}} in Salman, “to help a close family member is like helping yourself. ” Dirks was motivated by an effort to provide sufficient predictability to enable market participants to search out information without undue fear of liability. The test has proved workable in practice – imposing liability in cases of insider self-dealing while constraining overreaching by government prosecutors. It is unnecessary to revisit this balance to affirm Salman’s conviction...|$|E
