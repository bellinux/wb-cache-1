40|$|In this work, {{we address}} the issues of image {{segmentation}} and boundary block padding involved in shape-adaptive image coding. Image segmentation helps to exploit human visual system (HVS) characteristics for <b>bit-rate</b> <b>reduction</b> in coding an image.

Segmentation algorithms considered are based on mathematical morphology tools. Following a brief discussion of the drawbacks of two reference segmentation algorithms, an improved edge detection, local-activity classification segmentation algorithm is proposed.

In order to code boundary blocks efficiently, an optimal block padding approach, which minimizes the norm of the corresponding transform coefficients, is proposed.

Compared to the HEVC non{{lossless coding}} mode {{with the smallest}} quantization parameter value (i. e., 0 for 8 -b video and − 12 for 10 -b video), the HEVC lossless coding mode provides perfect fidelity and an average <b>bit-rate</b> <b>reduction</b> of 3. 2 %– 13. 2 %. It also significantly outperforms the existing lossless compression solutions, such as JPEG 2000 and JPEG-LS for images as well as 7 -Zip and WinRAR for data archiving. To further improve the coding efficiency of the HEVC lossless mode, a sample-based angular intra prediction (SAP) method is presented. The SAP employs the same prediction mode signaling method and the sample interpolation method as the HEVC block-based angular prediction, but uses adjacent neighbors for better intra prediction accuracy and performs prediction sample by sample.

These sequences are characterized for depicting {{a mix of}} computer generated graphics, text, and camera-captured material. Such a mix poses several challenges, as the content usually depicts multiple strong discontinuities, which are hard to encode using current techniques. Differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) -based intra-prediction has shown to improve coding efficiency for these sequences. In this paper we propose sample-based edge and angular prediction (SEAP), a collection of DPCM-based intra-prediction modes to improve lossless coding of screen content. SEAP is aimed at accurately predicting regions depicting not only camera-captured material, but also those depicting strong edges. It incorporates modes that allow selecting the best predictor for each pixel individually based {{on the characteristics of}} the causal neighborhood of the target pixel.

40|$|Light field (LF) {{technology}} has been popularly adopted by {{a wide range of}} conventional industries. However, one problem when dealing with LFs is the sheer size of data volume. There have been many multi-view video coding (MVC) -based LF video coding methods reported in the literature, aiming at finding the best prediction structure for LF video coding. It is clear that the number of possible prediction structures is unlimited, and it is also observed that the coding bit-rate can be reduced by increasing the number of bi-directionally encoded views in the prediction structure. However, none work has been conducted to analyze the relationship of the prediction structure with its coding performance. In light of this observation, we first design a new LF-MVC prediction structure by extending the inter-view prediction into a two-directional parallel structure. Analytical models for source coding rate and encoding time are developed to analyze their relationships with the prediction structure, and are proven to be well-matched to our experimental results. Experimental evaluation of two LF video sequences demonstrates that the proposed LF-MVC prediction structure can achieve a factor of 26 % <b>bit-rate</b> <b>reduction</b> against the conventional MVC prediction structure for an LF video with 5 × 5 views, and a further 34 % <b>bit-rate</b> <b>reduction</b> for an LF video with a larger 10 × 10 views.
