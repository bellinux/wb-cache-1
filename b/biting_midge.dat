Also, due to the large area of the Midwest affected by this event, some rivers and tributaries took an abnormally long time to recede, with some areas remaining flooded for up to four weeks. The increased amount of standing water and flood-affected ground caused a summer-long increased population of <b>biting</b> <b>midge</b> gnats (sand flies), fungus gnats, flies, and mosquitoes, with the above-mentioned public health concerns.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> {{of the genus}} Culicoides, which are tiny nematoceran insects {{belonging}} to the Diptera, and their parasites. Biting midges partake in transmissions of several parasitical organisms of various groups. Most notably, they are the vectors of several pathogenic viruses which might have a serious impact on livestock. However, the thesis deals with detection of parasites belonging to Trypanosomatids and Filarioids related to two independent <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> collections - from the Czech Republic and from the Central African region. Apart from testing <b>biting</b> <b>midges,</b> there were carried out the tests on the occurrence of {{the same group of}} parasites within ruminant hoofed games in the Czech Republic. Our goal was to find out whether the same parasites occur with <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> and their hosts (hoofed games) and whether <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> could play a role as vectors. Biting midges are relatively overlooked group of haematophagous insects. Until recently, they had not been paid much attention, which changed with the spread of Bluetongue virus over Europe. This stimulated a widespread monitoring of <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> in several European countries, including the Czech Republic. This helped to gain a large amount of data about the occurrence of <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> near livestock. Nevertheless, there is no [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> are {{important}} vectors of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses in Europe. The introduction of these viruses highlighted {{the need to}} develop novel surveillance and control tools to monitor and manage <b>biting</b> <b>midges.</b> Biting midges, as most insects, primarily use olfactory cues to recognize and discriminate resources for their survival and reproduction. Blood feeding insects rely on host-derived volatiles to locate their vertebrate hosts, and these odours can be exploited to manipulate insect-host interaction. The primary goal of this thesis was to identify host volatiles that modulate the host-seeking behaviour of <b>biting</b> <b>midges.</b> Through coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analysis of odour collections from cattle hair and urine, I identified several compounds that, in combination with carbon dioxide, elicited behavioural attraction or inhibition in Culicoides nubeculosus, in a dose dependent manner. Some of these host odours were evaluated in the field showing similar behavioural responses of C. impunctatus. Both laboratory and field assays emphasized the importance of release rate to obtain optimal behavioural responses. The impact of using host volatiles to monitor host-seeking <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> was shown in another study. Here, I showed that incandescent light traps baited with two cattle kairomones, 1 -octen- 3 -ol and carbon dioxide, caught significantly more insects than UV light traps. UV light traps are to date the most commonly used method for monitoring <b>biting</b> <b>midges.</b> That said, differences were observed between trap types, both concerning species composition and the physiological state of the female <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> caught. Incorporating the novel bioactive compounds, formulated in blends and released in proper ratio and rate, could further increase the efficacy of this trapping method. By incorporating these attractants together with repellent compounds identified in this project, a "push-pull"- system for <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> could also be envisioned. The host volatiles identified are detected by the peripheral olfactory system of <b>biting</b> <b>midges.</b> A comparative analysis across biting species with different host preferences revealed a correlation between host preference and the number and types of antennal and maxillary palp sensilla. Functional characterisation of these sensillum types will be the next step to increase our understanding of how host odours are detected by <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> With this thesis I have increased our understanding of the chemical ecology of host-seeking female <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> and their peripheral olfactory system. Future research projects will need to develop viable commercial products that could be incorporated into management strategies for Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges.</b> ...|$|R

To {{determine the effect of}} these secretions on <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> and black flies, we set up a series of tests. First, we placed uropygial gland secretions from blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus broods inside empty nest boxes while empty nest boxes without gland secretions were treated as controls. Blue tit broods, from which we had obtained uropygial secretions, were affected by <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> and black flies. However, these insects were absent in nest boxes both with and without secretions from nestlings’ uropygial glands. We subsequently tested for the effects of uropygial gland secretions from feral pigeons Columba livia monitoring the number of <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> captured using miniature CDC traps.

Species of Culicoides have been found in almost {{all parts of the world}} and known to live in a variety of habitats. Several parasites and viruses are transmitted by Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> including Bluetongue virus and Schmallenberg virus. The aim of the present study was to determine the identity and diversity of blood meals taken from vertebrate hosts in wild-caught Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> near livestock farms. Results Biting midges were collected in weekly intervals for 20 weeks from May to October 2009. Twenty-four species of <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> were identified from four study sites within a small area in Denmark. A total of 111, 356 Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> were collected, of which 2, 164 were blood-fed. Specimens of twenty species were identified with blood in their abdomens. Blood meal sources were successfully identified by DNA sequencing from 242 (76 %) out of 320 Culicoides specimens. Eight species of mammal and seven species of bird were identified as blood meal hosts. The most common host species was cow which constituted 77 % of the identified blood meals. The second most abundant host species was common wood pigeon which constituted 6 % of the identified blood meals. Conclusions Our results suggest that some Culicoides species are opportunistic and readily feed on a variety of mammals and birds, while others seems to be strictly mammalophilic or ornithophilic.

Several parasites and viruses are transmitted by Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> including Bluetongue virus and Schmallenberg virus. The aim of the present study was to determine the identity and diversity of blood meals taken from vertebrate hosts in wild-caught Culicoides <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> near livestock farms. Methods Biting midges were collected at weekly intervals for 20 weeks from May to October 2009 using light traps at four collection sites on the island Sealand, Denmark. Blood-fed female <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> were sorted and head and wings were removed for morphological species identification. The thoraxes and abdomens including the blood meals of the individual females were subsequently subjected to DNA isolation. The molecular marker cytochrome oxidase I (COI barcode) was applied to identify the species of the collected <b>biting</b> <b>midges</b> (GenBank accessions JQ 683259 -JQ 683374). The blood meals were first screened with a species-specific cytochrome b primer pair for cow and if negative with a universal cytochrome b primer pair followed by sequencing to identify mammal or avian blood meal hosts.
