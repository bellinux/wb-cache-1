5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
500|$|Woo {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time in the second season as a client suing a Howard Stern-like talk show host named Wick. [...] She was suing because Wick's programs contributed to sexual harassment in her workplace. [...] Wick claimed Woo brought suit because she had a [...] "slutty little Asian thing going", and Woo said that she wanted to sleep with Wick <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did, she would kill him. The character proved to be a hit, and Liu was signed on as a regular for the series.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with {{numerous}} directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. India Hill of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "When Beyoncé does something, you listen. Not just because her lyrics are infectious and her beats are always catchy, but <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has something to say, you know it’s going to be important." [...] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian commented [...] "It is not an {{exaggeration to say that}} there is no other living musical artist who could ignite such a broad and unavoidable conversation just by releasing a new album – even a visual one, and it’s her second visual album – or who could turn an hour-long, visually narrative film for that album into a Saturday night watch-with-your-friends event on subscription cable channel." [...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms… I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love". In 2017, she released the controversial music video for [...] "Formation", which includes representations of racial injustice against African Americans in the United States during the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E

She decides that to top it all off she wants the perfect man - Ben Ridely, the owner of a leading property company. But she's too busy spending his money to realise that it's not coming in the legal way. Jodie needs to be careful <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> not she could end up in big trouble.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{the reports}} that Alfie would {{discover}} the affair, {{it was reported that}} several different storyline endings had been filmed, but that Wallace had been told the identity of Kat's lover, with a show source saying: [...] "The time felt right to finally tell Jessie, but she is still {{one of only a handful}} of people who knows the answer to the question on everyone's lips. [...] Lorraine [...] was adamant this story was going to stay quiet for as long as possible. She has done everything in her power to let it play out on screen with total secrecy behind the scenes. It's created a real buzz as everyone's been trying to figure out who Kat's been bedding. Up until now, none of the cast were in the know, not even her on-screen lover. It really has been that cloak and dagger. Richie revealed that Wallace had found not knowing the identity of Kat's lover [...] "frustrating" [...] but that she was [...] "torn between whether she wanted to know or not, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had known, she was frightened she might give it away by just a look", while Richie himself was happy not to know, [...] "because Alfie was in the same position", adding that both actors were [...] "happy to let it play out, though, because Kat flirts outrageously with all three Branning brothers, so we wanted the audience to make up their own minds about who the mystery lover was." ...|$|E

60|$|After tea Shirley reads, {{and she is}} {{just about}} as {{tenacious}} of her book as she is lax of her needle. Her study is the rug, her seat a footstool, or perhaps only the carpet at Mrs. Pryor's feet: there she always learned her lessons when a child, and old habits have a strong power over her. The tawny and lionlike bulk of Tartar is ever stretched beside her, his negro muzzle laid on his fore paws--straight, strong, and shapely as the limbs of an Alpine wolf. One hand of the mistress generally reposes on the loving serf's rude head, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> takes it away he groans and is discontented. Shirley's mind is given to her book. She lifts not her eyes; she neither stirs nor speaks--unless, indeed, it be to return a brief respectful answer to Mrs. Pryor, who addresses deprecatory phrases to her now and then.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{the fact}} was, {{that in the}} inmost {{recesses}} of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; {{but he had a}} strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to--and so forth.|$|E
60|$|The Gardens are bounded on {{one side}} by a never-ending line of omnibuses, over which Irene has such {{authority}} that if she holds up her finger {{to any one of}} them it stops immediately. She then crosses with you in safety to the other side. There are more gates to the Gardens than one gate, but that is the one you go in at, and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons, who sits just outside. This is as near to being inside as she may venture, <b>because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment, the balloons would lift her up, and she would be flown away. She sits very squat, for the balloons are always tugging at her, and the strain has given her quite a red face. Once she was a new one, because the old one had let go, and David was very sorry for the old one, but as she did let go, he wished he had been there to see.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2012 {{question}} and answer session on BBC Radio 5 Live Cocker said that he was having a conversation with the girl at the bar at college because he was attracted to her, although he found some aspects of her personality unpleasant. He remembered that at one point she had told him she [...] "wanted to move to Hackney and live like 'the common people'". Cocker used this phrase as the starting point for the song and embellished the situation for dramatic effect, for example reversing the situation in the song when the female character declares that [...] "I want to sleep with common people like you" [...] (Cocker admitted that in real life he had been the one wanting to sleep with the girl, while she had not been interested in him). Taking this inspiration, the narrator explains that his female acquaintance can [...] "never be like common people", <b>because</b> even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> gets a flat where [...] "roaches climb the wall" [...] ultimately, [...] "if she called her dad he could stop it all", in contrast to the true common people who can only [...] "watch their lives slide out of view".|$|R
