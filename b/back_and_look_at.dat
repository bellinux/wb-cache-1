500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the backspace key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you kind of have to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's {{pedigree}} includes horses {{adept at}} classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire [...] the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran {{second in the}} 2009 Kentucky Derby, {{with all of his}} wins at distances of [...] miles or more. Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with [...] "a big, long stride" [...] and had [...] "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." [...] He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: [...] "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." [...] To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: [...] "Every time I work him, I go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the pedigree, and I go, What is going on here?" ...|$|E
500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, game {{designer}} Josh Millard released Ennuigi. Ennuigi adds metafictional commentary to {{the original}} game since it relates the story of Luigi's inability {{to come to terms}} with the lack of narrative. In a Reddit thread, Millard commented [...] "I [...] think it's a pretty weird implied narrative once you step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, and enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all that into a recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who's as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you'd expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise." ...|$|E

"The {{guy who did}} {{the artwork}} for the first record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: so if you were to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then as we got more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{television}} show Roger Ebert & the Movies, director Martin Scorsese named Eyes Wide Shut his fourth-favorite film of the 1990s. For the introduction to Michel Ciment's Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Scorsese wrote: [...] "When Eyes Wide Shut came out {{a few months after}} Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that [...] or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since." [...] Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agreed. In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Romney has not {{put forward}} a clear {{statement}} {{as to whether he}} supports and would have signed, or would have opposed, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require that employers prove that differences in pay are based on qualifications, not gender, and extends the statute of limitations for filing claims of wage discrimination. The legislation was opposed by all but two Republicans in the House of Representatives and five in the Senate; {{and it was the first}} piece of legislation signed into law by President Obama. Asked in an [...] April 2012 interview if he would have signed the bill had it come before him as president, Romney said, [...] "It’s certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn’t there three years ago.... I’m not going to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don’t think there’s a reason to.” After the topic of equal pay for women was touched on during the second presidential campaign debate between Romney and Obama in October 2012, a top Romney campaign advisor told reporters that Romney was opposed to the passage of the bill at the time but had no plan to repeal it. The following day, the campaign adviser retracted his statement, saying that he was wrong when he said that Romney had been opposed to the act.|$|E

6000|$|Just {{when the}} man from Boston was {{beginning}} to tell me some more stories about first families, the Professor developed an unholy taste for hot springs, and bore me off to a place called Myanoshita to wash myself.

60|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} hardship in being an invalid {{is the fact}} that people come and see you and keep your spirits up. The Honorable Freddie Threepwood suffered extremely from this. His was not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain powers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors. All he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of Gridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling and think of nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{surprises me}} more," [...] said Foster, {{as they walked}} along, [...] "than to see such {{beautiful}} wells and fountains in streets so narrow that one actually has not enough room to step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them properly. Look at that one now, with the negress, the Moor, and the water-carrier waiting their turn while the little girl fills her water-pot. See what labour has been thrown away on that fountain. What elegance of design, what columns of sculptured marble, and fine tessellated work stuck up where few people can see it, even when they try to." ...|$|E

60|$|After Leduc had {{departed}} a silence fell between them, and endured some moments. His lordship was leaning forward, elbows on knees, {{his face in}} shadow. At length he sat <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his companion across the little intervening space.|$|R
60|$|I {{venture to}} suggest that we resist all this rubbish by the very simple test {{mentioned}} above. If there were anything intelligent in such art, something of it at least could be made intelligible in literature. Man is made with one head, not with two or three. No criticism of Rembrandt is as good as Rembrandt; but it can be so written as to make a man go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his pictures. If there is a curious and fantastic art, it is the business of the art critics to create a curious and fantastic literary expression for it; inferior to it, doubtless, but still akin to it. If they cannot do this, as they cannot; if there is nothing in their eulogies, as there is nothing except eulogy&mdash;then they are quacks or the high-priests of the unutterable. If the art critics can say nothing about the artists except that they are good it is because the artists are bad. They can explain nothing because they have found nothing; and they have found nothing because there is nothing to be found.|$|E
60|$|Manifold are the cares {{of wealth}} and state. Mr Dorrit's {{satisfaction}} in remembering {{that it had not}} been necessary for him to announce himself to Clennam and Co., or to make an allusion to his having had any knowledge of the intrusive person of that name, had been damped over-night, while it was still fresh, by a debate that arose within him whether or no he should take the Marshalsea in his way <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the old gate. He had decided not to do so; and had astonished the coachman by being very fierce with him for proposing to go over London Bridge and recross the river by Waterloo Bridge--a course which would have taken him almost within sight of his old quarters. Still, for all that, the question had raised a conflict in his breast; and, for some odd reason or no reason, he was vaguely dissatisfied. Even at the Merdle dinner-table next day, he was so out of sorts about it that he continued at intervals to turn it over and over, in a manner frightfully inconsistent with the good society surrounding him. It made him hot to think what the Chief Butler's opinion of him would have been, if that illustrious personage could have plumbed with that heavy eye of his the stream of his meditations.|$|E
60|$|Amyntas wandered slowly {{towards the}} village. Were his dreams {{to end in}} the herding of swine? What was this cavern of which the {{herdsman}} spoke? He felt a strange impulse to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dark opening between the little trees from which blew the cold wind.... But perhaps the rich man had a beauteous daughter; history is full of the social successes of swine herds. Amyntas felt a strange thrill as the dark lake came before his mind; he almost heard the lapping of the water.... Kings' daughters had often looked upon lowly swineherds and raised them to golden thrones. But {{he could not help}} going to look again at the dark opening between the little trees. He walked back and again the cold breath blew against his face; he felt in it the icy coldness of the water. It drew him in; he separated the little trees on either side. He walked on as if a hidden power urged him. And now the path became less clear; trees and bushes grew in the way and hindered him, brambles and long creeping plants twisted about his legs and pulled him back. But the wind with its coldness of the black water drew him on.... The birds of the air were hushed, and not one of the thousand insects of the wood uttered a note. Great trees above him hid the light. The silence was ghastly; {{he felt as if he}} were the only person in the world.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
