40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the work of}} Silvia <b>Ballestra,</b> Rossana Campo and Isabella Santacroce {{within the context of}} the so-called ‘pulp generation’ of writers who emerged in 1990 s Italy. My analysis addresses three main concerns of these writers: youth culture, gender, and literary legacies. The Introduction provides the methodological coordinates of my study, stating my initial aims, tracing the evolution of my interest in the writers and of my approach to their narratives, and outlining the structure of the thesis. Chapter 1 identifies themes and styles common to the ‘pulp generation’, referring to the work of, among others, Niccolò Ammaniti, Silvia <b>Ballestra,</b> Enrico Brizzi, Rossana Campo, Giuseppe Culicchia, Aldo Nove, Isabella Santacroce, Tiziano Scarpa and Simona Vinci. I focus on the critical reception of these writers and the support they received from the members of 1960 - 70 s avant-garde, Gruppo 63. In Chapter 2, I map out the links between the 1990 s writers and some of the authors who emerged in the 1980 s, and particularly Pier Vittorio Tondelli, teasing out similarities and differences between the two generations. The remaining three chapters are devoted to in-depth analyses of my three main writers, who have been selected for having already published a sizeable body of texts, for exhibiting a very distinctive evolution in themes, styles, and genres, and for having already acquired the status of ‘canonical’ writers of their generation. Chapter 3 on <b>Ballestra,</b> Chapter 4 on Campo, and Chapter 5 on Santacroce chart this evolution from their early postmodern fiction, dominated by youth themes and experimental language and structures, to more realist forms and mature themes of their later works, which combine a continued engagement with narrative form with a commitment to communication and with gender-oriented thematics. My investigation brings into relief the different treatment of these thematics and the styles adopted to convey them by the three authors. More importantly, it highlights the intertextual dialogue each one of them conducts with the tradition(s) of women’s writing, something that has been overlooked by critics in Italy and abroad. The Conclusion offers a brief sketch of the evolution of these three writers and of ‘pulp’ narrative in general. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores television-modeled {{narratives}} in Silvia Ballestra’s La guerra degli Antò, of 1992, and Aldo Nove’s Woobinda, of 1996. In so doing, {{it considers}} both {{the role of}} a text's author and the majority/minority reception practices that lead to its social imprint. For a definition of reception practices it turns to the work of media and reception scholars such as Henry Jenkins and Ien Ang. Employing a soap-operatic narrative and respecting the viewing practices of a minority viewer group, <b>Ballestra</b> navigates contemporary TV language to shape receptive communities within, and outside, of her text. Nove, in turn, models his work on majority group viewing habits to exploit and parody the homogenizing, and conversely isolating, effects of this language. In Woobinda authority lies with television, the medium of debased culture, while in La guerra degli Antò the narrator asserts her authority by adopting and mutating the codes of this same medium. Each text serves an important function, Nove’s text details the ultimate impasse of efforts to assert subjectivity, while Ballestra’s suggests a means of bypassing the impediments...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I analyse a {{selection}} of Italian pulp fiction from the 1990 s. My approach combines sociolinguistics and literary criticism, and uses textual analysis to show how this writing fuses influences from contemporary youth cultures and languages, and Italian literary tradition. The key themes of my analysis are pulp's multifaceted relationships with Anglophone culture, in particular punk music, its links to previous generations of Italian authors and intellectuals, and its engagement with contemporary Italian social issues. In Chapter 1, I review the existing literature on 1990 s Italian pulp. Following on from this, I outline how a primarily linguistic approach allows me to consider {{a selection of}} authors, such as Rossana Campo, Silvia <b>Ballestra,</b> Aldo Nove, Enrico Brizzi and Isabella Santacroce, from a unifying perspective, and how this approach offers a means of considering the varied but contemporary perspectives on Italian culture, society, politics and literature offered by this group of writers. In Chapter 2, I show how pulp authors construct their linguistic style {{on the basis of}} spoken youth language varieties, and consider their motivations for doing so. Chapter 3 traces the literary precedents for this use of language, using comparative textual analysis to examine the nature of the relationships between pulp and American literature, and late twentieth century Italian fiction by Arbasino, Tondelli and Pasolini, in order to question some of the myths surrounding the literary sources of pulp. Chapter 4 deals with the relationship between pulp and popular culture, contrasting the notion of popular culture presented in this fiction to that proposed by earlier generations of Italian intellectuals, and discussing the theoretical perspectives that this reveals. Finally, I debate the extent to which pulps often disturbing and controversial subject matter reflects an attempt to deal with ethical issues, and consider pulp's success in achieving these aims...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{representation}} {{of political and social}} issues in the work of a selection of contemporary Italian authors, aiming to assess what has become of the notion of political commitment ('impegno'), as debated by intellectuals in the sharply-defined political climate following World War II, and whether the institutional seizure then crisis of the 1980 s and 1990 s has encouraged a comparable literary response. In part one, I examine the critical works of Vittorini and Calvino, two authors central to the early discussion about the social role of literature, revealing the tensions between their conceptions of the relationship between writers and society, which, despite their close collaboration, are identifiable in their writings of the 1950 s and 1960 s. I then trace these different veins of thinking - which I have termed 'fault lines' in the solid mass of 'impegno' - into the works of Celati and Palandri, who express the socio-political consciousness of youth in the 1960 s and 1970 s. In the six chapters of the main body of my thesis, I consider the further breakdown, in the recent climate of political diffidence, of the traditional sense of commitment to a specific cause, into a fragmentary exposure of a variety of 'minority' issues in the work of individual authors or groups of the 1980 s and early 1990 s, broadly classifiable under the 'giovani narratori' label. This allows me to consider well-known contemporary authors, such as Tabucchi, De Carlo and Tondelli, from a specific perspective, alongside <b>Ballestra,</b> a young and little studied writer. My last two chapters discuss a selection of established women writers and barely-known African immigrant writers, assessing the impact of specific interest-groups on the 'impegno' question. I conclude by considering the specificity of these 'fragments' to Italian culture, within the general context of the postmodern lapse of faith in ideologies. </p...|$|E
