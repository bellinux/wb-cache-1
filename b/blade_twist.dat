40|$|A passive <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> {{control is}} {{presented}} in which the twist distribution of a tilt rotor blade is elastically changed {{as a function of}} rotor speed. The elastic twist deformation is used to achieve two different <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distributions corresponding to the two rotor speeds used on conventional tilt rotors in hover and forward flight. By changing the <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distribution, the aerodynamic performance can be improved in both modes of flight. The concept presented obtains a change in twist distribution with extension-twist-coupled composite blade structure. This investigation first determines the linear twists which are optimum for each flight mode. Based on the optimum linear twist distributions, three extension-twist-coupled blade designs are developed using coupled-beam and laminate analyses integrated with an optimization analysis.

The predictions of the rotor power by the empirical method are in good agreement with the test data and the CFD method, which verifies the application of present methods in analyzing helicopter performance. The analyses indicate that significant rotor power reduction can be achieved by decreasing rotor speed. It is not appropriate to decrease the rotor speed too much in high forward flight. More power reduction can be attained by varying rotor speed than by variable <b>blade</b> <b>twist.</b> The individual variation of rotor speed or <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> can reduce the rotor power by 17. 8 % or 10. 4 %, at a forward speed 250 km/h and weight coefficient of 0. 0065.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} benefits that fixed but deployable trailing-edge flaps may have on a low-twist hovering rotor using a blade-element method combined with two-dimensional and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics. Low <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> is beneficial in terms of forward-flight performance, which, combined with a deployable flap, could also offer good hover performance, resulting in an overall better design in comparison with a plain twisted blade. To evaluate this concept, a parametric study of flap configurations was conducted using a simple blade-element method based on computational-fluid-dynamics-generated two-dimensional aerodynamics. This simple model indicated that up to 6 deg of <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> could be recovered at high rotor thrust by using an optimized flap configuration. Performance improvements were also obtained for outboard slotted-flap configurations. The optimum slotted-flap designs were also evaluated using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics, which confirmed that an inboard flap combined with a low-twist (7 deg) rotor blade matched {{the performance of a}} plain blade with - 13 deg of twist.

Three blade geometries were studied, including a tilt rotor <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distribution (baseline), conventional helicopter rotor <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distribution, and the baseline twist distribution with 2 deg of precone. The results give insight into the delayed stall phenomenon often observed for highly twisted rotors. Calculations were performed for a high thrust condition near stall using the thin-layer Navier-Stokes CFD code TURNS. Effects of built-in twist on section force coefficients, skin friction, velocities, surface pressures, and boundary layer shape factor are discussed. Although the rotor thrust coefficient was nominally the same for the cases using the two twist distributions, large differences were found in the section in-plane and normal force coefficients. These preliminary results imply that the blade outboard region, rather than the inboard region, provides the majority of the performance advantage of the baseline case over the low twist case.

40|$|For optimal rotor {{performance}} in a tiltrotor aircraft {{the difference in the}} inflow and the rotor speeds between the hover and cruise flight modes suggests different <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> and chord distributions. The <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> rates in current tiltrotor applications are defined based upon a compromise between the figure of merit in hover and propeller efficiency in airplane mode. However, when each operation mode is considered separately the optimum blade distributions are found to be considerably different. Passive <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> control, which uses the inherent variation in centrifugal forces on a rotor blade to achieve optimum <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distributions in each flight mode through the use of extension-twist coupled composite rotor blades, has been considered for performance improvement of tiltrotor aircraft over the last two decades. The challenge for this concept is to achieve the desired twisting deformations in the rotor blade without altering the aeroelastic characteristics of the vehicle. A concept referred to as the sliding mass concept is proposed in this work in order to increase the twist change with rotor speed for a closed-cell composite rotor blade cross-section to practical levels for performance improvement in a tiltrotor aircraft. The concept is based on load path changes for the centrifugal forces by utilizing non-structural masses readily available on a conventional blade, such as the leading edge balancing mass. A multilevel optimization technique based on the simulated annealing method is applied to improve the performance of the XV 15 tiltrotor aircraft. A cross-sectional analysis tool, VABS together with a multibody dynamics code, DYMORE are integrated into the optimization process. The optimization results revealed significant improvements in the power requirement in hover while preserving cruise efficiency. It is also shown that about 21 % of the improvement is provided through the sliding mass concept pointing to the additional flexibility the concept provides for tailoring of the structure without any additional weight penalty on the system.

40|$|The present work {{analyses}} the aerodynamic complexities {{involved in}} the design of a coaxial rotor system in an attempt to maximize its performance in hover and forward flight. The aerodynamic methodologies of the simple momentum theory (SMT), the blade element momentum theory (BEMT), and a free vortex wake method (FVM) are used to help study this problem. It is shown that because of the inter-rotor aerodynamic interference effects, as well as the requirement of a torque balanced operating condition, the two rotors of the coaxial system generally operate at different thrust and different aerodynamic loadings. Therefore, for an optimally performing coaxial system, the geometric designs of the two rotors can expected to be different. To this end, parametric studies were performed to understand the effects of changes in inter-rotor spacings, <b>blade</b> <b>twist,</b> and blade planforms on both the upper and lower rotors. A more formal optimization was attempted by coupling FVM with an optimizer to find the best rotor geometry (if any) to maximize the figure of merit in hover or to minimize the total power required in forward flight. It was shown that the performance of the coaxial rotor system can, indeed, be improved significantly by having different blade geometries on the upper and lower rotors. However, it was also shown that the <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distribution has more significant effects on the rotor performance as compared to the blade planform shapes. The baseline geometry for all the optimization analyses had untwisted blades on both rotors. It was shown that a higher inter-rotor spacing is desired to reduce the interference effects between the two rotors in hovering flight. However, the spacing distance can be limited by the increased rotor weight and increased parasitic drag in forward flight. The results also show that a high <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> is desired on the upper rotor to reduce the induced losses of the coaxial system, whereas a high <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> on the bottom rotor increases the induced losses of the coaxial system. In forward flight, the results showed that at high advance ratios the aerodynamic interactions between the two rotors become smaller, and both rotors behave almost as isolated rotors. Parametric studies were also performed to study the effects of changing linear twist rates on both the rotors of the coaxial system in forward flight. The results showed that the total power required at an advance ratio of 0. 25 is insensitive to the changes in the <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> on upper and lower rotors. This outcome also showed that the optimum blade shapes obtained for hovering flight also offered better performance in forward flight...|$|E

The key design challenge is to maximize overall aerodynamic efficiency of the proprotor in both hover and forward flight, while preserving adequate stall margins for maneuvering flight and compressibility margins for high speed flight. To better assess proprotor performance, a new formulation of the blade element momentum theory for high-speed propellers and proprotors was developed. This approach uses an efficient and robust numerical method to solve simultaneously for the axial and swirl induced velocity components in the wake of the proprotor. The efficacy of the approach was validated against measurements of the performance of two NACA high-speed propellers at advance ratios up to 2. 5 and tip Mach numbers up to supersonic conditions. The importance of calculating accurately the swirl component of the induced velocity is emphasized. Parametric studies and design optimization studies were performed for different convertible-rotor aircraft platforms with the goal of developing a better understanding of the tradeoffs that would be needed for the development of advanced proprotors to power such convertible-rotor aircraft.
