25|$|When she was {{two years}} old, her father {{died in a car}} accident. Nine years later, while at a post office, an armed robber {{attempted}} to shoot a pregnant woman, but lost control of the gun after Shino <b>bit</b> <b>his</b> hand. Afterwards, she shot him three times, killing him. Since, she developed a fear of guns, entering panic attacks whenever one is visible. As a result, she is bullied at school by her peers, with a finger gun being enough to trigger her phobia. To help ease her trauma, her friend Kyōji Shinkawa convinced her to play Gun Gale Online. Known as Sinon ingame, her main weapon is the «PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II» sniper rifle, which she earned after defeating a monster in a dungeon.|$|E
25|$|For Uruguay's final group {{match against}} Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win {{to advance to}} the {{knockout}} stage while Italy only needed a draw. Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0–0, Suárez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Suárez lunged at Chiellini and <b>bit</b> <b>his</b> shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Suárez falling and clutching his face. The controversial incident made headline news around the world. As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez for not penalising Suárez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1–0 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.|$|E

He suffered from severe head trauma, underwent three surgeries at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, California, including a six-hour brain surgery, and contracted meningitis. He recovered, and Mansfield's attorney Sam Brody sued the theme park on the family's behalf for $1,600,000 ($ in [...] dollars). The negative publicity led to closure of the theme park.|$|E

We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off and go into the Hudson. But he just rose a little <b>bit,</b> <b>his</b> altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom! He disappears into the Trade Center." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he <b>bit</b> <b>his</b> tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she <b>bit</b> <b>his</b> fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E

Fawcett was asked whether he thought the bishop had actually read the Origin of Species. [...] "Oh no, I would swear he has never read a word of it", Fawcett reportedly replied loudly. Wilberforce swung round to him scowling, ready to recriminate, but stepped back and <b>bit</b> <b>his</b> tongue on noting that the protagonist was the blind economist.
