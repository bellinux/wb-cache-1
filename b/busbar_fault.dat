40|$|The inverse {{definite}} {{minimum time}} lag (IDMTL) overcurrent (OC) and earth fault (EF) protection {{are the main}} {{as well as the}} backup protection in the industrial power system. They are also responsible for clearing the <b>busbar</b> <b>fault.</b> If the protection system is not properly coordinated, the incorrect sequence of relay operations to clear the <b>busbar</b> <b>fault</b> will result in excessive outage in the industrial supply system. The time coordination method (TCM) can help to solve the protection relay setting coordination problem. It can systematically search out the optimum protection relay settings disregarding the relay operating principles. This paper shows that correct backup protection operations can also improve the supply reliability. The supply reliability influenced by the protection relay operations on the unclear fault is calculated. The results show that the protection relay settings coordinated by TCM in the industrial supply system can achieve higher supply reliabilityDepartment of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn radial {{distribution}} network with no discontinuities in feeders' impedances {{the shape of}} traveling wave induced by an SLG fault inception will be modeled by multiple refractions and reflections from <b>busbar,</b> <b>fault</b> and loads. The initial propagation zone presents a rigorous polarity disposition of residual currents, with sound residuals having the same polarity. We can determine the minimal sampling frequency necessary to get in that zone the current data indicating faulty feeder. The initial polarity length {{does not depend on}} the fault position, its resistance value or on the soil resistivity, and if scrutinized on all feeders it can point out from busbar to fault in systems with laterals. The propagating waves can thus be involved in directional procedures in lines or in cables. Under certain conditions the directional function can be assumed also in mixed networks, with feeders partly in cables and partly in lines...|$|E

Tzoneva Co-supervisor: Prof. P. Petev 2013 Busbars {{are the most important}} components in the distribution networks. Faults on the busbar are uncommon, however an occurrence of a <b>busbar</b> <b>fault</b> can lead to a major loss of power. Busbars are the areas in a substation where the levels of current are high and therefore the protective relay application is very critical. In order for the protection scheme to be successful it is important to carry out the following specifications: Selectivity, Stability, Sensitivity, and Speed. To meet all of the above requirements protection must be reliable, meaning that the protection scheme must trip when called up to do so (dependability) and it must not trip when it’s not supposed to (security). The thesis focuses on the reverse blocking busbar protection scheme with aim to improve the speed of its operation {{and at the same time}} to increase operational reliability, flexibility and stability of the protection during external and internal faults by implementation of the extended functionality provided by the IEC 61850 standard-based protective IEDs. The practical implementation of the scheme by the use of IEC 61850 standard communication protocol is investigated. The research analyzes in detail the reverse blocking busbar protection scheme that is used at the moment in the power systems and it develops an improved IEC 61850 based reverse blocking busbar protection scheme for a distribution network. The proposed scheme is designed for a radial type of a distribution network and is modeled and simulated in the DigSILENT software environment for various faults on the busbar and its outgoing feeders. The results from the simulations are used further for implementation of the designed protection scheme. A laboratory test bench is build using three compliant with the IEC 61850 standard ABB IEDs 670 series, CMC 356 Omicron test injection device, PC, MOXA switch, and a DC power supplier. Two ways of the reverse blocking signals between the IEDs implementation are considered: hard wired and Ethernet communication by using IEC 61850 standard GOOSE messages. Comparative experimental study of the operational trip response speed of the two implementation shows that the performance of the protection scheme for the case of Ethernet communication is better The thesis findings and deliverables will be used for postgraduate studies of other students, research, short courses, and solution of industrial problems.

40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{modeling}} and simulation of a supply vessel from a static and dynamic perspective in an integrated way. Modern marine vessels with electric propulsion {{are becoming more and}} more complex systems. Therefore, there is a strong necessity to develop models capable to integrate different subsystems in order to evaluate the overall performance under faults conditions, harsh weather and other critical situations. In particular, the focus of the work is to highlight the need to implement zonal protection scheme to respect DP 3 (Dynamic Position 3) constraints in case of severe <b>busbar</b> <b>faults,</b> operating the system with the main tie breaker closed. The model developed is characterized with a complete representation of a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV). The model represents also the full protection system (static and dynamic) in accordance to fine-tuning conducted on the real system. In this work, the innovative contribution is the investigation of the shortterm dynamics after a <b>busbar</b> <b>faults</b> with a detailed electric model of the full network taking into account zonal power system protections and load shedding actions. The work is also focused on representing the electromechanical model of the propulsion power converters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a long-run incremental cost pricing (LRIC) model {{that reflects the}} cost caused by the changes of the circuit breakers utilisation levels in the network. The pricing focuses on evaluating the costs of advancing the circuit breakers' upgrade consequent upon the Distributed Generator (DG) connection. In this paper, the impact to the future circuit breaker reinforcement is assessed by the connection of a new DG to different study nodes in the system. The new connection would increase fault currents throughout the network, and the magnitude of increase differs for DGs connecting at different locations. The nodal LRIC charges {{for the use of}} circuit breakers are the sum of the impact to each <b>busbar's</b> <b>fault</b> current with and without the connection of new DG. The principle and implementation of the long-run pricing model is demonstrated on IEEE 14 busbar system with varying DG locations and fault current growth rates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} rapid detection of faults on VSC multi-terminal HVDC transmission networks using multi-point optical current sensing. The proposed method uses differential protection as a guiding principle, and is implemented using current measurements obtained from optical current sensors distributed along the transmission line. Performance is assessed through detailed transient simulation using Matlab/Simulink® models, integrating inductive DC-line terminations, detailed DC circuit breaker models and a network of fiber-optic current sensors. Moreover, the feasibility and required performance of optical-based measurements is validated through laboratory testing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protection algorithm can effectively, and within {{very short period of}} time, discriminate between faults on the protected line (internal faults), and those occurring on adjacent lines or <b>busbars</b> (external <b>faults).</b> Hardware tests prove that the scheme can be achieved with the existing, available sensing technology...|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetic}} core fault current limiter (MFCL) saturated by a dc biasing coil {{was designed and}} implemented, both experimentally and in PSCAD/EMTDC simulation package. The operation of the device under normal operating conditions and faults was then studied. A case study was carried out using simulation to demonstrate {{the application of the}} proposed MFCL. The benefits of using a grid-connected single-phase rectifier to bias the dc coil of the MFCL were investigated through simulation studies. The simulation results show improvements in limiting the fault current and minimizing the voltage sag on healthy <b>busbars</b> during a <b>fault.</b> It was also found that the highest improvements are achieved when the rectifier is connected to the downstream grid...|$|R
