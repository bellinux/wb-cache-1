5|$|HDMI 1.3 was {{released}} on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (10.2Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, {{in addition to the}} Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> up to 340 MHz.

5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their garbage rooms, of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations.

5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon.

Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> by easyJet airline company.|$|E
5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{three weeks}} after commissioning, Bismarck left Hamburg to begin sea trials in Kiel Bay. Sperrbrecher 13 escorted the ship to Arcona on 28 September, {{and then on to}} Gotenhafen for trials in the Gulf of Danzig. The ship's power-plant was given a {{thorough}} workout; Bismarck made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were <b>being</b> <b>tested,</b> a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that Bismarck could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. Bismarcks main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; Bismarck returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.|$|E
