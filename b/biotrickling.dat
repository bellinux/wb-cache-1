40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{periodically}} rotating <b>biotrickling</b> filters {{was developed for}} parallel operation of multiple bench scale <b>biotrickling</b> filters without the requirement for expensive equipment such as liquid recycle pumps and air flow regulation. The performance of 20 identically operated rotating <b>biotrickling</b> filters was reproducible with an average toluene elimination capacity of 79. 4 g m- 3 h- 1 (stand. dev. = 5. 7) at an empty bed residence time of 45 s and a toluene inlet gas phase concentration of 1. 6 g m- 3. At gas and liquid cocurrent operation, the toluene elimination capacity of rotating <b>biotrickling</b> filters was 20 % higher than at countercurrent operation. This was probably caused by greater mass transfer limitation resulting from increased wetting of the biofilm during countercurrent operation. Performance versus load curves of rotating and of conventional <b>biotrickling</b> filters were comparable with non-zero order removal at toluene inlet concentrations lower than 2 g m- 3. This multiple rotating <b>biotrickling</b> filters setup provides a new and inexpensive tool for comparative studies in <b>biotrickling</b> filtration for air pollution control...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} simulation of the removal of hydrophilic compounds using <b>biotrickling</b> filtration was developed. The model takes into account that <b>biotrickling</b> filters operate by using an intermittent spraying pattern. During spraying periods, a mobile liquid phase was considered, while during non-spraying periods, a stagnant liquid phase was considered. The model was calibrated and validated with data from laboratory- and industrial-scale <b>biotrickling</b> filters. The laboratory experiments exhibited peaks of pollutants in the outlet of the <b>biotrickling</b> filter during spraying periods, while during non-spraying periods, near complete removal of the pollutant was achieved. The gaseous outlet emissions in the industrial <b>biotrickling</b> filter showed a buffered pattern; no peaks associated with spraying or with instantaneous variations of the flow rate or inlet emissions were observed.

Wet biomass for-mation in 23. 6 -L reactors over a 77 -day period was reduced from 13. 875 kg in a control <b>biotrickling</b> filter to 11. 795 kg in a <b>biotrickling</b> filter enriched with protozoa. The average toluene vapor elimination capacity at 1 g/m 3 toluene and 64 m 3 /(m 3 ? h) was 31. 1 g/(m 3 ? h) in the con-trol and 32. 2 g/(m 3 ? h) in the <b>biotrickling</b> filter enriched with protozoa. At higher toluene inlet concentrations, toluene degradation rates increased and were slightly higher in the <b>biotrickling</b> filter enriched with protozoa. The lower rate of biomass accumulation after the addi-tion of protozoa was due to an increase of carbon min-eralization (68 % as compared to 61 % in the control). Ap-parent biomass yield coefficients in the control and en-riched trickling filter were 0. 72 and 0. 59 g dry biomass/g toluene, respectively. The results show that protozoan predation may be a useful tool to control biomass in <b>biotrickling</b> filters, however, further stimulation of preda-tion of the biomass immobilized in the reactor is required to ensure long-term stability of <b>biotrickling</b> filters. © 199...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} in bakery exhaust gases {{was identified as a}} high priority problem by the American Bakers Association in conjunction with their member companies. <b>Biotrickling</b> filter technology was evaluated among other approaches and was selected for a pilot study to control ethanol emissions from a bakery oven exhaust gas stream. Biofilters and <b>biotrickling</b> filters use microbial populations in biofilms that grow on support media to degrade or transform contaminants in the air. The <b>biotrickling</b> filter employed in the pilot study used a synthetic fibrous support media to immobilize the biofilm. A pilot study was conducted from September 1997 to February 1998, to assess the performance of <b>biotrickling</b> filter technology in treating organic emissions from bakery ovens. Bench-scale studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the support media and develop initial estimates of <b>biotrickling</b> filter performance. Pilot studies were performed with USEPA’s trailer mounted two-stage <b>biotrickling</b> filter system, at flowrates in the range of 1. 8 - 3. 0 standard cubic meters per minute (65 - 104 standard cubic feet per minute). Removal efficiencies in the range of 80 % to 100 % were measured experimentally, and averaged 91 % over the duration of the study. The pilot-scale biofilter produced removal efficiencies exceeding 80 % for about 99. 6 % of its operating time. The pressure drop across the bed was less than 6. 4 millimeters (0. 25 inches) of water. The test further revealed that the <b>biotrickling</b> filter was quite robust; it responded quickly to changes in inlet concentration and exhibited a recovery time of less than 150 minutes after a nine day shutdown period.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} operation of <b>biotrickling</b> filters for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) removal, shock loads or starvation was common due to process variations or equipment malfunctions. In this study, effects of starvation and shock loads {{on the performance}} of <b>biotrickling</b> filters for H 2 S removal were investigated. Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the changes of biomass and viable bacteria numbers in the <b>biotrickling</b> filters during a 24 -d starvation. Compared to biomass, viable bacteria numbers decreased significantly during the starvation, especially when airflow was maintained in the absence of spray liquid. During the subsequent re-acclimation, all the bioreactors could resume high removal efficiencies within 4 d regardless of the previous starvation conditions. The results show that the re-acclimation time, in the case of <b>biotrickling</b> filters for H 2 S removal, is mainly controlled by viable H 2 S oxidizing bacteria numbers. On the other hand, the <b>biotrickling</b> filters can protect against shock loads in inlet fluctuating H 2 S concentration after resuming normal operation. When the <b>biotrickling</b> filters were supplied with H 2 S at an input of lower than 1700 mg/m 3, their removal efficiencies were nearly 98 % regardless of previous H 2 S input...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} the {{construction}} of an actual 8. 7 -m 3 pilot/ full-scale <b>biotrickling</b> filter for waste air treatment is de-scribed and compared with a previous conceptual scale-up of a laboratory reactor. The reactor construction costs are detailed and show that about one-half of the total reactor costs ($ 97, 000 out of $ 178, 000) was for personnel and engi-neering time, whereas ~ 20 % was for monitoring and con-trol equipment. A detailed treatment cost analysis demonstrated that, for an empty bed contact time of 90 sec, the overall treatment costs (including capital charges) were as low as $ 8. 7 / 1000 m 3 air in the case where a nonchlorinated volatile organic compound (VOC) was treated, and $ 14 / 1000 m 3 air for chlorinated compounds such as CH 2 Cl 2. Com-parison of these costs with conventional air pollution con-trol techniques demonstrates excellent perspectives for more field applications of <b>biotrickling</b> filters. As the spe-cific costs of building and operating <b>biotrickling</b> filter reac-tors decrease with increasing size of the reactor, the cost benefit of <b>biotrickling</b> filtration is expected to increase for full technical-scale bioreactors.

40|$|A set of {{bench scale}} <b>biotrickling</b> filters were {{designed}} and operated for simultaneous treatment of graywater and waste containing {{elevated levels of}} ammonia (NH 3) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize graywater processing in the reactors. While surfactants have been considered to be readily biodegradable, removal of carbon from graywater was {{not as high as}} expected during preliminary experiments when no waste gas was supplied to the system. Removal efficiency was not improved after several modifications to reactor design and it was hypothesized that complete removal of surfactants and their relevant biodegradation metabolites was a challenge. Therefore, surfactant biodegradation was studied in detail. Experimental work showed that while all three surfactants exhibited rapid primary biodegradation, biodegradation of by secondary byproducts was very slow. In the case of the amphoteric surfactant, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, biodegradation byproducts seemed to be recalcitrant. A mathematical model was developed to describe the <b>biotrickling</b> filter processes and this model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis so that governing processes within the <b>biotrickling</b> filter could be determined. Important design parameters were elucidated as well as parameters inherent to the system, or intrinsic parameters. Results showed that an increase in wetted area within the <b>biotrickling</b> filter could significantly improve process performance. Therefore, a set of tracer test experiments was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} packing material and hydraulic loading rate on hydrodynamics in the bench scale <b>biotrickling</b> filters.

40|$|Biological {{treatment}} is an emerging {{technology for the}} treatment of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) off-gases. Most of POTWs off-gases contain H 2 S and a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since co-treatment of odors and VOCs in <b>biotrickling</b> filters is a relatively unexplored area, the simultaneous biotreatment of H 2 S and toluene (as the model VOC) was investigated. The experimental setup included two identical <b>biotrickling</b> filters, one operated at pH 4. 5 and the other one was operated at pH 7. 0. High concentrations of H 2 S (up to 170 ppmv) and toluene (up to 2. 2 g m− 3) were supplied to determine the influence of the pH on the maximum performance. A rapid startup (a few days) was observed for both toluene and H 2 S removal in the neutral-pH <b>biotrickling</b> filter. In the acidic <b>biotrickling</b> filter, toluene degradation also started immediately but at a lower rate. However, after several weeks of operation, the toluene elimination capacity (EC) at low pH reached a steady value identical to this found in the neutral-pH <b>biotrickling</b> filter. H 2 S did not affect toluene degradation at concentrations up to 170 ppmv at either pH. At a volumetric load of 100 m 3 m− 3 h− 1, maximum elimination capacities of 70 g toluene m− 3 h− 1 (at 1. 7 g m− 3 toluene) and 20 g H 2 S m− 3 h− 1 (at 170 ppmv H 2 S, the highest concentration tested) were observed.

The maximal DMS elimination capacity at 90 % removal efficiency of HBF 1 was 7. 2 g m− 3 h− 1 after 30 days of operation. The elimination capacity decreased, however, when the inlet loading rate exceeded 15 g m− 3 h− 1 (200 ppmv inlet concentration).

Microbial community analysis with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed very different microbial communities in both <b>biotrickling</b> filters (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0 %).

In this research, a <b>biotrickling</b> filter was designed and operated to remove this pollutant from an air stream using bacteria extracted from the sewage sludge of a municipal sewage-treatment plant. The bacteria were cultured and enriched by either petri dish’s cultivation or liquid cultivation. The adsorption capacity of the ceramic material, which was used as the packing material, was determined to be 34 g-NO/L under 37 ℃. However, the saturated adsorption capacity of the packing material with the recycling solution is 236 mg-NO/L under the operation temperature 37 ℃. The result suggested that the microporous structure of the ceramic material not the humidity is the main contributor to the ceramic material adsorption capacity. Both the ceramic material adsorption capacity and the removal capacity of the liquid were limited and saturated in 540 min and 2 min operation, respectively. To obtain the best operation conditions for the <b>biotrickling</b> filter, orthogonal experiments (L 9 (34)) were designed. The experimental data were analyzed by the signal to noise (S/N) ratio and ANOVA. The optimal conditions of the <b>biotrickling</b> filter occurred at a temperature of 40 ℃, a pH of 8. 0  0. 05 and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 165 mg/L in the recycled water with no oxygen in the system.

The DNA sequencing of four clones of bacteria showed 93 - 98 % similarity to Pseudomonas mendocina strain. This strain has been analysed by full gene sequencing and proved to be a brand-new strain named as Pseudomonas mendocina DLHK. This strain can transfer nitrate to organic nitrogen. This result indicated the assimilation nitrogen process in this system and suggested that the main nitrogen removal capacity in this system was through biological function. Through the isotope experimental analysis, two intermediate products (15 NO and 15 N 2 O) have been found during the biological process of the system by using quantitative gas analysis (QGA). These results indicated the denitrification function in this <b>biotrickling</b> filter. A model was developed to explain the biological process in the <b>biotrickling</b> filter. The averaged error of the measured and modeled data is - 0. 047. The standard deviation of the error is 0. 039.

The communities were monitored by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the 16 S rRNA region. After inoculation with activated sludge, the <b>biotrickling</b> filters were operated using inlet loads (ILs) from 20 to 65 gCm− 3 h− 1 and empty-bed residence times (EBRTs) from 14 to 160 s. Removal efficiencies higher than 80 % were obtained with ILs up to 35 gCm− 3 h− 1 working at EBRTs as low as 24 s. There was an increase in the total percentage of the target domains of up to around 80 % {{at the end of the}} experiment. Specifically, the Gammaproteobacteria domain group, which includes the well-known volatile organic compound (VOC) -degrading species such as Pseudomonas putida, showed a noticeable rise in the two <b>biotrickling</b> filters of 26 % and 27 %, respectively. DGGE pattern band analysis revealed a stable band of Pseudomonas putida in all the samples monitored, even in the lower diversity communities. In addition, at similar operational conditions, the <b>biotrickling</b> filter with a greater relative abundance of Pseudomonas sp. (19. 2 % vs. 8 %) showed higher removal efficiency (90 % vs. 79 %).

40|$|Polluted air streams can be {{purified}} using biological treatments such as <b>biotrickling</b> filtration, {{which is}} one of the most widely accepted techniques successfully tuned to treat a wide variety of exhausted gaseous streams coming from a series of industrial sectors such as food processing, flavor manufacturers, rendering, and composting. Since the degradation of a pollutant occurs at standard pressure and temperature, <b>biotrickling</b> filtration, whether compared with other more energy-demanding chemical-physical processes of abatement (such as scrubbing, catalytic oxidation, regenerative adsorption, incineration, advanced oxidation processes, etc.), represents a very high energy-efficient technology. Moreover, as an additional advantage, biodegradation offers the possibility of a complete mineralization of the polluting agents. In this work, <b>biotrickling</b> filtration has been considered in order to explore its efficiency with respect to the abatement of ammonia (which is a highly water-soluble compound). Moreover, a complete mathematical model has been developed in order to describe the dynamics of both absorption and biological activities which are the two dominant phenomena occurring into these systems. The results obtained in this work have shown that the absorption phenomenon is very important in order to define the global removal efficiency of ammonia from the gaseous stream (particularly, 44...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{pilot plant}} fed by a 600 -Nm 3 h− 1 waste {{air flow rate}} {{consisted}} of a water scrubbing pre-treatment followed by a <b>biotrickling</b> filter and a biofilter, in series. The growth of selected bacterial and fungal consortia was promoted through the <b>biotrickling</b> filter and biofilter. Total BTEX levels were detected in a raw waste air stream at an average concentration of 39. 07 mg Nm− 3. The whole treatment achieved an average of 96. 1 % removal efficiency. This performance led to very low average concentrations of individual BTEX in the final air effluent: 1. 07 mg Nm− 3 for benzene, 0. 16 mg Nm− 3 for toluene, 0. 22 mg Nm− 3 for ethylbenzene and 0. 07 mg Nm− 3 for xylene (mix). The performance and stability of both <b>biotrickling</b> filter and biofilter confirmed {{the effectiveness of the}} treatment in achieving low concentrations of individual BTEX in the final air effluent, which fully comply with the most stringent toxicological standard and threshold odor concentrations, for the protection of workers and local residents. This result was possible by the complementary and synergistic action of the bacterial and fungal consortia in degrading BTEX...|$|E
40|$|Odour from {{agricultural}} activities, such as {{the spreading}} of manure and the housing of animals, is increasingly being considered a nuisance in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the odour removal from pig house exhaust air by a <b>biotrickling</b> filter that had been implemented for ammonia abatement. At a regular pig production farm, the performance of a running full-scale <b>biotrickling</b> filter was studied for 72 days. Ammonia and odour removal efficiency were on average 79 % and 49 % respectively. Ammonia removal appeared to be based on an unintended accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in the system, instead of on production and discharge of nitrate. The odour removal efficiency showed a large variation that, for a major part, about 80 %, could be attributed to actual changes in the performance of the <b>biotrickling</b> filter. These changes were probably caused by variations in the composition of the air that were not completely reflected by the olfactometrically measured odour concentration, as the many different components that make up the odour each have different removal characteristics. It seemed that the <b>biotrickling</b> filter was operated below its maximum absolute odour removal capacity [OUE/(m(3) filter) /s], which means that the absolute odour removal will probably rise at increasing load. It was, however, not possible to distinguish between the influence of either the odour load or the odour concentration on the odour removal, because of a positive correlation between the odour concentration and the air flow. To increase the odour removal efficiency (%), the design of the filter probably needs to be optimised for both well and poorly water-soluble odour components...|$|E
40|$|Odour control, <b>biotrickling</b> filter, {{scrubbers}} Odour nuisance {{has become}} a major environmental issue worldwide with increasing public demand for better control of odorous emissions from municipal wastewater treatment facilities, chicken farms, chemical plants and other industrial works. Odour annoyance affects the population directly and there is a trend that {{more and more people are}} becoming less tolerable with obnoxious odour emissions. Bad smell is often regarded as an indicator for possible health risks. In Singapore, much investment has been placed on the prevention of nuisance odour emissions from all the public-owned wastewater treatment plants and continuing research has been put into the development of better and more cost-effective odour control procedures. The local authorities have invested significantly in covering up their existing waste treatment process units and treating all captured sewage air by a variety of technologies such as chemical scrubbers and activated carbon towers. Recently, a new <b>biotrickling</b> filter technology was developed and trial tested at a local wastewater plant and results from the past 3 years of operation indicate an extremely cost-effective biological way of treating sewage odour. Singapore’s odour control experience from the use of the traditional chemical and activated carbon systems to this latest <b>biotrickling</b> filter technology is discussed and presented here...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} rapidly assess the eciency of chemical washing {{for the removal of}} excess biomass from <b>biotrickling</b> filters for waste air treatment. Although the experiment was performed on a small scale, conditions were chosen to simulate application in full-scale <b>biotrickling</b> filters. From 18 treatments with dierent combinations and concentrations of chemicals, only washing with 0. 4 % (w/v) NaOH, 0. 26 and 1. 31 % (w/v) NaClO and 11. 3 % (w/v) H 2 O 2 resulted in a biomass removal significantly higher than treatment with pure water with wet biomass removal eciencies of 50. 2, 49. 2, 77. 0 and 69. 0 %, respectively. Biomass removal by H 2 O 2 and NaClO was accompanied by complete loss of activity of unremoved biomass, whereas after treatment with NaOH low residual bio-logical activity was observed. However, treatment with NaOH resulted in generation of relatively large amounts of suspended solids (22. 3 % of dry biomass removed) and dissolved carbon (65. 3 % of C-bio-mass removed). NaClO was found to be the most promising reagent for biomass control in <b>biotrickling</b> filters because of its ability to remove large amounts of biomass and its low cost. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Removal of {{hydrogen}} sulfide from waste and energy-rich gases is required, {{not only because}} of environmental health and safety reasons, but also because of operational reasons if such gases have to be used for energy generation. A <b>biotrickling</b> filter for the removal of ultra-high concentrations of H 2 S from oxygen-poor gases is proposed and studied in this work. Two laboratory-scale <b>biotrickling</b> filters were used to study the startup period and to determine the long-term performance of the gas sweetening process. The inlet H 2 S concentration ranged from 900 to 12000 ppmv and two different packing materials were investigated. There was no toxicity effect observed even at a the highest H 2 S concentration, and maximum elimination capacities of 280 and 250 g H 2 S m 3 h 1 were obtained at gas contact times of 167 and 180 s, respectively. Elemental sulfur and sulfate were found to be the most abundant end-products of the biological oxidation of sulfide when operated under microaerophilic conditions. The <b>biotrickling</b> filter was able to quickly recover its nominal performance after different load increases and system shutdowns simulating field operation. The results reported here show that biotreatment can be an interesting alternative to conventional gas sweetening systems normally used for such applications.
