40|$|In {{order to}} offer {{scientific}} bases {{for the application}} of oil <b>bodies</b> <b>from</b> peanut in food, this research was undertaken to study the size and charge stability of oil <b>bodies</b> <b>from</b> five peanut varieties. It showed that the mean diameter of oil <b>bodies</b> <b>from</b> yuhua 9719 and yuhua 9830 is obviously larger than yuhua 23, yuhua 27, and yuhua 9502 in the peanut cell. Moreover, the analysis of diameter distribution of oil bodies also showed that the median diameter of oil bodies increased dramatically in the order of yuhua 9719 > yuhua 9830 > yuhua 23 > yuhua 27 > yuhua 9502 after aqueous extraction. The charge stability of oil <b>bodies</b> <b>from</b> peanut was observed with zeta (ζ) potential measurements, which indicated that charge properties and the absolute value of oil <b>bodies</b> <b>from</b> five peanut varieties were significantly affected by pH and salt concentration, but the degree of influence is different. Of the five peanut varieties, yuhua 27 and yuhua 9830 possessed excellent charge stability (ζ-potential > 35 [*]mV) in neutral microenvironment without salt concentration...|$|R
5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on {{one part of the}} body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the <b>body</b> <b>from</b> acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E

Żółkiewski was buried in St Lawrence Church in Żółkiew (now Zhovkva, Ukraine), the town he enlarged and where he built the Żółkiew Castle.|$|E

5|$|After this defeat, Wetherby {{moved to}} Franklin County and secured a {{position}} at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent, Bill May. From 1964 to 1966, he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution. In 1965, May backed Wetherby in his campaign for the Kentucky Senate. He won the election, defeating the candidate favored by Chandler, and was chosen president of that <b>body</b> <b>from</b> 1966 to 1968. He was so effective in this position that the state's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing {{by a vote of}} 31–5 in virtually the same form as it was presented.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public <b>body</b> <b>from</b> doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} the liberation {{of the human mind}} from the {{dominion}} of religion; the liberation of the human <b>body</b> <b>from</b> the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government.

5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the <b>body</b> <b>from</b> ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Ljotić's {{body was}} removed from the tomb in which it was buried. Two {{theories}} exist about what happened to it. One claims it was removed by Ljotić's followers and taken to an unknown location following the creation of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947. The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers removed his <b>body</b> <b>from</b> the tomb in which it was buried and took it to an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, possibly to Italy.|$|E

5|$|His {{funeral was}} {{one of the largest in}} the South. Davis was first entombed at the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. In 1893, Mrs. Davis decided to have his remains reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. After the remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly {{organized}} Louisiana Historical Association, with many mourners passing by the casket, including Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. The body was placed on a Louisville and Nashville Railroad car and transported to Richmond, Virginia. A continuous cortège, day and night, accompanied his <b>body</b> <b>from</b> New Orleans to Richmond. He is interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.|$|E
5|$|His next {{event was}} the 2008 Four Continents, where he placed {{second in the}} short program and third in the free skate, and {{finished}} third overall. Lysacek was also named to the team for the 2008 World Championships. A week before the event, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to an injury sustained while attempting a triple axel; the blade broke off of his boot and he injured {{the left side of his}} <b>body,</b> <b>from</b> his forearm to his shoulder, and required a cast. Lysacek toured over the summer of 2008 with the Stars on Ice tour.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the <b>body</b> <b>from</b> head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E

5|$|In frogs the {{pelvic girdle}} is robust and the hind legs are much longer and {{stronger}} than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their <b>body</b> <b>from</b> side to side.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either.

The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body.
