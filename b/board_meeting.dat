40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the determinants of the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> as an index for board activity including their monitoring role. Design/Methodology/Approach The research sample is composed of 120 UK firms based on their market capitalization for the period from 2003 to 2008. The study applies multinomial logistic modelling and conditional logistic modelling to investigate the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> Findings The study finds that board size and structure are positively related to the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> In addition, a negative impact of audit committee diligence on the frequency <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> is reported. The study finds no evidence that the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> are reduced when there is a CEO duality. Finally, the results show that firm size, leverage, free cash flows, and Tobin's Q have an impact on the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> Practical Implications This study shows the factors that affect the board effectiveness in the UK, namely that <b>board</b> <b>meetings,</b> <b>board</b> composition, and board size, are key indicators for good internal governance practices and, in turn, enhance board monitoring activities. Originality/Value The research offers the first major study to examine the determinants of the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> in UK non-financial firms. The paucity of the UK literature regarding board effectiveness in the UK reinforces the empirical importance of the results for researchers, managers, and UK policy makers...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the determinants of}} <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> as an index for board activity including the monitoring role of the boards. The research sample is composed of 120 UK firms based on their market capitalization for the period from 2003 to 2008. We apply Multinomial logistic modelling and conditional logistic modelling to investigate the frequency of <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> The results provide evidence {{for the importance of}} internal corporate governance monitoring systems on <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> We find that board size and structure are positively related to <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> This means that internal governance monitoring mechanisms are seen as complements to each other. In addition, we detect a negative impact of audit committee diligence on <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> This {{can be explained by the}} delegation of the authority between the boards and the audit committees. Moreover, the study reports no evidence that the <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> are reduced when there is a CEO duality. Finally, the results show that firm size, leverage, free cash flows, and Tobin’s Q have an impact on <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> This research offers the first major study to examine the determinants of <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> using UK non-financial firms. The paucity of the UK literature, regarding the board effectiveness in UK reinforces the empirical importance of the results for researchers, managers, and UK policy makers...|$|R
5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the ACLU {{filed an}} amicus brief in Citizens United v. FEC, {{arguing that the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 {{violated}} the First Amendment {{right to free speech}} by curtailing political speech. This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.|$|E

5|$|Smallpeice {{and seven}} {{of his fellow}} {{directors}} felt {{there was no other}} course of action left open to them but to ask Rowland to relinquish all executive appointments with Lonrho, but to allow him to remain on the board as a non-executive director. Rowland refused and the eight directors prepared to pass a motion at the first full <b>board</b> <b>meeting,</b> set for 18 April 1973, forcing Rowland to relinquish all of his executive appointments. Rowland, aware of the possibility, had obtained an interlocutory injunction from the High Court of Justice preventing the board from voting on his removal.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} company against a takeover, commissioning a report from McKinsey & Company on the future outlook of the company.

5|$|Following {{his term}} as commissioner, Chandler {{returned}} to Kentucky {{and won a}} second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing {{the integration of the}} state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Briskin was {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} related to the control of MGM. As part of a battle between Joseph R.

However, the special <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court, and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned. The conflict continued on throughout the year, until MGM held a stockholders' meeting in October. During the meeting, the shareholders agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors. Tomlinson's group was clearly routed, gaining only a single seat of the ten; that single seat was Briskin.|$|E

In October 1965, he {{was appointed}} chairman of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), with a $125,000 salary. To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies of Congress and the President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks. He retired as chairman due to ill health in 1970, although he remained a director.|$|E
5|$|Several local {{businesses}} considered contributing {{money to the}} mountain's purchase. Such funding would be considered surplus, {{and would not be}} subject to referendum. Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June1 town <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> that the cost of parking would increase if the property was purchased by a third party. One board member estimated that without paying rent, the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years. Ulster County Area Transit expressed a desire to route its buses through the property, creating a connection to the Mohonk Preserve. A nonprofit organization, the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association, was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain, the parking lot, and Willow Kiln Park.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{initially}} held {{discussions in}} 1965 with {{the newly formed}} Overseas Containers group, which {{was focused on the}} UK to Australia and Far East routes, about Cunard's Port Line subsidiary and Ronald Vestey's Blue Star Line joining British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P and the Ocean Steamship Company in the joint venture. Their approaches were rebuffed, and it was quickly decided that Cunard and Blue Star Line should try to form a rival group, which would be called Associated Container Transportation. The venture was formed in late 1965 and early 1966, with the first <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> taking place on 12 January 1966. Cunard's Port Line and Vestey's Blue Star Line were joined by Ben Line, Ellerman Lines and Harrison Line in the venture. Alexander Hull from Ellerman Lines was the inaugural chairman, but following his death in April 1967, Smallpeice took over as chairman of Associated Container Transportation.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E
5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive <b>Board</b> <b>meeting</b> in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hospital}} {{was founded in}} the town by Bishop Fray Pedro de Silva in 1485. Those affected by the plague epidemic were treated here in 1506. During the 16th century the city experienced a cultural renaissance thanks to personalities such as the painter Luis de Morales, the composer Juan Vázquez, the humanist Rodrigo Dosma, the poet Joaquin Romero de Cepeda, the playwright Diego Sánchez de Badajoz, the Dominican mystic Fray Luis de Granada and architect Gaspar Méndez. In 1524, a <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> between representatives of Spain and Portugal {{took place in the}} Old Town Hall in the city to clarify the status of their territorial arrangements, attended by Hernando Colón, Juan Vespucio, Sebastián Caboto, Juan Sebastián Elcano, Diego Ribeiro and Esteban Gómez. With reason to assert their rights to the Portuguese Crown, Philip II of Spain briefly moved his court to Badajoz in August 1580. Queen Anne of Austria died in the city two months later, and on 5 December 1580, Philip moved out of the city. From 1580 until 1640, {{as a result of the}} absence of war, the city flourished once again. According to the historian Vicente Navarro del Castillo, some 428 residents of Badajoz contributed to the Spanish conquest of the Americas, including Pedro de Alvarado, Luis de Moscoso, Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas (father of Inca Garcilaso) and Hernán Sánchez de Badajoz. In 1640 the city was attacked during the Portuguese Restoration War.|$|E
