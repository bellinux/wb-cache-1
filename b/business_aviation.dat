5|$|The {{sector was}} {{estimated}} to employ nearly 12,000 people and directly contribute £1.4billion to the UK economy in 2005, making it roughly sevenpercent {{of the size of}} the CAT industry. Nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by <b>business</b> <b>aviation.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Business</b> <b>aviation</b> {{has shown}} strong growth, {{although}} {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and <b>business</b> <b>aviation,</b> are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

The purpose for this multiunit case study was to explore what strategies small <b>aviation</b> <b>businesses</b> leaders used to reduce or control operating expenses for profitability. The sample comprised 3 small <b>aviation</b> <b>businesses</b> located in Middle Tennessee. The conceptual framework for this study built upon systems theory and sustainability theory. The data were collected through semistructured interviews and company documents. Member checking was completed to strengthen creditability and trustworthiness. Based on the methodological triangulation of the data sources collected, 5 emergent themes were identified after completing the 5 stages of data analysis: buying or purchasing power, being customer focused, having the right employees, having the right equipment, and leadership. When small <b>aviation</b> <b>business</b> owners incorporate these themes into their business model, they may increase the prosperity of their companies, the employees, their families, the surrounding communities, and the local economy. The findings from the study may contribute to social change by providing insights and strategies for small <b>aviation</b> <b>business</b> leaders in reducing operating costs for profitability. The data from this study may contribute to the prosperity of the small <b>aviation</b> <b>business</b> leaders, their employees, their families, the surrounding community, the local airport, and the local economy.
