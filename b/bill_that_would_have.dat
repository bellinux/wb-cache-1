5|$|Marostica, an avid motorcyclist, {{was among}} the {{prominent}} opponents of a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> required minors to wear motorcycle helmets while riding, even wearing his own motorcycle helmet to a committee hearing at which the bill was debated.|$|E
5|$|Stanley's {{administration}} {{was affected by}} the United States' entry into World War I. The legislature established and funded a state Council of Defense, but Stanley vetoed a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> banned the teaching of German in public schools.|$|E
5|$|During Washington's administration, the President {{was given}} broad powers for {{removing}} {{officials in the}} executive branch. Congress passed a bill sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mandated senatorial consent {{for the removal of}} Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E
50|$|Between 2003 and 2006 Lord Joffe made four {{attempts}} to introduce <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> legalized assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia - all were rejected by Parliament.|$|R
50|$|Walker had {{a strong}} pro-life record in the state assembly. With the {{exception}} of some bills while Walker was running for Milwaukee County Executive, Walker either sponsored or cosponsored all but three <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> restricted abortions.|$|R
50|$|He {{served as}} {{governor}} of Utah from 1909 to 1917. He was a Republican. Spry was a strong opponent of Prohibition, and vetoed two <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> implemented this. From 1921 to 1929 Spry served as commissioner of Public Lands.|$|R
5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since {{it was the first}} victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{provided}} {{funds to}} protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site {{to protect it from}} the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{allowed the}} {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; {{despite the fact that}} the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
50|$|For the 2000-2001 school year, Jones did {{not have}} a high school {{yearbook}} or senior photographs since the school administration had not been paying the <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed those functions to occur. For the 2001-2002 school year, only Vanguard program students would appear in the school yearbook.|$|R
50|$|Doggett {{voted against}} the Federal Marriage Amendment in the 109th Congress. He voted against HR 4380 and HR 2587, <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> banned {{adoption}} by same-sex couples. In 1996, Doggett voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), but became a cosponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal DOMA, in 2011.|$|R
25|$|During {{his time}} in the Oregon Senate, Joseph {{introduced}} numerous <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> promoted the development of hydroelectric power under public ownership. At the time, the state was home to less than 1% of the U.S. population, but was understood to possess 10 to 12% of the nation's potential hydroelectric capacity. Joseph's bills, however, were not taken seriously in the Senate.|$|R
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
5|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation <b>Bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> brought {{the vote to}} a million women, {{so long as they}} owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of his term, Crittenden was {{concerned}} with quelling the violence in Kansas Territory. An opponent of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, Crittenden also opposed repealing the Missouri Compromise unless the North agreed to substitute popular sovereignty for the exclusion of slavery north of the 36°30' line. In early 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the Kansas Territory to ensure that fair elections were held there, but the proposal was blocked by the Pierce administration. He did not agree with all of the act proposed by Robert Toombs to allow for a constitutional convention in Kansas Territory, but he supported it as a step to bring peace there. He regarded the ratifications of both the Topeka Constitution and the Lecompton Constitution as invalid, and made one of the most highly regarded speeches of his career in opposition to the latter. His substitute <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another ratification vote was supported by Republicans, but it was ultimately defeated. So great was Crittenden's influence after his actions on the Kansas question that Abraham Lincoln felt that Crittenden's endorsement of Stephen Douglas cost Lincoln the Illinois senatorial election in 1858.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, J Street lobbied the U.S. Senate {{against a}} group of <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> penalized the Palestinian National Authority if it used its {{recently}} elevated status of [...] "observer" [...] at the United Nations to bring international charges against Israel. J Street supporters made 1000 telephone calls and sent 15,000 e-mail messages against the bills, which failed to pass.|$|R
50|$|From 1887, various {{attempts}} were made to pass bills enabling female suffrage, the first of which was authored by Julius Vogel, the 8th Premier of New Zealand. Each bill came close to passing. Several electoral <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given adult women the right to vote were passed in the House of Representatives but defeated in the upper Legislative Council.|$|R

5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, {{failed to make the}} statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

50|$|In 1874, with Manitoba's {{finances}} in peril, {{the provincial}} government appealed to Ottawa for assistance. Ottawa agreed to provide aid, but demanded that the Legislative Council be eliminated in order to cut expenses. When the council twice rejected <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in its demise, Morris intervened by offering recalcitrant councillors lucrative government positions elsewhere. Due to Morris' mediation, Manitoba's Legislative Council became the first provincial upper house to be abolished in 1876.|$|R
25|$|In December 2015, Goldsmith {{voted in}} support of the government's plans to expand the aerial bombing of Islamic State targets. He also {{endorsed}} a government <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> restricted trade union's abilities to strike.|$|E

25|$|Following Senator Ted Cruz's 21-hour speech {{opposing}} the Affordable Care Act in 2013, Sessions joined Cruz and 17 other Senators in a failed vote against cloture on a comprehensive government funding <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> continued funding healthcare reform.|$|E
50|$|During the {{following}} offseason, Shelton {{was the subject}} of various trade rumors. He was linked to the Chicago Bears, and to a trade with the Buffalo <b>Bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sent running back Travis Henry to Arizona. The Cardinals drafted Virginia offensive guard Elton Brown in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft which further cemented the end of Shelton's tenure with the team. He was finally released on May 18, 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Nine US states, {{including}} the southwestern border states of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona, have banned horse-tripping as a sport, although horses {{may still be}} roped and taken to the ground when required for veterinary care, identification and branding; or essentially, reasons other than entertainment. [...] In 2011, the state legislatures of Oregon and Nevada considered but did not pass <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> stopped horse tripping, [...] and, in Colorado, a bill intended to ban both horse-tripping and steer-tailing also failed.|$|R
50|$|Cuomo was {{notable for}} his liberal {{political}} views, particularly his steadfast {{opposition to the}} death penalty, an opinion that was unpopular in New York during the high-crime era of the 1980s and early 1990s. While governor, he vetoed several <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> re-established capital punishment in New York State. The death penalty was reinstated by Governor Pataki the year after he defeated Cuomo in the 1994 election, although it was never put into effect and the statute was declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in 2004.|$|R
25|$|In May 2015, a House {{committee}} {{rejected a}} <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> protected people who exercise {{their religious beliefs}} on same-sex marriage.
