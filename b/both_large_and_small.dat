Conversely, a single deep nuclear cell receives input from approximately 860 Purkinje cells (again in cats).|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|While early incense seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, {{to allow for the}} changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E

50|$|The {{extraction}} of groundwater in <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> amounts lowers the areas water table, <b>and</b> in too <b>large</b> of quantities can even collapse {{parts of the}} aquifer and permanently damage the quantity of water the aquifer can store.|$|R
50|$|From {{this point}} on, Dinkys were usually made in 1:42 scale, though unlike Spot-On {{they were not}} {{consistent}} and continued to make <b>both</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> models {{to fit in with}} different market niches. Spot-On's doll house furniture line was made at 1:16 scale.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage {{was caused by the}} initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E

25|$|In Italy towers {{are almost}} always free {{standing}} and the position is often dictated by the landform of the site, rather than aesthetics. This {{is the case in}} nearly all Italian churches <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small,</b> except in Sicily where a number of churches were founded by the Norman rulers and are more French in appearance.|$|E
50|$|Often, bronze {{versions}} of the medals are struck for sale by the U.S. Mint, and may be available in <b>both</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> sizes. In at least one case, the John Wayne medal, private dealers bought large numbers of the bronze version. They were then gold plated and resold {{to the public for}} a significant profit.|$|R

25|$|The {{violent crime}} rate In Lake Charles {{is one of}} the highest in the nation, across {{communities}} of all sizes (<b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small).</b> Violent offenses tracked included rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, including assault with a deadly weapon. The overall crime rate in Lake Charles is 67% higher than the national average.|$|E
25|$|Romanesque churches {{generally}} {{have a single}} portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for {{the facade of the}} building. Some churches such as Saint-Étienne, Caen, (11th century) and Pisa Cathedral (late 12th century) had three western portals, in the manner of Early Christian basilicas. Many churches, <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small,</b> had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Peña Nieto {{announced}} {{an end to}} Pemex's monopoly, inviting in <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> private companies to {{the oil and gas}} industry. He said that in early 2015, more than 100 blocks would be auctioned for development. The government believes that changing technology will allow additional drilling in mature fields, such as those near Tampico, as well as larger fields likely offshore. This decision has received international coverage.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{differences}} are {{between the groups}} found north or south of the Amazon basin. The 'northern' variants all look {{very much like the}} holotype and are distinguished primarily by shell, head, and limb coloration. The variants south of the Amazon are generally <b>both</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> than the holotype, have a very different plastral pattern, and have an enlarged scale or 'spur' {{on the inside of the}} fore limb elbow.|$|R
25|$|The {{association}} {{has more than}} 100 members, including small labels typically run by one to five people, medium size organisations and very large companies with international affiliates. ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small.</b> As of October 2010, the directors were Denis Handlin (chair, CEO of Sony Music), George Ash (Universal Music), Mark Poston (EMI), Sebastian Chase (MGM Distribution), David Vodica (Rubber Records/Music) and Tony Harlow (WAR).|$|E
25|$|Within {{the next}} several decades, factories, <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small,</b> would dot the area landscape. What had mainly been an {{agricultural}} and ranching area would get replaced {{with a variety of}} manufacturing industries. Moreland operated from 1917 to 1937. Aerospace supplier Menasco Manufacturing Company would later purchase the property. Menasco's Burbank landing gear factory closed in 1994 due to slow commercial and military orders, affecting 310 people. Within months of Moreland's arrival, Community Manufacturing Company, a $3 million tractor company, arrived in Burbank.|$|E
25|$|It was {{introduced}} to British gardens in 1736. In the UK, it is encountered frequently in gardens <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small,</b> {{as well as some}} parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed as a hedge, but is considered inferior for this usage compared to Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there. In Germany, it is the most frequently seen hemlock in cultivation, and is also used in forestry.|$|E
50|$|Provisions of the Law on Courts {{which came}} into force on January 1, 2013 define the new court {{structure}} and their hierarchy in Kosovo. The new structure not only changes the old court organization, {{but it also}} establishes new courts which are now located in <b>both,</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> municipalities. The aim of this structure is to bring more efficiency courts, and bring judges and court-houses more closer {{to the citizens of}} Kosovo.|$|R
50|$|A crucially {{important}} {{property of}} the real numbers {{is that it is}} an Archimedean field, meaning it has the Archimedean property that for any real number, there is an integer larger than it in absolute value. An equivalent statement is that for any real number, there are integers <b>both</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller.</b> Such real closed fields that are not Archimedean, are non-Archimedean ordered fields. For example, any field of hyperreal numbers is real closed and non-Archimedean.|$|R

25|$|The {{structure}} was immediately dismantled {{to make way}} for something larger. Construction on the Basilica began in 1921 after Father Baker unveiled plans at a parish council meeting to build a shrine in homage to the Blessed Mother. Because of Baker's influence in the community and well-known charitable reputation across the nation, he was able to get sufficient financial support to begin construction quickly. Baker solicited support for his project, and thousands from across the nation contributed funding <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small,</b> mostly through a direct-mail fundraising club. Designed by Emile Ulrich, the basilica was constructed at a cost of $3.2 million, but the project was completed without the parish incurring any debt.|$|E
25|$|As smaller {{pulmonary}} emboli tend {{to lodge}} in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation {{they are more}} likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and fainting, but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> PEs. Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and BNP levels.|$|E
25|$|Through 1901, Pușcariu's {{writings}} regularly {{appeared in}} Gazeta de Transilvania. He also made important contributions to Luceafărul, headed by Octavian Codru Tăslăuanu (whom he had befriended as a schoolmate in Brașov), while it appeared both in Budapest and, after 1906, in Sibiu. In 1902, {{he was elected}} a corresponding member of ASTRA's literary section. During {{the remainder of his}} life, he undertook activities related to the society, although at varying paces: active that decade in its philological efforts, he found himself largely overtaken by other activities in the 1910s, only to organize a series of conferences starting in the mid-1920s in Transylvania's towns, <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small.</b> These continued through 1939, and while his work again took him away from ASTRA in the 1940s, it was to its Brașov chapter's president that he sent the manuscript of his history of the city in 1947.|$|E

50|$|Since it uses <b>both</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>smaller</b> mipmaps, trilinear {{filtering}} {{cannot be used}} in places where the pixel is smaller than a texel on the original texture, because mipmaps larger than the original texture are not defined. Fortunately bilinear filtering still works, {{and can be used}} in these situations without worrying too much about abruptness because bilinear and {{trilinear filtering}} provide the same result when the pixel size is exactly the same as the size of a texel on the appropriate mipmap.|$|R
