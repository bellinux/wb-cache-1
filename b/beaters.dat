5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden <b>beaters.</b> When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the <b>beaters,</b> juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E
5|$|Technically, kulintang is the Maguindanao, Ternate and Timor {{term for}} the idiophone of metal gong kettles which are laid {{horizontally}} upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden <b>beaters.</b> Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the kulintang is also called kolintang by the Maranao and those in Sulawesi, kulintangan, gulintangan by those in Sabah and the Sulu Archipelago and totobuang by those in central Maluku.|$|E
25|$|The bludger is a slightly-deflated dodgeball {{that can}} only be {{manipulated}} by <b>beaters.</b> At any given time there are four <b>beaters</b> in play, but only three bludgers. The bludgers are used to hit any other player on the field. Upon being hit by a bludger previously in the possession of an opposing beater, the player suffers the knockout effect. This means they must dismount their broom, drop any ball that they may have been carrying, and touch their team's hoops before resuming play. It's worth noting that there is no friendly fire, meaning that bludgers thrown by <b>beaters</b> cannot affect any of their teammates.|$|E

50|$|A Hollander <b>beater</b> design {{consists}} of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a <b>beater</b> wheel at a single point along the raceway. The <b>beater</b> wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate, similar {{to the construction of}} a water wheel or timing pulley. Under power, the blades rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry. The <b>beater</b> wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers when passing through the <b>beater.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{egg beater}} is a hand-cranked mixing device for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It {{typically}} {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a piston, which drives one or two <b>beaters.</b> The <b>beaters</b> are immersed in the food to be mixed. In 1856, American tinner Ralph Collier of Baltimore, Maryland, invented and patented the first rotary egg beater with rotating parts. Collier was issued U.S. patent #16,267 on December 23, 1856.|$|E

25|$|Scutching {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or <b>beaters.</b> The <b>beaters,</b> which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the paper's {{manufacture}} in the pre-Hispanic period. Stone <b>beaters</b> dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to macerate the fibers. These <b>beaters</b> are still used by Otomi artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers and pounded into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{standard}} <b>beaters</b> mentioned above, implements used to strike the drum may include keyboard percussion mallets, timpani mallets, and drumsticks. The hand or fingers {{can also be used}} (it. con la mano). The playing techniques possible include rolls, repetitions and unison strokes. Bass drums can sometimes be used for sound effects. e.g. thunder, or an earthquake.|$|E
50|$|Gongs and tam-tams {{are easily}} {{confused}} with one another. A gong, generally, {{is a large}} hung cymbal with a nipple. As such, they're usually known as nipple gongs. This nipple is a small dome in {{the centre of the}} cymbal that produces a single note when struck with a soft <b>beater.</b> Conversely, a tam-tam has no nipple, and so has a flat central area. When this cymbal is struck with a <b>beater</b> (most usually a soft <b>beater),</b> it produces a myriad of sounds with no single overruling note.|$|R
50|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a <b>beater</b> or mallet forward into the drumhead. The <b>beater</b> head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and <b>beater</b> system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.A double bass drum pedal operates much the same way only with a second footplate controlling a second <b>beater</b> on the same drum. Most commonly this is attached by a shaft to a remote <b>beater</b> mechanism alongside the primary pedal mechanism. One notable exception to this pattern is the symmetrical Sleishman twin bass drum pedal.|$|R

25|$|Play runs rapidly, {{with quick}} change-of-hands of the quaffle, because every goal (each being worth 10 points) scored against a team gives that team the ball. Once a point is scored, the quaffle {{must be given}} to the other team's keeper, and almost {{immediately}} returns to the offensive with the chasers returning to their keeper zone or proper side of the pitch; <b>beaters</b> are not bound to return to their side of the pitch nor exit the opposing team's keeper zone at any point. Games can last any length of time longer than 18 minutes, depending on the skill and endurance of the seekers and snitch.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{describe}} the strategic actions taken by members of Tom-tom <b>beater</b> caste communities so as to escape from identity-based marginalization and to illustrate consequential barriers for them to successfully perform their strategic actions. This descriptive study is based on qualitative and ethnographical research methods. The study is confined to the selected Tom-tom <b>beater</b> caste communities of Batticaloa district. The study found that demarcated territory and traditional occupation are major factors that make members of Tom-tom <b>beater</b> caste communities more susceptible to subtle forms of marginalization. They pursue two strategies to escape from marginalization on territorial base. Firstly, they try to migrate from their territory and to settle down in places situated very far from their native niches. Secondly, they attempt to get their marital partners from higher caste groups living in remote places by concealing their caste identity. Educated youths have affianced in a radical strategy to annihilate their caste obligation and to prevent their caste men to serve high castes on traditional caste service basis. The study also found barriers for these strategic actions of members of Tom-tom <b>beater</b> caste and evaluates the strategic actions {{from the perspectives of}} Tom-tom <b>beater</b> caste members and other high caste members. And it recommends ways to support these strategies of Tom-tom <b>beater</b> caste to promote their social security...|$|R

25|$|To score points, chasers or keepers {{must get}} the quaffle, a {{slightly}} deflated volleyball, {{into one of}} three of the opposing hoops which scores the team 10 points. To impede the quaffle from advancing down the pitch, chasers and keepers are able to tackle opposing chasers and keepers {{at the same time as}} <b>beaters</b> using their bludgers—dodgeballs—to take out opposing players. Once a player is hit by an opposing bludger, that player must dismount their broom, drop any ball being held, and return to and touch their hoops before being allowed back into play.
