In January 1943, however, Rear Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarines, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was killed in a plane crash. Christie hoped to get the position but the job went to Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, and the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel</b> selected Christie to take over Lockwood's old command. Christie lobbied Vice Admiral Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane. Carpender refused, and Christie went on to Fremantle. Nevertheless, Christie continued to try for some time to take the Brisbane force under his control.|$|E

Robinson delivered naval hardware and supplies to Horne, who combined Robinson's materiel with the manpower trained by the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel</b> and passed the battle-ready products to King, who deployed them. Robinson and his Army counterpart, Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, reported directly to the chairman of the War Production Board, Donald M.

500|$|In {{establishing}} {{the office of}} the director, the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel</b> did not define the responsibilities of the office, nor establish clear lines of authority. [...] "...Lieutenant Commander McAfee was simply told that she was to [...] "run" [...] the women's reserve and she was to go directly to the Chief of Naval Personnel for answers to her questions. Unfortunately, the decision was not made known to the operating divisions of the bureau." ...|$|E
500|$|August and September 1942 saw 108 {{more women}} {{commissioned}} as {{officers in the}} Women's Reserve; selected because of their educational and business backgrounds. They were drawn to the program by the good standing of McAfee and the Advisory Council. Four of these women would later become {{the directors of the}} WAVES and another the director of the SPARS (U.S. Coast Guard Women's Reserve). The new officers began their work routine with no grasp of Navy traditions, or training in the operating methods in use, resulting in some difficult times. However, on 16 September 1942 the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel</b> issued a memorandum for the organization of the Women's Reserve. It said the director would administer the program, set policies, and coordinate work within the bureau's operating divisions. [...] Soon, McAfee was able to bring together a capable staff, building a sound internal organization.|$|E
500|$|Although a small {{contingent}} of WAVES was retained {{to help with}} the Navy's over-all demobilization plan, many of these women had volunteered to remain on active duty. At that point, Vice Admiral Louis Denfeld, chief of the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel,</b> announced, [...] "Our plan is to keep a WAVE component in the Naval Reserve. Further, if Congress approves, we will seek to retain on active duty reasonable number of WAVES who wish to do so and who may be needed in certain specialties..." [...] On 30 July 1948, the Women's Armed Services Integration Act (Public Law 625) was signed into law, allowing women to serve in the regular Navy. The wartime assumptions that prohibited women from duty in any unit designated as having a combat mission carried over with the 1948 Act, which effectively incorporated women into service organizations; legally keeping them from being integrated {{into the heart of the}} military and naval professions for more than a quarter of a century. Even though the WAVES no longer existed, the obsolete acronym continued in popular and official usage until the 1970s." ...|$|E

500|$|Then on 2 January 1942, the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel,</b> in an about face, {{recommended}} to the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, that Congress {{be asked to}} authorize a women's organization. The following month, Knox recommended a women's branch {{as part of the}} Naval Reserve. [...] The director of the Bureau of the Budget said no, but would agree to the Navy adapting legislation similar to the WAAC – where women were with, but not in the Navy. [...] This was unacceptable to Knox and the standoff began. Still, the Bureau of Aeronautics continued to believe there was a place for women in the Navy, and appealed to an influential friend of naval aviation, Margaret Chung. [...] In Crossed Currents, the authors describe Chung and her involvement. [...] "...Dr. Margaret Chung of San Francisco, a physician and surgeon, had a long time interest in aviation, particularly naval aviation... She had many naval aviation friends who referred to themselves as [...] "sons of Mom Chung." [...] Having learned of the stalemate, she asked Representative Melvin Maas of Minnesota, who had served in the aviation branch of the U.S. Marine Corps in World War I, and was one of her [...] "sons", to introduce legislation independently of the Navy.

2500|$|While {{chief of}} the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel,</b> Holloway {{summarized}} his philosophy {{to a group of}} young naval officers: [...] "You men probably do not think of it in this way, but I do. To be commissioned in the Navy, you had to be appointed by the President with the approval of Congress. This is the procedure and requirement for the seating of a Supreme Court judge or an ambassador. This is why a naval officer must have his chin out at all times." [...] Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a lieutenant commander in BuPers from 1953–1955, remembered Holloway as [...] "the superior who most impressed me when I was a young officer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the inter-war {{years there}} was much debate over how the French high command should be organised, {{including}} the role and location of GQG. [...] In the years following the deactivation of the First World War's GQG it was planned that any new GQG would have control of only [...] the metropolitan theatre of operations. [...] The structure was to consist of a commander-in-chief, a major-général and three aide-majors. [...] There were to be four bureaus with different areas of responsibility, much like the GQG of the First World War. [...] The First Bureau dealt with organisation, the Second Bureau with information, the Third Bureau with military operations and the Fourth Bureau with logistics. [...] There would also have been a <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel,</b> a Courier Section, a group of Inspector-Generals and a group composed of units and services particular to GQG. [...] A reorganisation proposal was submitted to Marshal Philippe Pétain (Vice-Chairman of the CSG) in 1928, which sought to reduce the sluggishness and inefficiency within the unit. [...] In 1933 another proposed amendment sought to clarify the commander-in-chiefs powers. [...] It was proposed that {{he would continue to}} have authority over just the metropolitan theatre but would act as an advisor to all other theatres and as a coordinator with any allied forces. [...] However no reforms were implemented.|$|E
