5|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con, it was {{announced}} that a reunion between Zuko and his mother, Ursa, had been arranged and made into a storyboard. However, it was dropped just before the finale was finished, as requested by show co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, who felt that it resolved Ursa's disappearance in an unsatisfactory way and that wasn't the way the story should <b>be</b> <b>told.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, {{the studio}} {{announced}} a new film in development titled Rose Red, a live-action spin-off film which will <b>be</b> <b>told</b> {{from the perspective of}} Snow White's sister, Red Rose. In late October that year, a live-action feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was announced, with Erin Cressida Wilson in negotiations to write the script and Pasek and Paul writing new songs for the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} avoid {{introducing}} the conviction {{for the murder of}} Anthony Smith worked against Silcott too. It meant that the jury could not <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that he had signed on for his bail at Tottenham police station at around 7 pm on the evening of Blakelock's death. This was when witnesses had placed Silcott at a Broadwater Youth Association meeting, making inflammatory speeches against the police.|$|E

5|$|They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being {{consistently}} {{smaller than}} males. The size difference {{between males and}} females is proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> from tracks.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} <b>be</b> <b>told</b> to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{pre-production}} {{on the third}} series began, Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single-handedly and believed all the stories that could <b>be</b> <b>told</b> had been told. ITV were keen {{to increase the number}} of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to add two more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived.|$|E
50|$|While {{this theory}} is {{considered}} exceedingly unlikely by some, {{it is not}} so considered by Janina Fialkowska, the pianist who premiered Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 3 in 1990. She says she <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by Roch Serra (who <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by the Liszt scholar Professor Milstein, who <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by Vera Timanova, who <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by Sophie Menter herself), that Liszt was indeed the composer of the piece, but he did not want Tchaikovsky to be aware of this.|$|R

5|$|Following {{his service}} in the Mexican–American War, Washington joined the Charles Town Mining Company and {{traveled}} to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush with his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington; however, there are no existing records of Washington finding gold during his pursuit. While in California, Washington authored the novel, A Tale to <b>be</b> <b>Told</b> Some Fifty Years Hence, {{which was published in}} 1853.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot <b>be</b> <b>told</b> from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{when the story}} first emerged, but similar stories, {{possibly}} inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist at the nearby locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, Sir Guy the Seeker, popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822. The tale continues to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> {{as part of the}} local oral tradition.|$|E

5|$|Lana Crawford is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Bridget Neval. The actress's casting {{was announced in}} June 2004, and she stated that she was excited {{to take on the}} role of Lana, a schoolgirl and the serial's first lesbian character. Neval explained that Lana's sexuality did not bother her, but she hoped her story would not <b>be</b> <b>told</b> in a sensationalist or distasteful way. Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer finally {{agrees to}} give up the inhalers, but only to Kate. He again says he will hand over the {{medication}} if she kisses him, which she reluctantly does, only to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> by him that he does not have the medication after all. Kate elbows Sawyer, and an enraged Sayid attacks him, stabbing him in the arm and hitting an artery. Jack arrives to stop the bleeding and save Sawyer's life.|$|E
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to be a third-person shooter so that players can see the three characters change and evolve as it progresses, and that the perspective differentiates the game from others shooters in the market. The game was meant to feature narrative gameplay, in which the game was to be played without any cutscenes so that the entire story would <b>be</b> <b>told</b> through gameplay sequences only. However, the idea was downplayed as the development team realized that having cutscenes helps players to be more emotionally connected and allowed the team to create dramatic scripted sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back {{together}} again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> where the first body part can be found. Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen. The location of the refrigerator is randomized {{at the beginning of each}} new game.|$|E

In partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, students are documenting stages of transition along University Avenue through the stories of elders, business owners, and residents affected by the METRO Green Line light-rail transit project.

5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on the practice field lights, only to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
