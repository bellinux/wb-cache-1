5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> birds, such {{as little}} penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well. In the Bismarck Archipelago {{it has been}} {{reported}} feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus. It is a skilled hunter, and will attack prey up {{to the size of a}} swan. They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E
25|$|Regression is also similar, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> {{into account}} that the data is imprecise. Given some points, and a {{measurement}} {{of the value of}} some function at these points (with an error), we want to determine the unknown function. The least squares-method is one popular way to achieve this.|$|E

25|$|For {{a market}} to be competitive, {{there must be}} more than a single buyer or seller. It has been {{suggested}} that two people may trade, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> at least three persons to have a market, so that there is competition in at least one of its two sides.|$|E
25|$|For {{reactions}} involving oxygen, {{the gain}} of oxygen implies the oxidation {{of the atom}} or molecule to which the oxygen is added (and the oxygen is reduced). In organic compounds, such as butane or ethanol, the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost (and the hydrogen is reduced). This follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with non-metals <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the electron along when it is lost. Conversely, loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction.|$|E
25|$|It takes {{around five}} days of total {{abstinence}} to unmask a food or chemical, {{during the first week}} on an elimination diet withdrawal symptoms can occur <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> at least two weeks to remove residual traces. If symptoms have not subsided after six weeks, food intolerance is unlikely to be involved and a normal diet should be restarted. Withdrawals are often associated with a lowering of the threshold for sensitivity which assists in challenge testing, but in this period individuals can be ultra-sensitive even to food smells so care must be taken to avoid all exposures.|$|E

25|$|The town's last {{remaining}} independent preparatory school, Sunnymede School, {{which was in}} Westcliffe Road, Birkdale closed in 2010 {{due to a lack}} of pupils. In the past the town had more independent schools which included Tower Dene, which was situated on Cambridge Road. This school closed in 2002 due to a similar fate. One of the Victorian houses that housed the school has since been turned into apartments, the other is now a nursery. Kingswood College (originally St Wyburn's) is now housed outside Southport at Scarisbrick Hall, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> many pupils from the town. Brighthelmston School (girls) and University School (boys) are long closed.|$|E

After reclaiming it, the Masters store the relic in their Sanctum Sanctorum with others like it.

25|$|The {{number of}} loci in a {{vertebrate}} species {{has been estimated}} at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at {{most of them are}} very slight. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.|$|E

25|$|Vesicles in {{the nerve}} {{terminal}} are grouped into three pools: the readily releasable pool, the recycling pool, and the reserve pool. These pools are distinguished by their function and {{position in the}} nerve terminal. The readily releasable pool are docked to the cell membrane, making these {{the first group of}} vesicles to be released on stimulation. The readily releasable pool is small and is quickly exhausted. The recycling pool is proximate to the cell membrane, and tend to be cycled at moderate stimulation, so that the rate of vesicle release is the same as, or lower than, the rate of vesicle formation. This pool is larger than the readily releasable pool, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> longer to become mobilised. The reserve pool contains vesicles that are not released under normal conditions. This reserve pool can be quite large (~50%) in neurons grown on a glass substrate, but is very small or absent at mature synapses in intact brain tissue.|$|E

500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a sucker for a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today gave a {{negative}} review, {{stating that the}} film [...] "is trying for a new image. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> more than an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue." [...] Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously." [...] Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called the film [...] "a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message—family, family, family—is the processed cream filling." ...|$|E

500|$|Inglis {{writes that}} the message of [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] is [...] "in the title". The theme of waiting is also central to a track that Harrison wrote in 1967 while in the Beatles, [...] "Blue Jay Way", and a similar {{sentiment}} appears in his 1970–71 solo hit [...] "My Sweet Lord", through the line [...] "I {{really want to see}} you, Lord, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> so long". In the latter lyric, Harrison expresses his impatience to see and know God, and Harrison biographer Geoffrey Giuliano interprets [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] as a further reflection of the singer's spiritual concerns.|$|E
500|$|In the end, Wilder {{was happy}} with Monroe's performance, stating: [...] "Anyone can {{remember}} lines, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> a real artist {{to come on the}} set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did!" [...] Despite the difficulties of its production, Some Like It Hot became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety to call her [...] "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat". It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound.|$|E
500|$|Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, {{felt that}} the film was [...] "far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight".
