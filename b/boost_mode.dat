40|$|A {{bidirectional}} converter (BDC) {{is essential}} in applications where energy storage devices are involved. Such applications include transportation, battery less un-interruptible power system, flywheel energy storage systems, etc. Bidirectional power flow through buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation along with high power density and efficiency is important requirement of such systems. This paper presents a new BDC topology {{using a combination of}} fast turn-off SCR and insulated-gate bipolar transistor with a novel control logic implementation to achieve zero switching losses through zero voltage transition and zero current transition techniques. The proposed scheme ensures zero switching power loss (ZSPL) for both buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation of the BDC. The scheme is simple and achieves ZSPL during both turn-on and turn-off of the devices resulting in improved efficiency and reduced electromagnetic interference problems. The basic principle of operation, analysis, and design procedure are presented for both voltage buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation of the proposed BDC topology.
