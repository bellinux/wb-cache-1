40|$|A {{bidirectional}} converter (BDC) {{is essential}} in applications where energy storage devices are involved. Such applications include transportation, battery less un-interruptible power system, flywheel energy storage systems, etc. Bidirectional power flow through buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation along with high power density and efficiency is important requirement of such systems. This paper presents a new BDC topology {{using a combination of}} fast turn-off SCR and insulated-gate bipolar transistor with a novel control logic implementation to achieve zero switching losses through zero voltage transition and zero current transition techniques. The proposed scheme ensures zero switching power loss (ZSPL) for both buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation of the BDC. The scheme is simple and achieves ZSPL during both turn-on and turn-off of the devices resulting in improved efficiency and reduced electromagnetic interference problems. The basic principle of operation, analysis, and design procedure are presented for both voltage buck and <b>boost</b> <b>modes</b> of operation of the proposed BDC topology.

25|$|The CAB {{investigated}} the accident, {{and as the}} wreckage pieces were reassembled and scrutinized, {{it became apparent that}} a critical 5/16 inch AN-175-21 nickel steel bolt was missing in the elevator boost linkage mechanism. By carefully examining and analyzing the various scuff marks and grease patterns near the missing bolt, the CAB investigators concluded that the bolt had fallen out prior to the aircraft's disintegration and collision with the ground, and not {{as a result of the}} accident itself. Without the bolt in place, the elevator (when in <b>boost</b> <b>mode)</b> and hence the entire aircraft would become uncontrollable, leading the investigators to deduce that the bolt had fallen out, most likely by working itself loose, a short time prior to the beginning of the accident sequence.|$|E
