50|$|Porcupinefish are fish {{belonging}} to the family Diodontidae (order Tetraodontiformes), also commonly called blowfish and, sometimes, <b>balloonfish</b> and globefish. They are sometimes collectively called pufferfish, {{not to be confused}} with the morphologically similar and closely related Tetraodontidae, which are more commonly given this name.|$|E

50|$|The {{first big}} {{performing}} arts party celebrating the festival's return into the 2015 year was called The <b>Balloonfish</b> Bash. On November 8, 2014 fire performers Pyroklectic provided a 25-minute sneak {{preview of the}} show they planned to do at Tsunami on the Square 2015. Ballet Folklorico Sol de Mexico, a dance troupe composed of girls {{between the ages of}} 5 and 12, made their Tsunami debut that night. Other performers included jugglers Frankie Cardamone and Heather and Ivan Marriott, Jewel of the Desert Belly Dance, Zumba Fitness with Tiger and Albert Sarko and the Jazz Workshop Band.|$|E
50|$|The Tetraodontidae are {{a family}} of {{primarily}} marine and estuarine fish of the order Tetraodontiformes. The family includes many familiar species which are variously called pufferfish, puffers, <b>balloonfish,</b> blowfish, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, honey toads, sugar toads, and sea squab. They are morphologically similar to the closely related porcupinefish, which have large external spines (unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are only visible when the fish has puffed up). The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) using fluorescent detection following post-column alkaline degradation and a sample preparation procedure {{for the analysis}} were established to quantitatively detect tetrodotoxins (TTXs) in gastropods and puffer fishes. The analysis showed 91 % recovery of TTXs using the sample preparation {{described in this article}} and a wide (10 - 2000 ng) linear relationship between the tetrodotoxin amount and its fluorescent response. A good correlation between the results of mouse bioassay and HPLC was also obtained in this research. Each specimen of lined-moon shell, Natica linea-ta Roeding, collected from Tungkang from October 1994 to September 1995 was analyzed by HPLC to detect the presence and quantity of TTXs. Overall results showed that 45 % of the gastropods contained TTXs with an average content of 54. 5 µg in toxic specimens. The rate of toxic specimens in the ten samples collected monthly varied, but there were no sea-sonal trends. Random sampling of cultured tiger puffer, Takifugu rubripes rubripes Temminck & Schlegel, and field-collected <b>balloonfish,</b> Diodon holocanthus Linnaeus, trace amounts of TTXs were found only in ovaries of balloonfishes. Muscle tissues of balloon-fishes, and the livers, ovaries, and muscles of cultured tiger puffers showed no tetrodotoxin (< 0. 2 µg/g tissue) in this screening procedure.
