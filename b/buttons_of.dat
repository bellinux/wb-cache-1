5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the {{thatched}} barn now stands) contained a high status cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and copper alloy, and two gold cones that would have covered <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> an organic material. The burial-goods recovered {{are similar to those}} of the Wessex culture, the Wilsford and Dorset Ridgeway series in particular. An urn from one of the barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E

A separate gallery holds material and photographs from excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India inside the fort in 1995. The Indian National Army Memorial at Moirang, Manipur, commemorates the place where the flag of Azad Hind was raised by Col. Shaukat Hayat Malik.

25|$|Crafts form an {{important}} part of the state’s economy, providing all or part of many families’ income. The state government passed the Ley de Fomento a la Cultural in 1988 which works to protect crafts produced within the state. One type of handcraft produced in the state is metalworking with most precious and non-precious metals. The best known work produced in the state is made with silver, centered in the town of Taxco. Each year this town holds the annual National Silver Fair (Feria Nacional de la Plata). Gold is worked in locations such as Iguala, Ciudad Altamirano, Coyuca de Catalán, Arcelia and Ometepec. Steel machetes and other items are produced in Ayutla, Tixtla, Chilapa, Tecpan deGaleana and Ometepec. Gold leaf is done in Tlacotepec, Tlalchipa and Cuetzala del Progreso. Costume jewelry is made in Acatlán, and Chilapa, producing <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> various colors, pieces made of brass coated in nickel, glass and metal wire to produce items such as necklaces, bracelets, and more. Other jewelry is made by twisting and weaving fine strands of silver or gold wire. Silver is mostly done in Taxco, with gold pieces in Ciudad Altamirano.|$|E

500|$|The {{regulation}} infantry buttons for {{enlisted men}} described the button {{as to have}} a number on the front to reflect the unit designation; for example, {{a soldier in the}} 1st Confederate Infantry Regiment would have a [...] "1" [...] on the <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> his coat. These buttons are rare or non-existent. However, the officer's regulation button, consisting of the [...] "block I" [...] button, for Infantry, the A for Artillery, etc.; was very common amongst soldiers, and replaced the efforts to produce the different, numbered buttons for each regiment in service.|$|E
500|$|The Naga 2014 was {{released}} in July 2013 and featured [...] "more pronounced, redesigned individual buttons, allowing for easier recognition and more precise button presses." [...] It had a total of nineteen programmable buttons, twelve of which are side-on.

The only other iteration which has a maximum sensitivity of 8,200 DPI is the Naga Epic Chroma, released in November 2014. The Naga Epic Chroma is wireless and also featured nineteen programmable <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> which twelve are on the side.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{returned}} to Gatchina {{and was not}} permitted {{to return to his}} unit or to travel beyond the Petrograd area. On 5 April 1917, he was discharged from military service. By July, Prince Lvov had resigned as Prime Minister to be replaced by Alexander Kerensky, who ordered ex-Emperor Nicholas removed from Petrograd to Tobolsk in the Urals because it was [...] "some remote place, some quiet corner, where they would attract less attention". On the eve of Nicholas's departure, Kerensky gave permission for Michael to visit him. Kerensky remained present during the meeting and the brothers exchanged awkward pleasantries [...] "fidgeting all the while, and sometimes one would take hold of the other's hand or the <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> his uniform". It was the last time they saw each other.|$|E

500|$|Although the minigames and {{co-operative}} mode {{were considered}} interesting, the deathmatch mode was criticised for being [...] "slow and clunky". AllGame's McCall {{felt that it}} simply did not work due to the game's unusual manual targeting. Publications also claimed that the controls were complex and confusing. In a negative review, James Bottorff of The Cincinnati Enquirer explained that the control scheme is frustrating because players are required to change from using the analog stick to the C <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> the Nintendo 64 controller when switching to combat mode. GameSpot said that the controls remain responsive at all times, but acknowledged that the alternation between the two control styles [...] "might prove distasteful to some". In a retrospective review, Andy Green of Nintendo Life stated that Jet Force Gemini is [...] "a really enjoyable game" [...] with [...] "its fair share of flaws that tend to hinder the experience a little too much. That being said, it's certainly an incredibly fun title, at its best, that will definitely raise a few smiles".|$|E
500|$|The Frankfurt Parliament had {{declared}} the black-red-gold {{as the official}} colours of the German Confederation, with the red in the tricolour most likely referencing the Hanseatic League, and the gold and black symbolizing Austria as its empire, considered to be [...] "German", had an influence over (what would become) southern Germany. There are many theories in circulation regarding {{the origins of the}} colour scheme used in the 1848 flag. It has been proposed that the colours were those of the Jena Students' League (Jenaer Burschenschaft), one of the radically minded Burschenschaften banned by Metternich in the Carlsbad Decrees; the colours are mentioned in their canonical order in the seventh verse of Daniel August von Binzer's student song Zur Auflösung der Jenaer Burschenschaft ("On the Dissolution of the Jena Students' League") quoted by Johannes Brahms in his Academic Festival Overture. Another claim goes back to the uniforms (mainly black with red facings and gold <b>buttons)</b> <b>of</b> the Lützow Free Corps, comprising mostly university students and formed during the struggle against the occupying forces of Napoleon. [...] Whatever the true explanation, these colours soon came to be regarded as the national colours of Germany during this brief period, and especially after their reintroduction during the Weimar period, they have become synonymous with liberalism in general.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} in the series, WWF SmackDown! had a clear cut system for moves such as {{combining}} an arrow key with the circle button for grappling and moves and combining an arrow key with the X button for striking moves. Most of the later games, from WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 used the aforementioned control scheme. When WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007 was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called [...] "Ultimate Control moves." [...] Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a suplex grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an inverted suplex slam. Before the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, in order for players to force a superstar to submit, they had to tap buttons to move a marker {{towards the end of}} the meter labeled [...] "Submit", and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards [...] "Escape". Included with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the analog sticks of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the submission hold.|$|E

2500|$|In men's fashion, {{the long}} {{redingote}} {{of the era}} of Louis-Philippe (the name came from the English term [...] "riding-coat") was gradually replaced by the jacquette, and then the even shorter veston. [...] The shorter jacket allowed a man to put {{his hands into his}} pockets. [...] The trousers were wide at the waist, and very narrow at the cuffs. Men wore a neutral-colored vest, usually cut low to show off highly decorated shirts with frills and <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> paste jewellery. [...] Men had gloves, but carried them in their hands, according to Gaston Jolivet, a prominent fashion observer of the time, in order [...] "to prove to the population that they had the means to buy a pair of gloves without using them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue was {{the colour}} {{of liberty and}} {{revolution}} in the 18th century, but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority, the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants. It was considered serious and authoritative, without being menacing. In 1829, when Robert Peel created the first London Metropolitan Police, he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark, almost black blue, to make the policemen look different from soldiers, who until then had patrolled the streets. The traditional blue jacket with silver <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> the London [...] "bobbie" [...] was not abandoned until the mid-1990s, when it {{was replaced by a}} light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as NATO blue.|$|E
2500|$|The Nintendo DS {{version of}} Lego Rock Band {{is similar to}} the PlayStation Portable game Rock Band Unplugged and the Nintendo DS version of Rock Band 3. During each song, the player {{switches}} between the various instruments, trying to keep all four members of the band [...] "happy"; this is done by successfully completing a series of notes for the specific instrument, and then correctly hitting a final, purple note to increase that band member's happiness. Band members' happiness will fall over time, requiring the player to continually switch between band members to maintain the band's overall mood and score multiplier. The game uses the touchpad, stylus, and face <b>buttons</b> <b>of</b> the DS, and does not require or support additional peripherals like the console versions do. Up to four people can play at a time, each using a separate DS and playing their own instrument.|$|E
