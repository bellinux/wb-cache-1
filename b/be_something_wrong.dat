5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
500|$|In 1966 Walton {{successfully}} {{underwent surgery}} for lung cancer. Until {{then he had}} been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, The Bear, which was premiered at Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so used to being written off by music critics that he felt [...] "there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> when the worms turned on some praise." [...] Walton received the Order of Merit in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of her debut single [...] "Locomotion" [...] in Australia, Minogue {{traveled}} to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response {{to what he had}} learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia, attractive and very talented, there had to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. After hearing the song, Waterman said [...] "I thought it was fantastic, so I ran over to the DJ and asked him what it was. He said 'Its Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky'." [...] He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit.|$|E
50|$|From a neurobiological perspective, {{there are}} three reasons that could cause a person to have hearing loss: either there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the {{mechanical}} portion of the process, meaning the conductive portions of the ear (external and middle ear), or there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the sensory portion of the process (inner ear or cochlea and related structures) or there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the neural portion of the process, meaning the nerves or brain.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Bolton {{scowled at}} them, feeling {{certain that they}} were godless persons;--in which she was right. The old banker, drawing his son Daniel out of the room, whispered an inquiry; but Daniel Bolton knew nothing. 'There's <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> as to the sale of that mine,' said the banker. Daniel Bolton thought it {{probable}} that there had <b>been</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|R
500|$|On {{arrival at}} Cardiff Central railway station, Friday {{was arrested by}} the British Transport Police for having {{travelled}} from Reading with only a platform ticket. Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody {{and took him to}} Ninian Park to sign the contract. Despite the manner of Friday's arrival, and although he knew there [...] "had to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with him", the Cardiff manager was still happy with his purchase, describing the £28,000 transfer as [...] "an absolute steal". After a long night of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut, Friday lined up against Fulham on 1 January 1977. The Fulham defence included former England captain Bobby Moore, but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals; he also squeezed Moore's testicles during the game as Cardiff won 3–0. Andrews was so happy with Friday's performance that he phoned Hurley two days later, on Monday morning. [...] "Oh, Charlie", Andrews gushed, [...] "he was magnificent. He tore them inside out. ... Moore was chasing him all over the place". The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him. [...] "Jimmy, you've only had him four days", he warned, sombrely: [...] "Give it a few months"...|$|E
500|$|... "Locomotion", Minogue's {{first single}} release, spent seven weeks at {{number one on}} the Australian singles chart, and was the highest-selling single in the country for the 1980s. This version of [...] "Locomotion" [...] is often aired on VH-1 Europe. It, however, was only an Australian release and was not part of her debut album project until re-recorded for release in 1988. [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] was the first single from the album and {{featured}} lyrics written by Mike Stock. Stock believed that although Minogue was a successful soap star in Australia and very talented, there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. It became a number one hit for Minogue in Australia and the United Kingdom. [...] "Got to Be Certain", the second single, reached number one in Australia, and was moderately successful {{in other parts of the}} world, reaching number two in the UK for three weeks and the top ten in Germany and Switzerland. Minogue re-recorded [...] "Locomotion" [...] in April 1988, retitling the song [...] "The Loco-Motion". It was released as the album's third single and became the highest entry of the UK singles chart by a female artist. In North America, it reached number one in Canada and number three on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Je ne sais pas pourquoi", the fourth single, reached number two in the UK. [...] "It's No Secret" [...] was released as the album's fifth single in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, North America, and Japan where it was the fourth single. [...] "Turn It into Love" [...] was exclusively released in Japan as the fifth single and spent 10 weeks at Number 1 with no promotion or video.|$|E
2500|$|Later, however, he {{rejected}} epiphenomenalism. This, he argues, is because when Mary first sees red, she says [...] "wow", {{so it must}} be Mary's qualia that cause her to say [...] "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with it. This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "there must be a reply" [...] reply.|$|E

2500|$|Jutland {{proved to}} be decisive in Beatty's career, despite the loss of two of his battlecruisers. Beatty is {{reported}} to have remarked (to his Flag Captain, Ernle Chatfield, later First Sea Lord in the early 1930s), [...] "there seems to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with our bloody ships today," [...] after two of them had exploded within half an hour during the battle. In any case Beatty's actions succeeded in drawing the German High Seas Fleet into action against the British Grand Fleet.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1974 book Anarchy, State and Utopia philosopher Robert Nozick {{discusses}} an [...] "experience machine", {{a hypothetical}} device which can provide its users with any simulated reality they desire. If given the choice, {{would we want}} to plug ourselves into such a machine? If not, then according to Nozick there seems to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with hedonism, the view that pleasure and happiness are the primary or most important intrinsic goods and the proper aim of human life. Nozick's thought experiment has been widely debated since.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after 16:26, a salvo struck on {{or around}} , which was {{obscured}} by spray and smoke from shell bursts. A signalman promptly leapt {{on to the}} bridge of Lion and announced [...] "Princess Royals blown up, Sir." [...] Beatty famously turned to his flag captain, saying [...] "Chatfield, there seems to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with our bloody ships today." [...] (In popular legend, Beatty also immediately ordered his ships to [...] "turn two points to port", i.e., two points nearer the enemy, {{but there is no}} official record of any such command or course change.) Princess Royal, as it turned out, was still afloat after the spray cleared.|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne has abused {{alcohol and}} other drugs {{for most of his}} adult life. He {{admitted}} to Sounds in 1978, [...] "I get high, I get fucked up ... what the hell's wrong with getting fucked up? There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the system if so many people have to get fucked up ... I never take dope or anything before I go on stage. I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards." [...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were [...] "out for the count". Keyboardist Don Airey said that Osbourne's substance-abuse issues were what caused him to leave the band.|$|E

2500|$|During the First World War Chatfield {{was present}} as Beatty's Flag-Captain in the Lion at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 {{and at the}} Battle of Jutland in May 1916. It was at Jutland, after two British battlecruisers had blown up, that Beatty made his famous remark, [...] "There seems to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with our bloody ships today, Chatfield". Appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Companion on 31 May 1916 and to the Order of the Bath as a Companion in the 1916 Birthday Honours, Chatfield went on to command the {{battleship}} HMS Iron Duke, Beatty's flagship as Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet, in November 1916 and then the battleship , Beatty's new flagship in the same role, in February 1917. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 5 April 1919.|$|E

[...] While Byrnes' colleague, Dianne Butler, said [...] "Sonya's {{wondering how}} long they have to wait before they face the fact there could <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with her. I say no time at all, Sonya. Which explains why she's gardening on her own in those opening credits." [...] When Sonya and Toadie found {{out that they were}} expecting a baby, Claire Crick from All About Soap commented [...] "At last – Sonya and Toadie are having a baby… and we can't think of a soapy couple who deserve such happy news! Not only do we totally love Toadie and Sonya (it's so refreshing seeing a couple who are happy together!), but they're also so clearly desperate to be parents." [...] Crick later praised Sonya for helping Lucas and Vanessa realise their feelings for each other, saying [...] "thank goodness for her meddling ways!" [...] A Newcastle Herald reporter noted that Sonya [...] "has seen more drama than most".|$|E
2500|$|Admiral of the Fleet David Richard Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty [...] (17 January 1871 – 11 March 1936) was a Royal Navy officer. After {{serving in}} the Mahdist War and then the {{response}} to the Boxer Rebellion, he commanded the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, a tactically indecisive engagement after which his aggressive approach was contrasted with the caution of his commander Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He is remembered for his comment at Jutland that [...] "There seems to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with our bloody ships today", after two of his ships exploded. Later in the war he succeeded Jellicoe as Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, in which capacity he received the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet {{at the end of the}} war. He then followed Jellicoe's path a second time, serving as First Sea Lord—a position that Beatty held longer (7 years 9 months) than any other First Sea Lord in history. [...] While First Sea Lord, he was involved in negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 in which it was agreed that the United States, Britain and Japan should set their navies in a ratio of 5:5:3, with France and Italy maintaining smaller ratio fleets of 1.75 each.|$|E
