40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{acquired}} credit unions and analyze their financial performance {{up to six}} years prior to merger, on a quarterly basis. The primary focus is on <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> (<b>asset</b> liability management) and profitability variables (return on assets). We find that acquired credit unions during the period 2008 (third quarter) to 2014 (first quarter) experienced negative return on assets for several quarters prior to their takeover. This {{was the result of}} a declining loan portfolio and increasing charge offs. In spite of decreasing lending activity, such credit unions continued to increase their deposits, i. e., adding to their cost base. Due to declining loans, their net interest margin as a proportion of deposits was also in decline. We argue that this is an indicator of poor management ability. Furthermore, our analysis finds that operating expenses were increasing over time, something that has been documented in previous literature also for smaller credit unions and is attributable to lack of economies of scale. The average asset size of the acquired credit unions in our sample is about $ 22 million just before acquisition. We attribute our findings to poor business strategy followed by such credit unions. We also conclude that signs of trouble are evident up to two years before merger on average and regulatory policy may have to become more proactive to manage the consolidation challenge faced by the credit union industry in general...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to see whether large asset growth {{expansions}} or contractions are related to momentum effect. In momentum strategy, past winner stocks are bought and past loser stocks are sold in order to profit from momentum anomaly. DATA AND METHODOLOGY Data is retrieved from the Thomson- Reuter Datastream/WorldScope database. The sample covers all firms that have existed during July 1985 and June 2015 from particular stock markets of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom as well as Canada and Japan. Two-tailed t-tests are conducted in Stata to measure the return differences of different stock portfolios formed from this data. In the first test, stock portfolios are sorted into three groups (low, middle, high) based on prior asset growth for countries {{in order to see}} if the returns are lower in high asset growth groups. In the second test, stock portfolios are sorted into three groups (low, middle, high) based on past 11 -month returns for countries in order to see whether the past winners (high group) outperform the past losers (low group). In the third test, stocks are grouped into asset growth groups (low, middle, high) in order to see is there momentum effect present in the low and high asset growth groups. Finally, OLS regressions are conducted for each country with the aggregate momentum profits as the dependent variable and lagged aggregate asset growth rate as the explanatory variable. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY The results show that there is an asset growth effect present in most of the countries of the sample but the momentum effect was not significantly present. The key finding is that, there are significant momentum profits in the highest asset growth rate group and often in the low asset growth rate groups as well. This is in line with Nyberg and Pöyry (2014), who find that the momentum effect is strong when there are large asset expansions and contractions.

40|$|Inquiries {{about this}} {{document}} {{can be made}} to HARC@hawaii. edu Agency theory suggests that, when agency costs are high, creditors place more weight on the value of assets as recorded on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> (“recorded” <b>assets)</b> and less weight on assets that are valued by capital providers but not recorded on the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> (“unrecorded” <b>assets).</b> The essence of the argument is that <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> recorded <b>assets</b> {{are more likely to be}} recoverable if there is a default. However, extant evidence is not consistent with this suggestion when contract maturity is used as a proxy for agency costs. We provide an explanation for this apparent anomaly. We show that the sensitivity of credit default swap (CDS) spreads (which are an indicator of credit risk) to changes in unrecorded assets increases with the maturity of the CDS while the sensitivity to change in recorded assets does not change with maturity. That is, unrecorded assets affect the CDS market’s assessment of future cash flows available for principal and interest payments more so in the long term than in the short term. We attribute this increase in sensitivity to a longer time horizon and higher projected growth rates in the future cash flows generated by unrecorded assets...|$|R
