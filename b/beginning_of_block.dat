30|$|As {{far as the}} {{imperfect}} CSI case is concerned, we restrict {{our attention}} to only block fading channels with F blocks and quasi-static fading with F[*]=[*] 1. The reason is that channel estimation {{is assumed to be}} obtained via a pilot-based approach for[23], which is clearly not compatible with fully interleaved Rayleigh fading. The channel gain is assumed to be constant over one block and is assumed to change independently from block to block. In our setting, a codeword covers F blocks, and the relay estimates the error probability of the whole codeword based on the knowledge of the channel gains <b>of</b> all <b>blocks</b> (see section 5 below). These channel gains are estimated via a pilot message, which is inserted at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> each <b>block,</b> and transmitted via BPSK modulation.|$|R

Upon receiving the pulse, the destination declares the chosen relay [3]. It is observed that the end-to-end performance of relayed symbols {{is determined by the}} weaker between source-relay and relay-destination connections.
