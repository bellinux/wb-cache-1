60|$|Is, then, the {{difference}} between the Just and the Expedient a merely imaginary distinction? Have mankind been under a delusion in thinking that justice is a more sacred thing than policy, and that the latter ought only to be listened to after the former has been satisfied? By no means. The exposition we have given of the nature and origin of the sentiment, recognises a real distinction; and no one of those who profess the most sublime contempt for the consequences of actions as an element in their morality, attaches more importance to the distinction than I do. While I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an imaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the justice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and incomparably the most sacred and <b>binding</b> <b>part,</b> of all morality. Justice is a name for certain classes of moral rules, which concern the essentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore of more absolute obligation, than any other rules for the guidance of life; and the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of justice, that of a right residing in an individual, implies and testifies to this more binding obligation.|$|E

40|$|We have {{purified}} proteins of 70 kD from Drosophila, HeLa cells, and Z. mays {{that specifically}} bind nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). These proteins are recognized by antibodies raised against a previously identified NLS-binding protein (NBP) from the yeast S. cerevisiae.

The requirement for NBPs in nuclear protein uptake is demonstrated in semipermeabilized Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells. Proper import of a fluorescent protein containing the large T antigen NLS requires cytosol and ATP. In the absence of cytosol and/or ATP, NLS- containing proteins are bound to cytosolic structures and the nuclear envelope. Addition of cytosol and ATP results in movement of this bound intermediate into the nucleus. Anti-NBP antibodies specifically inhibited the <b>binding</b> <b>part</b> of this import reaction.

40|$|The CDR- 3 {{region of}} CD 4 has been {{proposed}} {{to be involved in}} the fusion reaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and CD 4 + cells, either at a stage involving virus binding or subsequent to virus <b>binding.</b> <b>Part</b> of the evidence for this has been the observation that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to CDR- 3 block HIV infection potently without strongly inhibiting the binding of monomeric gp 120 to CD 4. Here I show that, in a system using oligomeric, virion-bound gp 120, a MAb to CDR- 3 resembles those to CDR- 2 in that it inhibits soluble CD 4 binding to virions. Consequently, ternary complexes of MAb-soluble CD 4 -gp 120 cannot be detected with CDR- 2 MAbs and are detectable only at a very low level with a CDR- 3 MAb, but they clearly form when a control MAb to CD 4 domain 4 is used.

This site is a unique Trp-Trp peptide bond located within the juxtamembrane segment of VAMP which is essential for neurotransmitter release.

In this thesis three different protein components of the bacterial protein synthesis system have been structurally studied. Ribosome recycling factor (RRF) {{is essential for the}} recycling step of the translation cycle, elongation factor SelB is a specialised elongation factor needed for co-translational selenocysteine incorporation, and ribosomal protein L 1 is a primary binding protein in ribosome assembly. The structure of RRF from Thermotoga maritima was solved by X-ray crystallography. RRF is an L-shaped molecule with size and shape very similar to tRNA. This similarity in combination with data from the literature suggests that RRF can bind similarly to a tRNA to the ribosomal A-site.

It recognizes a variety of nuclear transcripts produced by all three RNA polymerases, adds short poly(A) tails to aberrant or unstable RNAs and activates the exosome for their degradation. Despite the advances in understanding the structural features of the isolated complex subunits or their fragments, the details of complex assembly, RNA recognition and exosome activation remain poorly understood. Here we provide the first understanding of the RNA binding mode of the complex. We show that Air 2 p is an RNA-binding subunit of TRAMP. We identify the zinc knuckles (ZnK) 2, 3 and 4 as the RNA-binding domains, and reveal the essentiality of ZnK 4 for TRAMP 4 polyadenylation activity. Furthermore, we identify Air 2 p as the key component of TRAMP 4 assembly providing bridging between Mtr 4 p and Trf 4 p.

Crystal structures of regulatory and catalytic subunits bound together in a holoenzyme have been solved, leading to questions about the roles of specific residues at this interface. Although this extended hydrophobic interface is conserved in both RI and RII subunits, there are isoform-specifc differences, and these contribute to functional differences in the two isoforms. Additionally, there are conserved features in the PBC and B/C helix whose roles in activation are not fully understood. Using a variety of biophysical methods, here I report distinct isoform roles for phosphate binding cassette tyrosines in RIalpha and RIIbeta R-subunits of PKA, which contribute to the hydrophobic interface.
