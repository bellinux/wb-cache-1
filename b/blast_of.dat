5|$|The {{winds of}} Donna {{can be seen}} in the feature film <b>Blast</b> <b>of</b> Silence (1961); a fist fight scene on Long Island had been {{previously}} scheduled, and the filmmakers decided to go ahead and shoot the exterior scene despite the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X2 adds a {{new feature}} to the series: a burst gauge, which is {{fulfilled}} as the player causes or receives damage. By pressing buttons in combination, the player character jump and unleash a <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> energy—a Psyche Burst. It allows the player to break combinations and super {{moves in the}} middle of the opponent's offensive. Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Protestant writers at {{the time}} took a highly {{negative}} view. By the 17th century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet Bloody Mary. John Knox attacked her in his First <b>Blast</b> <b>of</b> the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women (1558), and she was prominently vilified in Actes and Monuments (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E

5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Although the scholar-officials viewed {{military}} {{soldiers as}} lower {{members in the}} hierarchic social order, a person could gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer {{with a record of}} victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and 'fire lances' that discharged a gunpowder <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> flame and shrapnel.|$|E
5|$|Anakin informs Jedi Master Mace Windu of Palpatine's treachery. With {{two other}} Jedi masters at his side, Windu {{attempts}} to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at him, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's {{face into the}} gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. Just as Windu is about to dispatch Palpatine, Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith lord's behalf, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu with another <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> lightning. Anakin then pledges himself {{to the dark side}} as Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.|$|E

5|$|As the protoss {{celebrate}} their victory, however, Artanis and Jim Raynor are summoned by Kerrigan to Ulnar, the former Xel'Naga homeworld, which contains a gateway into the Void; Kerrigan seeks their help in going through and ending Amon {{once and for}} all. Fighting through Amon's minions, led by a reincarnated Duran/Narud, the trio release an imprisoned Xel'Naga named Ouros, who had appeared to both Zeratul and Artanis {{in the form of}} their deceased friend Tassadar to guide them towards his intended aim: For Kerrigan to ascend to become Xel'Naga herself, and use her powers to kill Amon, as only a Xel'Naga could defeat him for good. With the aid of Artanis and Raynor's armies, Kerrigan undergoes the ascension, and destroys Amon forever with a final <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> energy.|$|E
5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with a <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E

5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E
5|$|Using {{the device}} he created earlier, Doom betrays Hager and steals the board from the compound, killing {{most of the}} Army {{personnel}} there. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai. During the battle, Sue is severely wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the now cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and Ben Grimm uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor. However, Galactus arrives and Sue appears to die in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains control of his board, restoring his power. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying, with an extra boost from Johnny, into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> energy that engulfs Galactus, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer's board.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E

5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency {{to the search}} for Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E
