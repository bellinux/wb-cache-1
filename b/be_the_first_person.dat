5|$|Some {{clinical}} {{symptoms and}} signs {{have been named}} after Hippocrates as he is believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to describe those. Hippocratic face is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. Clubbing, a deformity of the fingers and fingernails, {{is also known as}} Hippocratic fingers. Hippocratic succussion is the internal splashing noise of hydropneumothorax or pyopneumothorax. Hippocratic bench (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage are two devices named after Hippocrates. Hippocratic Corpus and Hippocratic Oath are also his namesakes. The drink hypocras is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates. Risus sardonicus, a sustained spasming of the face muscles may also be termed the Hippocratic Smile.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner of which would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He {{wrote a letter to}} Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} other Papuan groups, the Urapmin {{consider}} the owner of an object or land to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to create or work it. This is taken {{to the extent that}} every object in a household is considered to have an owner, and some households have even divided their shared gardens into individually owned plots. According to the traditional beliefs of the Urapmin, this fits into a general worldview where everything had an owner, either human or spirit.|$|E
25|$|When King Prajadhipok later abdicated, {{since he}} was the last {{remaining}} son of Queen Saovabha, the crown went back to the sons of the queen whose rank was next to hers: Queen Savang Vadhana, mother of the late Crown Prince Vajirunahis. Besides the late crown prince, she had two more sons who survived to adulthood: Prince Sommatiwongse Varodaya of Nakhon Si Thammarat, who had died without a son in 1899, and Prince Mahidol who, although deceased, had two living sons. It thus appeared that Prince Ananda Mahidol would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> in the royal line of succession.|$|E

25|$|Scholars who favoured Irish {{parallels}} directly {{spoke out}} against pro-Scandinavian theories, citing them as unjustified. Wilhelm Grimm is noted to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to link Beowulf with Irish folklore; however, Max Deutschbein is {{the first person to}} present the argument in academic form. He suggested the Irish Feast of Bricriu as a source for Beowulf—a theory that was soon denied by Oscar Olson. Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm Von Sydow argued against both Scandinavian translation and source material due to his theory that Beowulf is fundamentally Christian and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been pagan.|$|E
25|$|Both complementarians and egalitarians see Jesus as {{treating}} {{women with}} compassion, grace and dignity. The gospels of the New Testament, especially Luke, mention Jesus speaking to or helping women publicly and openly. Martha's sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet being taught, a privilege reserved {{for men in}} Judaism. Jesus had female followers who were his sponsors, and he stopped to express concern for the women of Jerusalem {{on his way to}} be crucified. Mary Magdalene is stated in the Gospels to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to see Jesus after his resurrection. In the narratives, Jesus charged her to tell others of what she had seen, even though the testimony of a woman at that time was not considered valid.|$|E
25|$|In sources, Ardashir's {{religious}} {{relations and}} his father being a cleric are mentioned; {{so it can be}} deduced that Ardashir had no connections with royal houses and was only a cleric's son who knew about religion, but was not a cleric himself; and that was how he, by his religious knowledge, found the chance to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> in his inscriptions receiving the royal ring from Ahura Mazda, something a Persian nobleman did not need and only a newcomer had to claim to be from the line of gods. It should be mentioned that it was not precedent to Ardashir to take a royal ring from Ahura Mazda, and it is not seen even in Achaemenid inscriptions.|$|E

Another place associated with Prithu is Prithudaka (lit. [...] "Prithu's pool"), a town on banks of Sarasvati river, where Prithu is believed to have performed the Shraddha of his father. The town is referred as the boundary between Northern and central India and referred to by Patanjali as the modern Pehowa.|$|E
500|$|Kanye West would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to {{tell you}} he belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't [...] He fought for {{his place in the}} {{cultural}} pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): [...] "We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think." [...] But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process. Kanye's been playing the long game all along, and we're only just beginning to see why.|$|E

[...] Between 1996 and 2000 his team had won 12 of 17 tournaments that they had entered. He scored the game-winning basket of Chicago's three-on-three basketball tournament on a team with Arne Duncan, Robinson, and Kit Mueller. [...] Rogers and Robinson were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback. He claims to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> to have beaten Jordan {{in a game of}} one-on-one at one of his fantasy basketball camps.

500|$|The band {{recorded}} demos at DML Studios, a small practice {{studio in}} Escondido, California, where the band had written Dude Ranch and Enema of the State.

DeVoe sat {{in the control room}} and quietly listened to the recordings, and pressed the band at the end on why there was no [...] "Blink-182 good-time summer anthem [...] ". DeLonge and Hoppus were furious, remarking, [...] "You want a fucking single? I'll write you the cheesiest, catchiest, throwaway fucking summertime single you've ever heard!" [...] Hoppus went home and wrote lead single [...] "The Rock Show" [...] in ten minutes, and DeLonge similarly wrote [...] "First Date", which became the most successful singles from the record and future live staples.|$|E
500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong {{as a person}} who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography.|$|E
