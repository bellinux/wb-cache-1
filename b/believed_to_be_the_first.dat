5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded a pension, <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E

5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} bascule bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it was <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks {{in the vicinity of}} the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> steel {{box girder bridge}} built in the United States, and is {{considered}} a prototype of the cable-stayed bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden. Similar bridges include a timber-stayed bridge designed in Germany in 1784, the wrought-iron stayed Albert Bridge in London designed in 1873, and the Chow Chow Bridge in Grays Harbor County. The bridge was listed on the Washington Heritage Register on January 25, 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{ancient city}} {{off the coast}} of Bet Dwarka has been proposed to be developed as a scuba diving site. This project is a joint initiative of Adventure Sports Ltd (ASL) and the Government of Gujarat, with investment of ₹13 crore. This is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> effort anywhere in the world to exploit a submerged city for tourism. Water and beach sports are also being promoted by the state government, and there are proposals to further promote aero and submarine sports.|$|E
5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} of research, Kaspersky {{authored}} papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats. Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments {{ideas on how to}} sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus {{at the request of the}} International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E

5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's oath {{of office}} to a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples {{to ask her to}} officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Cabeza de Vaca {{is thought}} to have been the first European to sight the bay in the early 16th century, {{evidenced}} by the descriptions in his logs that match the detail of the area. In 1766, Spaniard Diego Ortiz Parrilla is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> European to explore the bay. He named it Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic), but it was later changed to Copano, after the port of Copano was officially opened in 1785 on the northwestern shore. The port later served as a strategically important locale during the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, and was the site of a settlement that is now completely abandoned. The town of St. Mary's of Aransas was founded southwest of Copano and thrived as a port and wood mart, until numerous shipwrecks caused by the bay's hidden reefs concluded its use in 1875. Like Copano, it is now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1689, William III {{moved his}} {{residence}} to Kensington Palace {{on the far}} side of Hyde Park and had a drive laid out across its southern edge which was known as the King's Private Road. The drive is still in existence as a wide straight gravelled carriage track leading west from Hyde Park Corner across the southern boundary of Hyde Park towards Kensington Palace and now known as Rotten Row, possibly a corruption of rotteran (to muster), Ratten Row (roundabout way), Route du roi, or rotten (the soft material with which the road is covered). It is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> road in London to be lit at night, which was done to deter highwaymen. In 1749, Horace Walpole was robbed while travelling through the park from Holland House. The row was used by the wealthy for horseback rides in the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required to}} import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction {{on the rest of the}} house was finished. Federal Hill was once <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In an August 3, 1973, {{memo to the}} Atari {{engineering}} department, co-founder Nolan Bushnell {{laid out}} plans {{for the company to}} create a prototype 20-player version of Gotcha in time for a trade show later that year, though no such game was ever made. Instead, released {{at the same time as}} Gotcha and showcased at the early November 1973 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition were two additional versions of Gotcha: one with a tinted color overlay, and a true multi-color version of Gotcha with red, blue, and green colors. The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and {{excerpts from the}} opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer {{at a time when}} any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E
