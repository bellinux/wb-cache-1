5|$|Monster {{was founded}} in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with {{different}} copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in <b>bank</b> <b>financing.</b> Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, the {{industry}} came under financial stress {{due to that}} year's economic crisis. Motorists drove less and gasoline prices dropped sharply, while <b>bank</b> <b>financing</b> shrank. As a result, some plants operated below capacity, several firms closed plants, others laid off staff, some firms went bankrupt, plant projects were suspended and market prices declined. The Energy Information Administration raised concerns that the industry would not meet the legislated targets.|$|E
25|$|To back up {{the impact}} of the price shocks, the {{government}} declared that it would keep its own expenditure within the limit of current revenue and stop the other two large streams of Central Bank credit creation: Central <b>Bank</b> <b>financing</b> for agricultural credit and for the system of subsidies supporting differential exchange rates. The multiple exchange rates in effect under García were to be unified, and the unified rate was to be determined by market forces. Further, competition from imports to restrain inflation and access to imported supplies for production would both be improved by taking away quantitative restrictions and reducing tariff rates.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of Chinese {{state-owned}} enterprises spanning 1980 to 1994, we investigate the factors that determine the sources of finance for firm-level fixed investment, including retained earnings, <b>bank</b> <b>finance,</b> and government transfers. Direct government transfers were not significantly associated with profitability throughout the period. In contrast, <b>bank</b> <b>finance</b> was positively linked to both profitability and some types of reform. Reforms that enabled managers to self-select, and thus expose themselves (and their employees) to greater risk, were positively associated with acquiring <b>bank</b> <b>finance.</b> The association between <b>bank</b> <b>finance</b> and profitability weakened in the 1990 s as banks increasingly assumed bailout responsibility...|$|R

500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining <b>bank</b> <b>financing</b> in a real estate {{transaction}} and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it... I think the candidacy opened a door for women in national politics, and I don't regret that for one minute. I'm proud of that. But I just wish it could have been done in a different way." ...|$|E
500|$|Cade {{patented}} {{the formula}} and offered all {{the rights to}} the drink to the University of Florida in exchange for the university's backing of the production and marketing of the drink, but the university turned down his proposal. He initially obtained <b>bank</b> <b>financing</b> and began to produce [...] "Gatorade" [...] through his own business, but later entered into a contract with Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. to produce and sell the drink. When sales royalties reached $200,000, the university took notice. The Florida Board of Regents, prompted by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which had provided Cade with a small grant for his research, asked for the patent rights. Cade refused. The Board of Regents, acting on behalf of the university, then brought suit against Cade for a share of the profits, arguing that the university's facilities, employees and students were instrumental {{in the development of the}} product. After thirty-one months of legal wrangling, Cade and the university negotiated a settlement of their dispute in 1972, and the Board of Regents and the university settled for a twenty percent share of the royalties. Cade, and his investors in the Gatorade Trust, retained eighty percent. In the aftermath of the settlement, Cade and the university resolved their differences amicably, and expanded their professional relationships—of the first $70,500 in Gatorade royalties received by the university, the university reinvested $30,000 in kidney research by Cade's renal department and another $12,000 in Cade's other research projects. Cade, for his part, created multiple scholarships and contributed generously to the university from his own royalties over the following years.|$|E

2500|$|In larger transactions, {{sometimes}} {{all or part}} of these two debt types is replaced by high yield bonds. Depending {{on the size of the}} acquisition, debt as well as equity can be provided by more than one party. In larger transactions, debt is often syndicated, meaning that the bank who arranges the credit sells {{all or part of}} the debt in pieces to other banks in an attempt to diversify and hence reduce its risk. Another form of debt that is used in LBOs are seller notes (or vendor loans) in which the seller effectively uses parts of the proceeds of the sale to grant a loan to the purchaser. Such seller notes are often employed in management buyouts or in situations with very restrictive <b>bank</b> <b>financing</b> environments. Note that in close to all cases of LBOs, the only collateralization available for the debt are the assets and cash flows of the company. The financial sponsor can treat their investment as common equity or preferred equity among other types of securities. [...] Preferred equity can pay a dividend and has payment preferences to common equity.|$|E
2500|$|Rural areas In {{terms of}} rural and small town infrastructure, {{channeling}} {{funds to the}} final users through the various layers of local government remains a challenge. According to the World Bank, China differs from many other developing countries in {{that there is not}} a history of the central government providing large subsidies for the financing of rural water supply and sanitation. Instead, there is greater emphasis on self-reliance with rural people using their own contributions and resources to improve their water supply. This financing structure causes poor rural areas to [...] "accurately match their ability to pay with the proper type of systems and level of service", i.e. to choose sanitation solutions that they can afford. According to the World Bank, as a result, [...] "China is held up as a model for other developing countries". Support for capital costs for water supply is partially provided by the local and/or provincial government. Beneficiaries have to provide upfront capital contributions. Through World <b>Bank</b> <b>financing</b> and central government counterpart financing these upfront capital contributions were reduced, thus making sanitation more affordable to the poor. According to The Economist magazine, [...] "some provinces are now bypassing both the prefectural- and township-level governments in order to get funds more directly to rural areas." ...|$|E
