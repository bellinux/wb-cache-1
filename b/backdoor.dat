5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a <b>backdoor</b> {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a <b>backdoor</b> and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a <b>backdoor,</b> although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

5|$|KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, {{who would}} be {{introduced}} in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did {{not appear in the}} <b>backdoor</b> pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the <b>backdoor</b> pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The drama was titled Private Practice, and its premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to Private Practice. The series ended its run in January 2013 after six seasons.|$|E
30|$|Authentication: To {{guarantee}} {{the security of}} the communications in our schemes, a requester and a responder have to be authenticated by each other. Furthermore, we need to ensure that messages received by the requester/responder have not been modified during the transmission. Finally, a new attack called <b>backdoored</b> pseudorandom generators is exposed [39] recently. If an entity&#x 2019;s chosen random number generator is <b>backdoored,</b> then an attacker may violate the security of a scheme. We require that if a <b>backdoored</b> pseudorandom generator is selected, then the authentication property still holds.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} formal {{treatment}} of <b>backdoored</b> pseudorandom generators (PRGs). Here a saboteur chooses a PRG instance {{for which she}} knows a trapdoor that allows prediction of future (and possibly past) generator outputs. This topic was formally studied by Vazirani and Vazirani, but only in a limited form {{and not in the}} context of subverting cryptographic protocols. The latter has become increasingly important due to revelations about NISTâ€™s <b>backdoored</b> Dual EC PRG and new results about its practical exploitability using a trapdoor. We show that <b>backdoored</b> PRGs are equivalent to public-key encryption schemes with pseu-dorandom ciphertexts. We use this equivalence to build <b>backdoored</b> PRGs that avoid a well known drawback of the Dual EC PRG, namely biases in outputs that an attacker can exploit without the trapdoor. Our results also yield a number of new constructions and an explanatory framework for why there are no reported observations in the wild of <b>backdoored</b> PRGs using only symmetric primitives. We also investigate folklore suggestions for countermeasures to <b>backdoored</b> PRGs, which we call immunizers. We show that simply hashing PRG outputs is not an effective immunizer against an attacker that knows the hash function in use. Salting the hash, however, does yield a secure immunizer, a fact we prove using a surprisingly subtle proof in the random oracle model. We also give a proof in the standard model under the assumption that the hash function is a universal computational extractor (a recent notion introduced by Bellare, Tung, and Keelveedhi). ...|$|R

Pyun said that Hawaiian film star Mark Dacascos was interested in playing the character of Max Havoc, but that he backed out after anthrax appeared in Florida.

40|$|This work {{presents}} mathematical {{properties of}} the RSA cryptosystem. The topics of backdoors and padding algorithm are developped. For padding schemes, we give a practical instantiation with a security reduction. It {{is based on the}} compression function of SHA- 1 without any chaining function. Our solution has the advantage over the previous one of removing the relation of the output length of the compression function to the length of the RSA modulus. For backdoors, improvements on definitions, existing algorithms as well as extensions of existing theorems are shown. The definitions pertaining to <b>backdoored</b> key generators are improved as to make their analysis uniform and comparable. New algorithms are presented and compared to existing ones as to show improvements mainly on their running time, the indistinguishability of the keys produced, and that some of these new algorithms are, for all practical purposes, the best that may be called asymmetric. Our theorem on the correctness (or completeness) of one of our better <b>backdoored</b> key generators is a generalization of a theorem of Boneh, Durfee and Frankel's on partial information on the decryption exponent...|$|R
