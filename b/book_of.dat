5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead was updated, {{revised and}} standardised. Spells were {{consistently}} ordered and numbered {{for the first}} time. This standardised version is known today as the 'Saite recension', after the Saite (26th) dynasty. In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Breathing and <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Traversing Eternity. The last use of the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E
5|$|Many {{histories}} of previous dynasties were compiled between 636 and 659 by court officials during {{and shortly after}} the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang. These included the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Liang, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Chen, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Northern Qi, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Zhou, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Sui, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Jin, History of Northern Dynasties and the History of Southern Dynasties. Although {{not included in the}} official Twenty-Four Histories, the Tongdian and Tang Huiyao were nonetheless valuable written historical works of the Tang period. The Shitong written by Liu Zhiji in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of Chinese historiography in past centuries until his time. The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, compiled by Bianji, recounted the journey of Xuanzang, the Tang era's most renowned Buddhist monk.|$|E

5|$|Rand and Robyn Miller both {{wanted to}} develop Mysts back story into novels. After {{the success of}} Myst, {{publisher}} Hyperion signed a three-book, US$1 million deal with the brothers. David Wingrove worked from the Miller brothers' story outlines. The three books, entitled Myst: The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Atrus, Myst: The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Ti'ana, and Myst: The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> D'ni, were released in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. The books were later packaged together as The Myst Reader. A fourth novel, entitled Myst: The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Marrim, is planned.|$|E
5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} of four books: The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Satan, The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lucifer, The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Belial, and The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan. The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen sets of Song {{printed books}} have been {{designated}} as National Treasures.

They cover mainly Chinese Classics such as books and commentaries on Records of the Grand Historian, the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Han, the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Later Han, Classic of History, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Rites, <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Songs or the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Changes.

5|$|A <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E

5|$|Aquino's <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E

5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him.
