5|$|Although most residences {{were built}} {{according}} to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a <b>building</b> <b>code</b> that prohibited wooden houses, {{and a number of}} large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros and Kongsberg.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies of}} the {{events leading up to}} the tragedy found several factors {{contributing}} to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. They tended to be of poor construction and did not conform to proper <b>building</b> <b>code,</b> nor had they been adequately examined.|$|E
50|$|The California <b>Building</b> Standards <b>Code,</b> is the {{foundation}} for the design and implementation of <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> within California. The <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> include the implementation of improved safety methods, sustainability measures, consistency, new technology and construction methods, and reliability. These codes are revamped every 18 months through the Triennial and Intervening Code Adoption Cycle. These implementations are paramount to the development of <b>building</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the model <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> has {{successfully}} been applied since the early 1900s in the countries where regulation of building construction is a responsibility of the local authorities. The popularity of model <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> {{can be attributed to}} two factors: (a) the developing of proprietary <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> is prohibitively expensive and (b) the ability of the model codes to accommodate local conditions. Since modern building regulations are very complex, their development and effective maintenance are far beyond the technical and financial capabilities of most jurisdictions. Rather than drafting its own <b>building</b> <b>codes,</b> a local authority might choose to use the model <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> instead. The model <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> are either adopted (accepted without modifications) or adapted (modified) to a particular jurisdiction and then enforced by the adopting authority.|$|R

5|$|Since Manila {{is prone}} to earthquakes, the Spanish colonial architects invented the style called Earthquake Baroque which the churches and {{government}} buildings during the Spanish colonial period adopted. As a result, succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 19th centuries barely affected Manila, although it did periodically level the surrounding area. Modern buildings in and around Manila are designed or have been retrofitted to withstand an 8.2 magnitude quake in accordance to the country's <b>building</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
5|$|The city of San Francisco {{notified}} the Mallochs {{that they were}} in violation of a <b>building</b> <b>code</b> prohibiting more than three floors above a garage, because the building contained four floors of apartments above the garage. The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above the garage. No part of the building was in violation of the code.|$|E
5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working drawings that would meet <b>building</b> <b>code</b> specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, impractical artist.|$|E
50|$|The CDB {{contains}} a Division of <b>Building</b> <b>Codes</b> and Regulations. In two areas, plumbing and energy conservation, {{the state of}} Illinois has adopted statewide mandates for the local <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> of Illinois. In addition, the Division serves as a repository and informational clearinghouse for the county and municipal <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> adopted by local governmental ordinance throughout Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of developing, approving, and enforcing <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> varies considerably among nations. In some countries <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> are {{developed by the}} government agencies or quasi-governmental standards organizations and then enforced across the country by the central government. Such codes are known as the national <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide application).|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{decreasing}} of Korean domestic construction {{markets and}} increasing of global construction markets, oversee expansion in construction industry becomes more important. In global construction markets, developing countries which comprise major market share, need <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> for their construction industry. Advanced country, America and European Union, use their <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> {{to promote their}} construction industry in developing countries. To establish Korean <b>Building</b> <b>Codes</b> spread strategies, advanced countries <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> were researched. They were spread by high ratio in construction industry, and demand for new technology, such as, Green Buildings. Apply these strategies in Korean <b>Building</b> <b>Codes,</b> Middle-East Asia and South-East Asia were chosen, for high percentages in local construction industry. As the population in Middle-East Asia and South-East Asia growth increasingly, educational, medical and environmental facilities are needed. To accomodate these facilities, proper <b>building</b> <b>codes</b> should be established. ? ??? ????? ????????? ????

5|$|When One Meridian Plaza {{was built}} Philadelphia was {{enforcing}} a <b>building</b> <b>code</b> from 1949 that made {{no distinction between}} high-rises and other buildings. In 1984 Philadelphia adopted new codes that required automatic sprinkler systems in all new buildings. At the time of construction, sprinklers were only built on the service levels below ground. In 1988 plans {{were put in place}} to have automatic sprinklers placed throughout the building by November 1993. By 1991 four floors were completely protected by sprinklers and in part on three other floors. The sprinklers had been installed during floor renovations at the request of tenants and the building's owners had plans to install more as other floors were renovated.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home <b>Building</b> <b>Code</b> was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

50|$|Sprinklers may be {{required}} to be installed by <b>building</b> <b>codes,</b> or may be recommended by insurance companies to reduce potential property losses or business interruption. <b>Building</b> <b>codes</b> in the United States for places of assembly, generally over 100 persons, and places with overnight sleeping accommodation such as hotels, nursing homes, dormitories, and hospitals usually require sprinklers either under local <b>building</b> <b>codes,</b> as a condition of receiving State and Federal funding or as a requirement to obtain certification (essential for institutions who wish to train medical staff).|$|R
