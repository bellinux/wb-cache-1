5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> a pair of LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned {{in addition to the}} Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|At Euston, major {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} undertaken {{to incorporate the}} new Victoria line platforms so that cross-platform interchanges could <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> the Northern line's Bank branch—the former C route to King's Cross and Bank. Unlike the former CCE platforms, which were in separate tunnels with side platforms, the Bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide cross-platform interchange, a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound Bank branch trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new Bank branch tunnels. Each pair of platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators.|$|E
5|$|Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers {{additional}} powers on the Minister for Home Affairs {{to prevent}} subversion.

5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E

5|$|In late 1994, {{the power}} station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This {{led to a}} sea defence system being {{constructed}} to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington Colliery. Tipped waste from the colliery had {{been used as a}} coastal defence measure, but as the colliery had closed, waste was no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required a £2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, {{the wife}} of the brothers' European {{business}} agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur—one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn. Wilbur also became acquainted with Léon Bollée and his family. Bollée was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> hired assistance. Bollée would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollée had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier FA2 {{featured}} the Blue Vixen radar, which {{was described as}} one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world; the Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement. The Blue Vixen formed the basis for development of the Eurofighter Typhoon's CAPTOR radar. The Sea Harrier FA2 also carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2; in response to the threat of radar-based anti aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increase to the air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.|$|E

5|$|The first {{dealt with}} the Strand branch: it {{confirmed}} {{the layout of the}} junction between the branch and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend the branch south under the River Thames to the London and South Western Railway's (L's) terminus at Waterloo station. The extension included moving Strand station to the corner of Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel from there to the BS's Waterloo station which would <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> additional lifts to serve the GNP's platforms. The branch was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station. The junction layout and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo. The bill received royal assent on 4 August 1905 as the Great Northern Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1905.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} adjacent to Muhammad's house; he settled there after his Hijra (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE. He {{shared in the}} heavy work of construction. The original mosque was an open-air building. The mosque served as a community center, a court, and a religious school. There was a raised platform {{for the people who}} taught the Quran. Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated it. In 1909, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> electrical lights. The mosque is {{under the control of the}} Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The mosque is located in what was traditionally the center of Medina, with many hotels and old markets nearby. It is a major pilgrimage site. Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj go on to Medina to visit the mosque due to its connections to the life of Muhammad.|$|E
