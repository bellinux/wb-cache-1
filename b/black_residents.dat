5|$|The area's {{demographics}} {{changed as}} a result of the riot. Many <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> left Manhattan permanently (many moving to Brooklyn). By 1865, the black population fell below 10,000, equivalent to the number in 1820.|$|E
5|$|These {{setbacks}} to {{the black}} population in New Orleans corresponded {{with a large number}} of educated white arrivals, contributing to a high rate of business formation in the city. These newcomers have had the effect of driving up housing prices, making rent less affordable for the majority <b>black</b> <b>residents.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 175,000 <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> {{departed}} New Orleans {{over the}} year following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact {{has been on the}} middle-class blacks, given that most black professionals are older and more advanced in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white.|$|E

5|$|Omaha has the fifth-highest African-American {{poverty rate}} among the nation's 100 largest cities, {{with more than}} one in three <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> in Omaha living below the poverty line. The {{percentage}} of black children in Omaha who live in poverty rank ranks number one in the United States, with nearly six of 10 black kids living below the poverty line. Only one other metropolitan area in the U.S., Minneapolis, has a wider economic disparity between blacks and whites.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war brought {{national}} attention to Oak Ridge, and there was bad publicity about the conditions that the <b>Black</b> <b>residents</b> were living in. Roane-Anderson dusted off plans for a village for them. The new village, called Scarboro, was built where the Gamble Valley Trailer Camp had once stood. Construction commenced in 1948, and the first residents moved in two years later. It housed the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Whites in Omaha have {{followed}} the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha over time. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha. More recent Hispanic immigrants, concentrated in South Omaha, have struggled to earn living wages in meatpacking, adapt to a new society, and deal with discrimination.|$|E
5000|$|William Grose (sometimes spelled Gross) (1835 [...] - [...] July 27, 1898) was an African-American {{pioneer of}} Seattle. He was that city's second <b>black</b> <b>resident,</b> and the wealthiest nineteenth-century member of Seattle's black community. His former ranch on the {{outskirts}} of town, along East Madison Street, eventually became the center of Seattle's black middle class.|$|R
50|$|After the Civil War, the West End {{continued}} {{to be an important}} center of African-American culture. It {{was one of the few}} locations in the United States at the time where African Americans had a political voice. At least one <b>black</b> <b>resident</b> from the West End sat on Boston's community council during every year between 1876 and 1895.|$|R
50|$|Bohitile {{was born}} on 19 November 1955 in Windhoek. She {{attended}} school at Catholic School in the Old Location, Windhoek's <b>black</b> <b>resident's</b> suburb until the late 1950s.

Bohitile took up Home Economics on tertiary education at Tshiye College and Vista University, both in South Africa.|$|R
5|$|A race riot {{took place}} in Harlem, New York City, on August 1 and 2 of 1943, after a white police officer, James Collins, shot and wounded Robert Bandy, an African-American soldier; and rumors {{circulated}} that the soldier had been killed. The riot was chiefly directed by <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> against white-owned property in Harlem. It was one of six riots in the nation that year related to black and white tensions during World War II. The others {{took place in}} Detroit, Michigan, Beaumont, Texas, Mobile, Alabama, Los Angeles, California. In Beaumont and Mobile, the riots were white defense industry workers attacking blacks.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was born}} in Springfield, Ohio, on November 8, 1876, to Irish immigrants. Around the time of Shay's birth, Springfield was a town {{characterized}} by tense race relations. Large numbers of black settlers arrived in the city from Kentucky {{in the wake of}} the Civil War. <b>Black</b> <b>residents</b> soon outnumbered whites, and they competed for jobs with working class white citizens like Shay's parents. Schools were integrated in Springfield when Shay was nine years old. He left Springfield by 1895 to begin his career in minor league baseball.|$|E
5|$|Students {{initiated}} a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park; this {{was seen by}} the protesters to {{be an act of}} aggression aimed at the <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> of neighboring Harlem. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.|$|E
50|$|By the 1890s, Grose was Seattle's wealthiest <b>black</b> <b>resident.</b> In 1891 Grose, {{along with}} Dr. Samuel Burdett and Conrad Rideout, formed the Cornerstone Grand Lodge of the York Masons, Seattle's first black Masonic chapter. Women {{relatives}} of the black Masons formed the Queen of Sheba Court. This lodge led annual parades down Madison Street from its inception until the 1940s.|$|R

5|$|Construction of I-496 {{started in}} 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of {{downtown}} Lansing {{were built in}} the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.|$|E
5|$|The Green Book was {{published}} locally in New York, but its popularity {{was such that}} from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the United States Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities {{in most of the}} United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few <b>black</b> <b>residents.</b> It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which– unusual for the oil industry at the time– were franchised to African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E

50|$|Lopes {{was born}} in Cape Verde. He became a sailor prior to {{settling}} in Massachusetts. In 1858, about seven years after the founding of Seattle (some sources say he arrived in 1852), Lopes became the city's first <b>Black</b> <b>resident.</b> He opened a restaurant, {{and became one of}} Seattle's first barbers. In the early 1870s, Lopes eventually moved to Port Gamble, Washington in search of work during one of Seattle's frequent economic slumps.|$|R
5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E
25|$|At White Sulphur Springs in Greenbrier County a local {{resident}} donated {{land for}} a new building and the Bureau supplied $177.10 for building supplies and <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> raised {{the rest of the}} money.

Lewis Rice. The Bureau found the quality of teaching to be good but the physical structures very poor. Local school boards refused or sometimes delayed appropriating funds for new buildings. In Brook's Hollow the Bureau provided $300 and <b>black</b> <b>residents</b> $323 for a new schoolhouse.|$|E
