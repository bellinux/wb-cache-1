The document was expressed to create a ‘first fixed charge’ over all present and future <b>book</b> <b>debts.</b> It required Siebe Gorman to pay the proceeds of its <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> into a Barclays Bank account, and prohibited Siebe Gorman from creating any other charges on those <b>book</b> <b>debts,</b> or assigning the <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> to anyone else. So there was a prohibition on dealing with the <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> before collection of them.

40|$|Loan {{contracts}} with consumers are often covered by so-called residual <b>debt</b> <b>insurance</b> policies. The consumer enters into {{the insurance contract}} which is brokered by the lender and intended to ensure the repayment of the loan {{in the event of}} death, incapacity for work or unemployment together with the loan contract. The study deals with the question whether such combined loan and residual <b>debt</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts are linked within the meaning of § 358 para. 3 sentence 1 of the Germann Civil Code (BGB) (in the version valid until 12. 07. 2014) and the consequences of such a link for the legal relations of the parties involved. The first chapter provides an overview of the fundamental terms of the study with an emphasis on the explanation of the residual <b>debt</b> <b>insurance</b> contract and its various expressions which is based on twelve online loan applications with integrated residual <b>debt</b> <b>insurance</b> retrieved November 2012. The second and third chapters investigate whether the combination constitutes linked contracts or if the provisions for linked contracts are at least partly applicable to it. The fourth chapter covers various objections by the consumer under the insurance contract which he can hold against the lender according to § 359 BGB. It focuses on the ineffectiveness of the insurance contract due to overpricing which is close to usury. Chapters five and six deal with the withdrawal of the insurance and loan contract which, through the so-called withdrawal penetration (§ 358 para. 1, 2 BGB), impacts the respective other contract, and the reversal of the contracts. Finally, the seventh chapter deals with the situation in which insolvency proceedings were opened on the consumer's assets...|$|R

The clear intention of the parties was to cover all debts of whatsoever nature, including <b>book</b> <b>debts.</b> It was contended that so literal a construction of the cession would not lead to any absurdity; neither would it be contrary to the expressed intention of the parties.|$|R
40|$|AnalysisIn Agnew v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Privy Council {{decided that}} for a fixed charge to be created over a company's present and future <b>book</b> <b>debts,</b> the chargee must {{exercise}} control over both the uncollected <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> and their realised proceeds. Agnew has thus cast doubt upon the correctness of Siebe Gorman v Barclays Bank Limited, where the debenture in question did not specifically restrict the chargor's freedom {{to draw on the}} proceeds after they were paid into a designated account with the chargee. Recently, a Siebe Gorman-type debenture came under judicial scrutiny in National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited. The English High Court held that the control conferred by a Siebe Gorman-type debenture was deficient, whereas the English Court of Appeal took a completely different view. The issue of control concerning charges over <b>book</b> <b>debts</b> is therefore still unsettled.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of <b>insurance</b> <b>debts,</b> ie, unpaid premiums, and insurance subrogation, {{is an important}} issue in the insurance business. The importance of issue was confirmed by the legislature – according to the law on insurance activity, collecting of <b>insurance</b> <b>debts</b> is among <b>insurance</b> operations. To achieve the aim of <b>debt</b> collecting, <b>insurance</b> companies look for tools to improve the efficiency of proceedings. Economic information bureau and a process of <b>debt</b> securitization of <b>insurance</b> with an investment fund are good examples of the instrument to improve the efficiency. The threat of transmission of an information about a debtor to an economic information bureau makes a debtor more willing to pay a debt. The main reason is difficulty in obtaining credit when a debtor is recorded in an economic information bureau. Information about a debtor may be forwarded to an economic information bureau in cases strictly defined by law. It is not allowed to inform an economic information bureau about a debtor who doesn’t pay an insurance subrogation. The purpose of the securitization of <b>insurance</b> <b>debt</b> is to improve the cash flow of a insurance company as well as financial indicators of a insurance company...|$|R

5000|$|Because of the {{differences}} in priority of fixed charges and floating charges, security documents came to be drafted to contain as many charges expressed to be fixed charges as possible, and leave as little as possible covered by the floating charge, where it would have secondary priority to the claims of the preferential creditors.
