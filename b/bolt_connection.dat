40|$|Abstract—Bolt {{connection}} {{is one of}} the common connection methods in diesel engine. The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify the difference of considering the <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> or not in the shock response calculation. The methods applying in the study as following: first design the comparison test of welding connection and bolt connection; establish the diesel engine’s fasten component model of considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> and model without considering bolt connection; then calculate the shock response of the two kinds of model by DDAM method; and finally coupling the shock response in three direction. The above tests reach the result that: the natural frequency of model without considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> is higher than that of the model considering bolt connection; the rigid connection area will easily produce stress concentration; and the stress concentration can be effectively reduced by considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection.</b> Therefore, the study suggest that <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> should be considered in the study of shock response calculation of diesel engine frequency domain.

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a composite girder using glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), ultra high strength fiber reinforced concrete (UHF) and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bolts is illustrated. Experiments were carried out previously with steel bolts which connect the UHF blocks to the GFRP beam. Because of the corrosion of the steel bolts, the life span of the composite girder is reduced. Therefore, in this test series FRP bolts were used. Four point bending tests were conducted for a number of I-beams of same cross-sectional dimensions having epoxy bonded and FRP bolted UHF blocks at the top flange. In order to check the performance of the FRP bolt connections between FRP beam and UHF blocks, different bolt diameters and bolt spacing were considered. Behavior of the strain variation of top flange was compared in order to check the utilization of the ultimate tensile strain of GFRP. In fact, the experiment results show that the failure load of the composite I-beam has reduced compared to similar steel <b>bolt</b> <b>connection.</b> However, failure load similar to steel <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> can be achieved with many FRP bolts.

40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements was established to investigate the bearing failure of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> under shear. It was demonstrated (Chung and Ip.

Furthermore, it was shown (Chung and Ip. Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Steel Structures, Praha, May 1999, p. 503 - 506) that stress-strain curves, contact stiffnesses and frictional coefficients between element interfaces, and clamping forces developed in bolt shanks were important parameters for accurate prediction of the deformation characteristics of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections.</b> This paper presents an extension of the finite element investigation onto the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>connections,</b> and three distinctive failure modes (Ip and Chung. Proceeding of the Second International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, Hong Kong, December 1999) as observed in lap shear tests are successfully modelled: bearing failure; shear-out failure; and net-section failure. Furthermore, a parametric study on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> with different configurations is performed to provide bearing resistances for practical design, and the results of the {{finite element model}}ling are also compared with four codified design rules. It is found that the design rules are not applicable for <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> with high strength steels due to reduced ductility. Consequently, a semiempirical design formula for bearing resistance of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> is proposed after calibrating against finite element results.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel at elevated temperatures and post-fire condition {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel are mainly based on those of carbon steel, and are applicable for room (ambient) temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperatures. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel structures at elevated temperatures. The key {{findings of the investigation}} are described in the following paragraphs. A total of 25 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of three different grades of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The stainless steels are austenitic stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1. 4571 (AISI 316 Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1. 4162 (AISI S 32101). Totally 434 tests on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of stainless steel were performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the nominal strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European codes for stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the material properties at elevated temperatures were used in the design equations for room temperature. It is shown that the nominal strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A total of 78 cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were tested in post-fire condition. The test results were compared with those tested at room temperature. Generally, it is found that the <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> strengths in post-fire condition cooling down from 350 and 650 ºC are higher than those tested at room temperature for all three grades of stainless steel. Finite element models for single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results. Static analysis technique was used in the numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 450 specimens were performed using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing resistances of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing resistances of cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were proposed based on both the experimental and numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC. The bearing resistances of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> obtained from the tests and the finite element analyses were compared with the nominal strengths calculated using the current design rules and also compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing resistances of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis.

Many investigators have studied the strength of mechanically bolted joints in composite structures but there is less in sandwich structures. It is performed on a fully composite airplane at the connection area of the wing to the fuselage and the landing gear. The area around the joint is surrounded by the laminates from glass layers (solid laminate) and its thickness is equal to whole thickness of sandwich panel. Different states of connection between the solid laminates, where the <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> is imbedded are studied. Also, the foam core around the connection is studied and the dependence {{of the magnitude of}} damage on various parameters like the connection angle, size, and the general shape of the solid laminate on buckling is evaluated. For considering the bolted joint performance, a three dimensional finite element model has been developed by ANSYS commercial code.

40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} has quickly become the preferred method for the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{as well as}} many other DOT’s across the United States. This type of construction requires the use of full depth precast panels for the construction of the bridge deck. The segmented deck panels produce transverse joints between panels and have {{come to be known as}} the weakest portion of the deck. Cracking often occurs at these joints and is reflected through the deck overlay where water accesses and begins corrosion of the reinforcement and superstructure below. For this reason post-tensioning of the deck panels is becoming a regular practice to ensure that the deck behaves more monolithically, limiting cracking. The current post-tensioning used by UDOT inhibits future replacement of single deck panels and requires that all panels be replaced once one panel is deemed defective. The new curved <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> provides the necessary compressive stresses across the transverse joints but makes future replacement of a single deck panel possible without replacing the entire bridge deck. To better understand the behavior of the new curved <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> under loadings, laboratory testing was undertaken on both the curved bolt and the current post-tensioning used by UDOT. The testing specimens included full-scale, full-depth, precast panels that were connected using both system. The testing induced typical stresses on the panels and connections, subjecting them to negative bending and shear. The overall performance of the curved bolt proved satisfactory. The moment capacity of both connections surpassed all theoretical calculations. The yield and plastic moments were 17 % and 16 % lower, respectively, than the UDOT post-tension system while at those moments deflection was relatively the same. Due to the anchorage location of the curved bolts, the reinforcement around the transverse joint received up to 5 times the strain of that of the post-tension connections. Although both systems performed well when subjected to shear forces and as compared to the theoretical capacities, the post-tension connection greatly surpassed the curved bolt in shear capacity...|$|E
