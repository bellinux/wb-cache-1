5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Forbes {{formed a}} laager (improvised fort) about [...] from the {{southern}} bank. There, he interrogated a captive Matabele, {{the son of an}} inDuna (tribal leader), who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone, and was ill (the exact ailment was not known for sure, the prisoner said, but was suspected to be gout). The inDunas son said that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3,000 warriors, about half of whom were armed with Martini-Henry rifles. They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army, and largely demoralised, but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula's capture. Most prominent were the Imbezu, Ingubo and Insukameni Regiments; the Imbezu, Lobengula's favourite, was generally considered the strongest. After three weeks in pursuit of the king, Forbes's rations were running perilously short. He therefore resolved to attack the next day (4 December), hoping to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall.|$|E

The team had 10 returning offensive starters and 5 returning defensive starters. [...] Although to some Forcier was a foregone conclusion as the starting quarterback, the battle between him, incumbent Nick Sheridan, and Denard Robinson was anticipated to be the most competitive position battle in the Big Ten Conference according to College Football News.

[...] The team also employed a new defensive coordinator, Greg Robinson, to help guide this defensive turnaround.

500|$|The Ekaterina II-class battleships were {{intended}} to support an amphibious assault on the Bosphorus and to oppose any attempt of the British Mediterranean Fleet to force the Bosphorus and enter the Black Sea. This meant {{that they would have}} to engage Turkish coastal artillery batteries and warships in the narrow confines of the Turkish Straits. This put a premium on forward-facing guns because ships might not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to bring their broadsides to bear on the enemy. Three gun mounts, two forward and one in the rear, were settled up on relatively early in the design process, but the number of guns and the choice between turrets or barbettes was the subject of much debate. The Russians had been impressed by the performance of the barbette-mounted disappearing guns of [...] during the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 and began to seriously consider the use of this type of installation in their new battleships. The lighter weight of barbettes versus turrets allowed for the addition of several [...] guns, but it was later realized that they could be deleted in exchange for twin gun mounts in the barbettes for very little cost in weight.|$|E

2500|$|Sometime {{from the}} late 1950s to the early 1960s, Dutch {{immigrant}} and engineer Hubertus Johannes Van der Kolk built a circular house at {{the northern end of}} Mount Barker, beside Albany Highway. This unique structure, which could be rotated through 180 degrees to exploit seasonal changes, was labelled [...] "The Round House". Though the home has fallen into disrepair, it was heritage listed in 2005 and Heritage Minister Francis Logan said [...] "It was an energy-efficient concept ahead of its time."

2500|$|Following {{the costly}} but tactically {{inconclusive}} Battle of Stones River (December 31, 1862 [...] January 2, 1863) between Rosecrans and Bragg at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Bragg withdrew his army about 30 {{miles to the}} south, along the Duck River and behind the ridge known as the Highland Rim, which encircles the Nashville Basin. Small groups of pickets protected the passes through the Highland Rim and cavalry protected each flank, a front of almost 70 miles. Bragg, headquartered in Tullahoma, was concerned that Rosecrans would advance to seize the strategic city of Chattanooga, a vital rail junction and the gateway to northern Georgia. His cavalry was spread over such a wide front because he was also concerned at a tactical level that Rosecrans might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his position, forcing him to retreat or to fight at a disadvantage. Bragg assumed that any attack would be made against his left flank through the easy-to-cross Guy's Gap {{in the direction of}} Shelbyville, so he placed his larger infantry corps commanded by Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk in strong entrenchments at Shelbyville. Eight miles to his right, the corps of Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee was fortified in Wartrace, protecting the main road to Chattanooga and positioned to reinforce the other three passes through the Highland Rim(from west to east) Bell Buckle Gap, Liberty Gap, and Hoover's Gap. [...] Hoover's Gap was almost undefended; it was a four-mile-long pass between the 1100-foot ridges separating the Stones and Duck Rivers. The pass was so narrow that two wagons could barely pass side by side and was commanded by the surrounding ridges. Strong entrenchments were constructed, but they were manned by only a single cavalry regiment. After the campaign, Bragg was criticized for the inadequate nature of his Tullahoma position. Hardee told him that it was subject to both frontal and flanking attacks.|$|E
2500|$|The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Sudbury, Ontario used 1,000 tonnes {{of heavy}} water {{on loan from}} Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. The {{neutrino}} detector is [...] underground in a mine, to shield it from muons produced by cosmic rays. SNO was built {{to answer the question}} of whether or not electron-type neutrinos produced by fusion in the Sun (the only type the Sun should be producing directly, according to theory) might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> into other types of neutrinos on the way to Earth. SNO detects the Cherenkov radiation in the water from high-energy electrons produced from electron-type neutrinos as they undergo charged current (CC) interactions with neutrons in deuterium, turning them into protons and electrons (however, only the electrons are fast enough to produce Cherenkov radiation for detection). SNO also detects neutrino‚Üîelectron scattering (ES) events, where the neutrino transfers energy to the electron, which then proceeds to generate Cherenkov radiation distinguishable from that produced by CC events. The first of these two reactions is produced only by electron-type neutrinos, while the second can be caused by all of the neutrino flavors. The use of deuterium is critical to the SNO function, because all three [...] "flavours" [...] (types) of neutrinos may be detected in a third type of reaction as well, neutrino-disintegration, in which a neutrino of any type (electron, muon, or tau) scatters from a deuterium nucleus (deuteron), transferring enough energy to break up the loosely bound deuteron into a free neutron and proton via a neutral current (NC) interaction. This event is detected when the free neutron is absorbed by 35Cl‚àí present from NaCl deliberately dissolved in the heavy water, causing emission of characteristic capture gamma rays. Thus, in this experiment, heavy water not only provides the transparent medium necessary to produce and visualize Cherenkov radiation, but it also provides deuterium to detect exotic mu type (Œº) and tau (œÑ) neutrinos, as well as a non-absorbent moderator medium to preserve free neutrons from this reaction, until they can be absorbed by an easily detected neutron-activated isotope.|$|E
