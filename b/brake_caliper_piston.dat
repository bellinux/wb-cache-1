50|$|Brake fluids must {{maintain}} {{a low level}} of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> <b>piston</b> force.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> <b>pistons</b> {{then apply}} {{force to the}} brake pads, pushing them against the {{spinning}} rotor, and the friction between the pads and the rotor causes a braking torque to be generated, slowing the vehicle. Heat generated by this friction is either dissipated through vents and channels in the rotor or is conducted through the pads, which are made of specialized heat-tolerant materials such as kevlar or sintered glass.|$|R
50|$|The VFR800 has a novel DCBS linked braking system. This {{system is}} a {{departure}} from traditional motorcycle braking system where front and rear braking are independent of each other. In this system, the front brake lever applies pressure to four (or later, five) of the six front <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> <b>pistons.</b> The rotational movement of the left caliper when engaged actuates a secondary master cylinder and applies pressure {{to one of the}} rear <b>caliper's</b> <b>pistons.</b> The rear <b>brake</b> pedal is directly attached to the remaining pistons (two in the rear, and one (or two) in the front).|$|R
50|$|Jim Richards won {{the first}} two Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) events at Winton in 1985 and 1986. The 1985 event marked {{the only time in}} the history of the ATCC that a Holden did not compete in the race. Richards won the race by a lap over his {{teammate}} Neville Crichton, both in BMW 635CSis, while Kevin Bartlett finished third in a Mitsubishi Starion. Richards' 1986 win came only after the Nissan Skyline of Gary Scott was excluded for using oversized front <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> <b>pistons.</b>|$|R

5000|$|While {{energy is}} always lost during a brake event, a {{secondary}} factor that influences efficiency is [...] "off-brake drag", or drag {{that occurs when}} the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a braking event, hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> <b>pistons</b> to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the brake system will drag until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the rubbing surface. During this time, there can be significant brake drag. This brake drag can lead to significant parasitic power loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.|$|R

40|$|For {{last several}} decades {{aluminium}} and aluminium alloys are widely used in automotive industries because for their favorable properties like low density, good malleability, high formability, high corrosion resistance and high electrical and thermal conductivity. High machinability and workability of aluminium alloys are prone to porosity due to gases dissolved during melting processes. However, in the engineering application pure aluminium and its alloys still have some problems such has relatively low strength, unstable mechanical properties and low wear resistance. AC 2 A alloy posseâ€™s better mechanical properties, machinability, wear resistance and are suitable for heat treatment. Now it is used for automobile application like <b>brake</b> <b>calipers,</b> <b>piston</b> rods etc. The microstructure can be modified and mechanical properties can be improved by alloying and heat treatment. In this regards, the present paper reports the presence of magnesium on the mechanical properties and microstructure of AC 2 A Aluminium Alloy...|$|R
5000|$|The CC8S uses {{magnesium}} alloy wheels with center-locking hubs, to which 225/40ZR 18" [...] front and 335/40ZR 20" [...] rear Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires are mounted. The discs are cross-drilled for increased ventilation, and measure 340 mm {{at the front}} and 315 mm at the rear. The <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> contain 6 <b>pistons</b> in front and 4 pistons at the rear. The brakes are power-assisted by the Koenigsegg Advanced Control System.|$|R
50|$|The {{disk brake}} {{requires}} a flat circular brake disk and plurality of <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> with hydraulic <b>pistons</b> and brake pads http://svendborg-brakes.dk/uk/products/brakes/active_brakes.html. The hydraulic yaw brakes {{are able to}} fix the nacelle in position thus relieving the yaw drives from that task. The cost however of the yaw brake {{in combination with the}} requirement of a hydraulic installation (pump, valves, pistons) and its installation in the vicinity of brake pads sensitive to lubricant contamination is often an issue.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>caliper</b> {{assembly}} usually {{consisting of}} one or two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel <b>pistons</b> (called <b>caliper</b> <b>pistons),</b> a set of thermally conductive brake pads and a rotor (also called a brake disc) or drum attached to an axle.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{the front}} <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> were changed to Brembo Monobloc 4 pad <b>calipers</b> - each <b>piston</b> having a {{separate}} pad gave {{an increase in}} braking performance and feel.|$|R
50|$|Often used in disc <b>brakes,</b> the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> {{assembly}} {{consists of}} one to two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel <b>pistons</b> (<b>caliper</b> <b>pistons).</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>calipers</b> {{are one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop.The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together.|$|R
50|$|The car is {{equipped}} with Brembo <b>brake</b> <b>calipers,</b> rotors and pads. The <b>calipers</b> have four <b>pistons</b> in front and four in the rear. The rotors are drilled carbon ceramic, 380 mm in diameter and 34 mm thick.|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} W204 C-Class has four trim and {{equipment}} levels: Classic, Elegance, Avantgarde, and AMG. The Classic is the base trim found {{only on the}} smaller four-cylinder engine models and includes Brighton cloth seats with ARTICO leather (vinyl) as an option. The Elegance has ARTICO leather upholstery as standard with real leather as an option. The Avantgarde has Liverpool fabric/ARTICO leather seats with real leather as an option. The Classic and Elegance lines retain the traditional Mercedes-Benz radiator grille, with a vertical three-point star hood emblem, and are designed to appeal to traditional luxury car buyers. The Avantgarde and AMG have a similar grille to the Mercedes sport coupe, with three horizontal bars and a large centre-mounted star. These models have additional equipment including a three-spoke steering wheel, AMG bodykit, lower and stiffer sport suspension, upgraded <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> <b>calipers,</b> and larger alloy wheels. They are designed to position the C-Class in the sports sedan sector. Unlike previous generations of the C-Class, and other contemporary Mercedes sedans which stayed with the traditional grille and hood ornament, the W204's advertising predominantly features the sport grille and AMG bodykit, especially in Canada and the United States.|$|R

To analyse caliper behaviour, complex Finite Element models were created and successfully validated {{using a variety of}} experimental techniques, including exceptionally suitable Digital Image Correlation. A novel methodology to optimise caliper design was developed, using non-linear contact Finite Element Analysis and topology optimisation, to generate lightweight, high performance <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b> The method was used on a Formula 1 brake assembly and significant improvement in structural design was achieved, with the new caliper being lighter and stiffer than the original. The same approach was used on more conventional 4 <b>pistons</b> <b>calipers</b> using various boundary conditions with particular focus on mass reduction and considerably lighter designs were achieved.
