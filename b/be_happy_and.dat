5|$|To {{help her}} escape this awkward {{domestic}} situation, Harriet's maternal aunt Henrietta arranged for her niece {{to marry her}} lover of seventeen years, Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville. The couple's marriage proved to <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> <b>and</b> it produced five children. Granville served as his country's ambassador to France intermittently from 1824 to 1841, and he was awarded an earldom in 1833. With her position, Harriet acted as hostess to Parisian society, writing detailed accounts that were later published. She died in 1862 of a stroke, having been widowed fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E

5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E
5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E

Little bundles are made with it, and hung on fruit trees to make their fruit better. A bigger bundle may be stored in a dry place: it will be burned on St. George's Day, as a {{protection}} of fields against hail. Another bundle is taken away across the nearest stream – a symbolic elimination of all the vermin that may be present in the house. Men make crosses from the remnant of the thicker side of badnjak, and stick them under eaves, on fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries.

25|$|Genie is a ward of {{the state}} of California, and is living in an {{undisclosed}} location in Los Angeles. In May 2008, ABC News reported that someone who spoke to them under condition of anonymity had hired a private investigator who located Genie in 2000. According to the investigator she was living a simple lifestyle in a small private facility for mentally underdeveloped adults and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> <b>and</b> she only spoke a few words but could still communicate fairly well in sign language. The news stories also reported that Genie's mother died of unspecified natural causes at the age of 87 and featured an interview with Genie's brother, who was living in Ohio, which was the only time he publicly spoke about his or Genie's lives; he told reporters that since leaving the Los Angeles area he had visited Genie and their mother only once, in 1982, and had refused to watch or read anything about Genie's life until just prior to the interview, but said he had recently heard Genie was doing well. A story by journalist Rory Carroll in The Guardian, published in July 2016, stated that Genie still lived in state care and that her brother died in 2011, and said that despite repeated efforts Susan Curtiss had been unable to renew contact with Genie.|$|E
