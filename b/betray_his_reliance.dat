His 1963 work takes a scientific atheist view of the subject, but <b>betrays</b> <b>his</b> <b>reliance</b> on missionaries as he relates Muslim terms to their Christian equivalents.

His 1963 work takes a scientific atheist view of the subject, but <b>betrays</b> <b>his</b> <b>reliance</b> on missionaries as he relates Muslim terms to their Christian equivalents. For example, he describes the Mahdi as [...] "the Messiah in Islam", and discusses [...] "Muslim Clergy" [...] and a [...] "Muslim Church", all concepts that Russian scholars of Islam in the 19th century had understood to be inaccurate.He observed that religion is more about how people {{relate to each other}} in relation to religious beliefs, than about the nature of these beliefs.Tokarev's view that religions are more than a theology, and comprise a social force affecting many aspects of people's lives, was controversial among Soviet scholars of religion. He challenged the prevalent negative view at the time, which perceived Islam as a potential tool for the bourgeoisie and reactionaries, and not one {{that could be used to}} solve the problems of the masses. He showed that Islam could be used effectively by politicians with secular goals, and that Islamic socialism could be a positive force in the development of contemporary Muslim states.|$|R
