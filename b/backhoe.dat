5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} <b>backhoe</b> that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.|$|E
5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a <b>backhoe</b> bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the <b>backhoe</b> earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E

5|$|In May 2013, Alamogordo's City Commission {{approved}} {{a deal for}} Canada-based film production company Fuel Industries to excavate the Atari landfill site. Fuel Entertainment partnered with Xbox Entertainment Studios and Lightbox to make a documentary about the 1983 massive game burial of Atari games, said {{to be one of}} the gaming culture's greatest urban legends. On April 26, 2014, video game archaeologists began sifting through years of trash from the old Alamogordo landfill. The first batch of E.T. games was discovered after about three hours of digging, and hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a <b>backhoe.</b> In the deal between the City of Alamogordo and Fuel Entertainment regarding the excavation, Fuel Entertainment was to be given 250 games or 10 percent of what was found.|$|E
5|$|The public {{remained}} mostly {{unaware of}} mass burials {{on the site}} until the 1990s, until the Sankofa Society conducted a well-publicized blessing ceremony in 1991. Kolkana refused to sell or donate the land {{back to the city}} of West Palm Beach, but halted any plans for construction on the property. In 1992, city work crews located human remains on the property using a <b>backhoe.</b> The bones were reburied, but their locations were marked. Resident Robert Hazard established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition in 1999 as a non-profit organization used to reacquire the land and solicit donations for a memorial complex. The complex was originally intended to include an educational center and a museum about African American pioneers and migrant farm workers, at a cost of approximately $6.1million. Organizations such as the Sankofa Society proposed a less sophisticated plan of erecting an information wall and a large marble headstone, at a far less expensive cost of about $43,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} in 1982 when work began on building a road across the pond in a new housing development, Windover Farms. A <b>backhoe</b> operator noticed several skulls in the bucket of his machine. The sheriff and medical examiner determined that the burials were not recent. The local forensic expert originally believed he was examining modern Caucasian remains. The developers, Jack Eckerd and Jim Swann, halted construction at the pond and called in archaeologists. Radiocarbon dating on two bones excavated from the pond by the <b>backhoe,</b> {{paid for by the}} developers, yielded dates of 7,210 years and 7,320 years Before Present, establishing the importance of the find. The developers changed their development plans in order to leave the pond intact and donated $60,000 worth of pumping equipment to drain the pond for excavation.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{extraction}} is mechanized but fairly basic: shallow open pits are dug with a <b>backhoe</b> and the {{excavated material}} is screened for its potential gem contents. The pits are further examined by hand, and commercial production is supplemented {{by individuals who}} sell their surface-picked findings to Korite and several other producers. Approximately 50% of the ammolite mined is suitable for jewelry. Korite, the largest miner of ammolite, produces over 90% of the worlds supply of ammolite.|$|E

In 1994, during rock removal operations, a <b>backhoe</b> {{operator}} accidentally {{struck a}} petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks. The operator’s mistake caused the pipeline to rupture and spill between 1,000 and 5,000 gallons of heating {{oil into the}} Skagway river.

25|$|The current {{standard}} for Malaysian number plates were originally derivatives of pre-1932 number plate formats in the United Kingdom, first issued after {{the introduction of}} motorised vehicles in the 1900s during British rule. Number plates are typically issued and are formatted similarly for any motorised vehicle that runs on rubber tyres, including most road-legal private, commercial and industrial vehicles, motorcycles, emergency vehicles, and selected heavy equipment (such as agricultural tractors, truck-mounted cranes and <b>backhoe</b> loaders). With the exception of those issued for taxis, vehicle dealers and diplomats, all vehicle number plates in Malaysia have white characters on black background for both front and rear plates, regardless of the vehicle type.|$|E
25|$|Camp Nelson National Cemetery is {{overseen by}} one {{cemetery}} director. The director and one administrative assistant {{work in the}} office, communicating with families and funeral homes to schedule funeral services and burials, coordinate with various agencies for the annual ceremonies, maintain records, and to answer questions or address concerns made by the general public. The staff includes six full-time cemetery caretakers, though the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hires temporary workers almost every summer to augment the staff by about fifty percent. These caretakers prepare graves with a <b>backhoe</b> or hand held tools (pick and shovel), take custody of and transport a casket to its grave, lower the casket into the grave, seal it within a burial vault, and fill in the grave. Caretakers also receive delivered headstones, set and align them {{at the head of}} the appropriate graves, and maintain the grounds; duties include cutting the grass, pruning trees, clearing the roads of leaves in the autumn and snow in the winter, preparing the funeral shelter for services, disposing of litter, and interacting with the public to answer questions or find graves.|$|E

25|$|The IRA's attack {{involved}} two teams. One {{team would}} drive a digger with {{a bomb in}} its bucket through the base's perimeter fence and light the fuse. At the same time, the other team would arrive in a van and open fire on the base, {{with the goal of}} killing three RUC officers as they came off duty. Both teams would then leave the area in the van. To avoid security checkpoints, the bomb was ferried by boat across Lough Neagh, from Ardboe to Maghery. The van and digger that would be used were hijacked in the hours leading up to the attack. The van, a blue Toyota HiAce, was stolen by masked men from a business in Dungannon. At about the same time, the unit's commander Jim Lynagh was spotted in the town, suggesting the van may be used in the attack. The digger (a <b>backhoe</b> loader) was taken from a farm at Lislasly Road, about two miles west of Loughgall. Two IRA members stayed at the farm to stop the owners raising the alarm. IRA member Declan Arthurs drove the digger, while two others drove ahead of him in a scout car. The rest of the unit travelled in the van from another location, presumably also with a scout car. When a covert observation post monitoring the digger reported that it was being moved, the SAS took up its positions.|$|E
500|$|Philippines: The Philippines, {{a country}} which the CITES Standing Committee noted {{as one of the}} major {{consumers}} of ivory in 2012, became the first such nation to destroy its holdings in June 2013. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the division coordinating the destruction, had planned to hold a [...] "ceremonial burning", but environmental objections to the idea of legitimated open burning led them to instead crush all five tons by first running over them with a road roller, then pounding them with the bucket of a <b>backhoe,</b> and finally taking the bits that remained to an incinerator.|$|E

Scully shares her lab results: the [...] "blood" [...] on the ceiling fan and on the dog is actually grime, as the neighborhood is built {{on top of an}} old landfill. Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard, so the next day he gets a <b>backhoe</b> to dig up the front yard, telling the neighbors he's putting in a reflecting pool, which is not against the community rules. They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.|$|E
