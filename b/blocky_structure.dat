40|$|Copolymerization of {{mixtures}} of epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) and D,L- or L-lactide has been initiated by aluminum isopropoxide. On {{the basis of}} the monomer reactivity ratios and assuming that no side reaction occurs, tapered copolymers should be formed particularly when D,L-lactide is the comonomer rather than L-lactide. The sequential distribution of the comonomers has been analyzed by an original method based on the quantitative measurement of the carbonyl C- 13 signals. Comparison of the experimental and the theoretical distributions clearly shows that transesterification reactions occur during copolymerization through both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms. Gel permeation chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry data support that conclusion. The D,L-lactide-based copolymers have however a more <b>blocky</b> <b>structure</b> than those containing L-lactide, and they are also less sensitive to transesterification reactions.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of dry masonry columns can be approximated with finite-difference equations. Continuum models follow by replacing the difference quotients of the discrete model by corresponding differential expressions. The mathematically simplest {{of these models}} is a one-dimensional Cosserat theory. Within the presented homogenization context, the Cosserat theory is obtained by making ad hoc assumptions regarding {{the relative importance of}} certain terms in the differential expansions. The quality of approximation of the various theories is tested by comparison of the dispersion relations for bending waves with the dispersion relation of the discrete theory. All theories coincide with differences of less than 1 % for wave-length-block-height (L/h) ratios bigger than 2 pi. The theory based on systematic differential approximation remains accurate up to L/h = 3 and then diverges rapidly. The Cosserat model becomes increasingly inaccurate for L/h < 2 pi. However, in contrast to the systematic approximation, the wave speed remains finite. In conclusion, considering its relative simplicity, the Cosserat model appears to be the natural starting point for the development of continuum models for <b>blocky</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

Then, the block copolymerization occurs in the bulk at 40 °C by the addition of VC. The addition of water to the polymerization medium or the slow generation of alkyl radicals during the whole polymerization is beneficial to the process by consuming part of the excess of deactivator (Co(acac) 2) that blocks the polymer chains into the dormant form.

40|$|In this work, {{modern and}} buried paleosols were sampled at the Farwell {{locality}} along the South Fork of the Big Nemaha River, southeastern Nebraska, USA. Site 1 (65 - 1) and site 2 (65 - 2) developed in Holocene alluvial deposits and are developed {{on a low}} terrace in sediments of the Late Gunder Member of the Deforest Formation. The paleosols are fine-grained and contain abundant flecks of charcoal. Soils at the third site (64 - 1) formed in Wisconsinan-age Peoria Loess that overlies alluvium of the Severance Formation. All these alluvial sites are dominantly fine-grained and oxidized, with reduced sections containing detrital organic matter near river level. Field macrophological investigations indicated that soil at site 1 has A and B horizonation, including a thick dark A and a blocky or prismatic structured B horizon. At site 2, multiple dark buried soils occurred with subangular <b>blocky</b> <b>structure</b> and charcoal fragments. At site 3, the buried soil had dark colors and subangular <b>blocky</b> <b>structure.</b> The organic carbon concentration was relatively high in the surface horizons of the two modern soils (site 1, site 3), {{as well as in}} the buried surfaces horizon of the paleosols (site 2). Organic C ranged from 3. 9 to 22. 7 g/kg, 3. 2 to 6. 5 g/kg, and from 17. 5 to 10. 07 g/kg in the whole soil profiles at site 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The stable carbon isotope data for the three sites indicated that mixed communities of C 3 and C 4 plants were predominant during the mid-Holocene period, suggesting that the climate fluctuated between colder and wetter and between warmer and drier during that period of Holocene at Farwell site. Amino-acid N concentrations decreased with the depth in both modern and buried paleosols. Subtle increases in AA-N in the A horizons of the buried paleosols may preserve a record of biological activity in those horizons when they were near the land surface. Treatment of soil samples with HF released amino acids that were trapped between interlamellar surfaces of clay minerals.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} and morphology of {{a series}} of homogeneous ethylene- 1 -octene copolymers, covering a wide range of 1 -octene content up to 44 mole%, is studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The influence of the comonomer (1 -octene) content, as well as the influence of the comonomer type (branch length) are investigated by comparison with previous results on homogeneous ethylene-propylene and ethylene-l-butene copolymers. Special emphasis is put on copolymers with high comonomer contents or low densities (< 870 kg/m(3)) at room temperature. The thermal behaviour and the morphology of the present copolymers reveal no discontinuities with increasing comonomer content and support a model in which the morphology changes gradually from a lamellar base morphology into a granular one consisting of small <b>blocky</b> <b>structures</b> and, possibly via fringed-micelles, into a morphology consisting of loosely packed ethylene sequences. The latter structures are too small and/or too imperfect to be detected by WAXD. However, SAXS and DSC are sensitive to them and are useful techniques over the whole comonomer content range.

For this purpose, a nylon salt of 1, 5 -diamino- 2 -methylpentane (Dytek A) and isophthalic acid (IPA) was used and reactions were carried out via both solid-state polymerization (SSP) of the nylon salt with PA 6 and melt copolymerization (MP) of the nylon salt with e-caprolactam for comparison. For the SSP the nylon salt was pre-mixed with the amorphous phase of PA 6 by a solution mixing process, followed by evaporation of the solvent, after which transamidation reactions were forced below the Tm of PA 6.

40|$|Observations {{indicate}} {{that over the}} past several decades, geomorphic processes in the Arctic have been changing or intensifying. Coastal erosion, which currently supplies most of the sediment and carbon to the Arctic Ocean [Rachold et al., 2000], may have doubled since 1955 [Mars and Houseknecht, 2007]. Further inland, expansion of channel networks [Toniolo et al., 2009] and increased river bank erosion [Costard et al., 2007] have been attributed to warming. Lakes, ponds, and wetlands appear to be more dynamic, growing in some areas, shrinking in others, and changing distribution across lowland regions [e. g., Smith et al., 2005]. On the Arctic coastal plain, recent degradation of frozen ground previously stable for thousands of years suggests 10 – 30 % of lowland and tundra landscapes may be affected by even modest warming [Jorgenson et al., 2006]. In headwater regions, hillslope soil erosion and landslides are increasing [e. g., Gooseff et al., 2009]. These changes result from a system- wide response to changing climate [Hinzman et al., 2005] arising from a region- wide warming and thawing of permafrost (Figure 1). Permafrost is ground that has existed at temperatures below freezing for at least 2 years. Within permafrost lie all forms of ground ice (ice in pores, cavities, and voids, or other openings in soil or rock) as well as massive ice (ice formed as lenses, layers, wedges, and <b>blocky</b> <b>structures).</b> Massive ice leaves large unstable voids in soils when it melts. Although some level of landscape change is expected in response to natural climate variability, the scale and rapidity of recently observed changes suggest that Arctic landscapes may be particularly sensitive to climate change and capable of rapid geomorphic responses to perturbations.

40|$|This thesis was {{concerned}} primarily with the synthesis and the ring-opening polymerisation of anhydrosulfites (1, 3, 2 -dioxa-thiolan- 4 -one- 2 -oxides), and secondly with the copolymerisation of anhydrosulfites with -caprolactone. The polyesters and copolyesters synthesised are of considerable interest in medical applications {{and also for}} use as environmental friendly packaging. A range of anhydrosulfites were prepared according to an established method. Aliphatic anhydrosulfites were obtained {{with a level of}} purity satisfactory for polymerisation whereas aromatic anhydrosulfites decomposed during distillation and purification by chromatographic techniques. Aliphatic anhydrosulfites with a substituent, such as methyl, isopropyl, n-butyl and isobutyl were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Analysis of these spectra revealed that the five-membered anhydrosulfite ring was puckered and that when the substituent was bulky, rotations about the alkyl chains were restricted. A wide range of anionic initiators may be used to initiate anhydrosulfites. Lithium alkyls {{turned out to be more}} successful than alkali metal alkoxides and amides. The molecular weights were found to depend on the basicity of the initiator, the monomer-to-initiator ratio, the nature of the solvent and the polymerisation temperature. The molecular weight M 0 of poly(L-lactic acid) ranged from (0. 5 to 6) x 104. Highly crystalline and purely isotactic poly(lactic acid) was synthesised from L-lactic acid anhydrosulfite (L-LAAS) whereas DL-LAAS led to an amorphous polymer with randomly distributed D-and L-lactic units. This indicated that this polymerisation was not stereoselective. However, the bulkiness of the substituent in the anhydrosulfites molecule was found to influence the stereoselectivity of the polymerisation, thus polyesters with isobutyl or n-butyl pendant group were preferentially isotactic. Block-copolymers of ε-caprolactone and several anhydrosulfites were successfully produced. Block-copolymers of LAAS with ε-caprolactone were also synthesised, but the incorporation of caprolactone units was rather small. In contrast, random copolymerisation of LAAS and ε-caprolactone led to polymers with <b>blocky</b> <b>structures</b> similar to those obtained in the block-copolymerisation of LAAS with  ε-caprolactone...|$|R
