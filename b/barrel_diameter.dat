25|$|Little League International has a {{different}} standard for composite bat allowance in its leagues. Composite bats must meet an accelerated break standard set by the USA Baseball organization and be stamped with an official USA Baseball logo. Other bat dimensions are akin to wood and aluminum alloy requirements (length, <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter,</b> etc.).|$|E
25|$|To be {{suitable}} for play in BBCOR leagues (NCAA, NFHS, etc.), for example, composite bats must meet certain requirements. Many of these requirements {{are the same as}} their aluminum or wood counterparts. For example, the bat's weight to length ratio, known as the drop (length in inches - weight in ounces), must equal negative three. Meaning, a bat with a 33-inch length must weigh 30 ounces. Further, no bat's <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter,</b> at any point, can be greater than 2 5/8 inches. For composite bats there is added scrutiny. Specifically, the rebound rate or trampoline effect, after an accelerated break in period, must stay under certain requirements.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{technology}} existed, it remained for British designers {{to develop a}} system that could deliver hollow-charge ammunition in a larger size and with a greater range than that possessed by the No. 68. At {{the same time that}} Mohaupt was developing hollow-charge ammunition, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker of the Royal Artillery was investigating the possibility of developing a lightweight platoon mortar. However, rather than using the conventional system of firing the mortar shell from a barrel fixed to a baseplate, Blacker wanted to use the spigot mortar system. Instead of a barrel, there was a steel rod known as a 'spigot' fixed to a baseplate, and the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot, which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air. By effectively putting the barrel {{on the inside of the}} weapon, the <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter</b> was no longer a limitation on the warhead size. Blacker eventually designed a lightweight mortar that he named the 'Arbalest' and submitted it to the War Office, but it was turned down in favour of a Spanish design. Undeterred, however, Blacker continued with his experiments and decided to try to invent a hand-held anti-tank weapon based on the spigot design, but found that the spigot could not generate sufficient velocity needed to penetrate armour. But he did not abandon the design, and eventually come up with the Blacker Bombard, a swivelling spigot-style system that could launch a [...] bomb approximately although the bombs it fired could not actually penetrate armour, they could still severely damage tanks, and in 1940 a large number of Blacker Bombards were issued to the Home Guard as anti-tank weapons.|$|E

2500|$|Due to Halo being a first-person shooter, {{significant}} {{emphasis was}} put into the design of human weaponry. The chief designer for human weapons was Robt McLees, {{who at the time}} of Combat Evolveds development was the only staff member at Bungie with knowledge of firearms; McLees {{wanted to make sure that}} the weapons looked [...] "cool", but were also grounded by real-world physics and considerations. The game designers also [...] wanted items that would be recognizable to players, yet futuristic-looking enough to plausibly exist in Halos 2552. In an interview, McLees noted that after human weapons had been vetted and the rough design worked out, [...] "I went ahead and built the highest-res LOD (level of detail) – and this is where I get [...] "bogged down" [...] with all of the stuff that [...] "nobody cares about" [...] like correct <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter,</b> placement of safeties, sights, magazine release buttons, and making sure that the magazines are actually large enough to hold all the bullets they're supposed to, that they would feed correctly and that the casings eject out of the correct side of the gun." [...] Occasionally, technical restraints forced design changes; the submachine gun introduced in Halo 2 originally featured a transparent magazine which allowed players to see the caseless ammo feed into the gun, but it proved too ambitious given the time and hardware available.|$|E
5000|$|Barrel Diameter: mating {{fasteners}} {{often are}} going through pre-drilled holes. The <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter</b> should be slightly less than the installation hole.|$|E
50|$|A further {{problem is}} that, if the warhead is {{contained}} inside the <b>barrel,</b> its <b>diameter</b> becomes overly restricted by {{the caliber of}} that barrel. In non-gun applications, when HEAT warheads are delivered with missiles, rockets, bombs, grenades, or spigot mortars, the warhead size {{is no longer a}} limiting factor. In these cases, HEAT warheads often seem oversized in relation to the round's body. Classic examples of this include the German Panzerfaust and Soviet RPG-7.|$|R

40|$|Oxygen (O 2) {{concentration}} {{inside the}} substrate {{is an important}} measurement for silage-research and-practical management. In the laboratory gas chromatography is commonly employed for O 2 measurement. Among sensor-based techniques, accurate and reliable in situ measurement is rare because of high levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2) generated {{by the introduction of}} O 2 in the silage. The presented study focused on assessing three types of commercial O 2 sensors, including Clark oxygen electrodes (COE), galvanic oxygen cell (GOC) sensors and the Dräger chip measurement system (DCMS). Laboratory cross calibration of O 2 versus CO 2 (each 0 – 15 vol. %) was made for the COE and the GOC sensors. All calibration results verified that O 2 measurements for both sensors were insensitive to CO 2. For the O 2 in situ measurement in silage, all O 2 sensors were first tested in two sealed <b>barrels</b> (<b>diameter</b> 35. 7 cm; height: 60 cm) to monitor the O 2 depletion with respect to the ensiling process (Test-A). The second test (Test-B) simulated the silage unloading process by recording the O 2 penetration dynamics in three additional barrels, two covered by dry ice (0. 6 kg or 1. 2 kg of each) on the top surface and one without. Based on a general comparison of the experimental data, we conclude that each of these in situ sensor monitoring techniques for O 2 concentration in silage exhibit individual advantages and limitations...|$|R

50|$|Higher {{efficiency}} can {{be achieved}} in longer barrel firearms because they have better volume ratio. However, the efficiency gain is less than corresponding to the volume ratio, because the expansion is not truly adiabatic and burnt gas becomes cold faster because of exchange of heat with the barrel. Large firearms (such as cannons) achieve smaller barrel-heating loss because they have better volume-to-surface ratio.High <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter</b> is also helpful because lower barrel friction is induced by sealing compared to the accelerating force. The force {{is proportional to the}} square of the <b>barrel</b> <b>diameter</b> while sealing needs are proportional to the perimeter by the same pressure.|$|E

5000|$|In guns, {{particularly}} firearms, caliber or calibre is {{the approximate}} internal {{diameter of the}} barrel, or {{the diameter of the}} projectile it fires, in hundredths or sometimes thousandths of an inch.

40|$|Somatosensory {{thalamus}} and cortex in rodents contain topological {{representations of}} the facial whisker pad. The thalamic representation of a single whisker ("barreloid") is presumed to project exclusively to the cortical representation ("barrel") of the same whisker; however, it was not known when this correspondence is established during early development, nor how precise the thalamocortical projection is at birth, before formation of barrels and barreloids. To answer these questions, we retrogradely labeled thalamocortical projection neurons in fixed brain slices from 0 - 8 d old (P 0 -P 8) mice, by placing paired deposits of two fluorescent dyes in adjacent barrels or (before barrel formation) in adjacent loci in upper cortical layers. At all ages studied, a negligible fraction of the retrogradely labeled cells was double labeled, implying that branches of single thalamocortical axons never extended within layer IV over an area wider than a single barrel. In P 0 preparations, 70 % of paired dye deposits placed 75 - 200 microns apart resulted in statistically significant segregation of labeled cell clusters in the thalamus. Quantitative analysis indicated that on P 0 about 70 % of thalamocortical axons were within 1. 3 presumptive <b>barrel</b> <b>diameters</b> from their topologically precise target. In P 4 -P 8 preparations, {{the great majority of}} thalamic cells retrogradely labeled from a single barrel were found in a single barreloid, implying a 1 : 1 projection of barreloids to barrels. The postnatal increase in topological precision was reproduced by a computer simulation, which assumed that many aberrant axons corrected their initial targeting error by extending terminal arborizations asymmetrically, towards the center of their appropriate barrel...|$|R
