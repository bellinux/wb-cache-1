25|$|The dental series th, nh, lh {{are always}} laminal (that is, {{pronounced}} by touching with {{the surface of}} the tongue just above the tip, called the blade of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are interdental with the tip of the tongue visible between the teeth, as in th in English; dental with the tip of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the blade is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar, that is, with both the tip and the <b>blade</b> <b>making</b> contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French t, d, n, l. The first tends to be used in careful enunciation, and the last in more rapid speech, while the tongue-down articulation is less common.|$|E
25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round <b>blade,</b> <b>making</b> it easy to cut a smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of}} the ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E

50|$|Variable Geometry Turbomachine {{technology}} {{is used in}} turbocharger of diesel engines, where the turbo has variable vanes which control the flow of exhaust onto the turbine blades. A Variable Geometry Turbocharger has movable vanes which direct the flow of exhaust onto the turbine blades. Actuators are used to adjust the vane angles. Agle of vanes vary hroughout the range of RPM to optimize turbine behaviour. At high engine speed vanes are fully open and the exhaust is fully directed onto the turbine blades. At low engine speeds vanes are almost closed creating a narrow passage for the exhaust. This accelerates the exhaust towards the turbine <b>blades,</b> <b>making</b> them spin faster.|$|R

5000|$|A {{rotary cutter}} {{is a tool}} {{generally}} used by quilters to cut fabric. It consists of a handle with a circular blade that rotates, thus the tool's name. Rotary cutter blades are very sharp, can be resharpened, and are available in different sizes: usually smaller blades are used to cut small curves, while larger blades are used to cut to straight lines and broad curves. Several layers of fabric can be cut simultaneously with a sharp (fresh) <b>blade,</b> <b>making</b> it easier to cut out patchwork pieces of the same shape and size than with scissors. Quilters use rotary cutters with specially designed templates and rulers made of approximately 1/8-inch thick clear or color-tinted plastic.|$|E

25|$|This further {{advanced}} {{model of the}} engine, {{intended to be a}} fully supersonic version of the aircraft, was partially achieved by the incorporation of a reheat jetpipe - also known as an afterburner. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine <b>blades,</b> <b>making</b> use of unused oxygen present in the exhaust. To supply more air to the afterburner than could move through the fairly small engine, an augmentor fan powered by the engine was to be fitted behind the engine to draw air around the engine via ducts. These changes were estimated to provide for an addition 1,620lb of thrust when at 36,000ft and 500mph; much greater thrust gains were believed to have resulted from travelling at speeds in excess of 500mph.|$|R

40|$|Wind {{power is}} a {{renewable}} energy source that is today the fastest growing solution to reduce CO 2 emissions in the electric energy mix. Upwind {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} with three blades has been the preferred technical choice for more than two decades. This horizontal axis concept is today widely leading the market. The current PhD thesis will cover an alternative type of wind turbine with straight blades and rotating along the vertical axis. A brief overview of the main differences between the horizontal and vertical axis concept has been made. However the main focus of this thesis is the aerodynamics of the wind turbine <b>blades.</b> <b>Making</b> aerodynamically efficient turbines starts with efficient <b>blades.</b> <b>Making</b> efficient <b>blades</b> requires a good understanding of the physical phenomena and effective simulations tools to model them. The specific aerodynamics for straight bladed vertical axis turbine flow are reviewed together with the standard aerodynamic simulations tools that have been used in the past by blade and rotor designer. A reasonably fast (regarding computer power) and accurate (regarding comparison with experimental results) simulation method was still lacking in the field prior to the current work. This thesis aims at designing such a method. Analytical methods can be used to model complex flow if the geometry is simple. Therefore, a conformal mapping method is derived to transform any set of section into a set of standard circles. Then analytical procedures are generalized to simulate moving multibody sections in the complex vertical flows and forces experienced by the blades. Finally the fast semi analytical aerodynamic algorithm boosted by fast multipole methods to handle high number of vortices is coupled with a simple structural model of the rotor to investigate potential aeroelastic instabilities. Together with these advanced simulation tools, a standard double multiple streamtube model has been developed and used to design several straight bladed rotor ranging from 2 kW to 20 kW.

40|$|At the Division of Electricity at Uppsala University, a {{wind power}} concept has been developed. The concept uses a {{vertical}} axis wind turbine with a direct driven generator. The turbine has fixed <b>blades,</b> <b>making</b> speed control {{the only way}} to regulate power absorption. The speed is controlled with the electric load. The turbine is not self-starting, but can be started using the generator as a motor. In this project, an unsupervised electric system with automatic control is designed and constructed. The starting point is a detailed study of the earlier developed control system. To be able to select the rating of the components, theoretical calculations are done. Simulations in MATLAB are performed to predict the behavior of the system. The resulting system is a working prototype in operation outside of Uppsala. The system starts the turbine using a new start-up strategy. Loading of the generator is controlled by primarily supplying a regular consumer with direct current and secondly dissipating additional power as heat. A circuit stopping the turbine, in case of different failures, is included in the system...|$|R
