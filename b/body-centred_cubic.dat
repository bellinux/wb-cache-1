40|$|Group theoretic {{means are}} {{employed}} to analyse the Hopf bifurcation on pattern forming systems with the periodicity of the face-centred (FCC) and <b>body-centred</b> (BCC) <b>cubic</b> lattices. We find all C-axial subgroups {{of the normal}} form symmetry group by first extending the symmetry to a larger group. There are 15 such solutions for the FCC lattice, of which at least 12 can be stable for appropriate parameter values. In addition, a number of subaxial solutions can bifurcate directly from the trivial solution, and quasiperiodic solutions can also exist. We find 33 C-axial solutions for the BCC lattice and their stability criteria. We discuss applications of the method of symmetry enlargement to other systems. A model-independent approach is taken throughout, {{and the results are}} applicable {{to a wide variety of}} pattern forming systems.

40|$|The present {{work has}} the aim {{to study the}} effect of the {{diffusion}} of Ni and Ni-B on the microstructure and the hardness of Ti Cp. Ni and NiB were deposited on the titanium by electrolytic and electroless deposition, respectively. The treatments of diffusion were carried out at temperatures below and above the titanium β-transus temperature in order to examine {{the effect of the}} two different phases on diffusion behaviour and the final microstructure. The samples, after holding at the temperature of diffusion for 1 h, were cooled in furnace at 5 °C/min. The resulting microstructure was investigated by optical microscope (OM), SEM-EDS, glow discharge optical spectrometer (GDOS), XRD and micro-hardness test. Better results were obtained at temperature above the β-transus, which {{can be attributed to the}} increase of diffusion due, both, to the high temperature and the <b>cubic</b> <b>body-centred</b> structure that Ti assumes above the β-transus...|$|R
5|$|Steel {{base metal}} is iron, which {{is able to}} take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one {{at the center of}} each of the six faces of the cube.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{moderately}} hard, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic)</b> and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (<b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic)</b> and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E

Its low-temperature orthorhombic form converts to the higher symmetry <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> form at room temperature, like other metal hexafluorides such as RhF6 and OsF6. Preliminary measurements of magnetic moment yield a value of 0.45 µB, which is lower than expected for a d1 octahedral compound.|$|E

50|$|From 912 to 1394 C {{alpha iron}} {{undergoes}} a phase transition from <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> (BCC) to the face-centred cubic (FCC) configuration of gamma iron, also called austenite. This is similarly soft and ductile but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.03% by mass at 1146 C).

50|$|Bismuth oxide, Bi2O3 {{has five}} crystallographic polymorphs. The room {{temperature}} phase, α-Bi2O3 has a monoclinic crystal structure. There are three high temperature phases, a tetragonal β-phase, a <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> γ-phase, a cubic δ-Bi2O3 phase and an ε- phase.The room temperature α-phase has a complex structure {{with layers of}} oxygen atoms with layers of bismuth atoms between them.

50|$|In {{crystalline}} solids, {{the particles}} (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different crystal structures, {{and the same}} substance can {{have more than one}} structure (or solid phase). For example, iron has a <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> structure at temperatures below 912 °C, and a face-centred cubic structure between 912 and 1394 °C. Ice has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.|$|E
50|$|The {{hexagonal}} form spontaneously {{changes to}} normal chromium in 40 days, {{whereas the other}} form (face-centred cubic) changes to the <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> form of chromium in 230 days at room temperature. Ollard already noticed that hydrogen is evolved during this transformation, but was {{not sure that the}} hydrogen was an essential component of the substance, as electrodeposited chromium usually contained hydrogen. Colin G Fink observed that if the hexagonal form was heated in a flame that the hydrogen would quickly burn off.|$|E
50|$|Self-assembly is {{the most}} common term in use in the modern {{scientific}} community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the 7 crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy (e.g. face-centred cubic, <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic,</b> etc.). The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (or lattice parameter) in each particular case.|$|E

50|$|Below 910 C the body-centered-cubic allotrope of {{pure iron}} is stable. Above this {{temperature}} the face-centred cubic allotrope of iron, austenite (gamma-iron) is stable. Above 1390 C, {{up to the}} melting point at 1539 C, the <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> crystal structure is again the more stable form, as delta-ferrite (δ-Fe). Ferrite above the critical temperature A2 (Curie temperature) of 771 C, where it is paramagnetic rather than ferromagnetic, is known as beta ferrite or beta iron (β-Fe). The term beta iron is not used any longer because it is crystallographically identical to, and its phase field contiguous with, α-iron.|$|E
50|$|Even in {{the narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} which make up zirconium hydride, mixtures of hydrogen and zirconium can form {{a number of different}} structures, with very different properties. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality zirconium hydride. At room temperature, the most stable form of zirconium is the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure α-zirconium. It is a fairly soft metallic material that can dissolve only a small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.069 wt% at 550 °C. If zirconium hydride contains more than 0.069% hydrogen at zirconium hydride making temperatures then it transforms into a <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> (BCC) structure called β-zirconium. It can dissolve considerably more hydrogen, more than 1.2% hydrogen above 900 °C.|$|E
50|$|The monoclinic α-phase {{transforms}} to the cubic δ-Bi2O3 when heated above 729 °C, {{which remains}} the structure until the melting point, 824 °C, is reached. The behaviour of Bi2O3 on cooling from the δ-phase is more complex, {{with the possible}} formation of two intermediate metastable phases; the tetragonal β-phase or the <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> γ-phase. The γ-phase can exist at room temperature with very slow cooling rates, but α- Bi2O3 always forms on cooling the β-phase. Even though when formed by heat, it reverts to α- Bi2O3 when the temperature drops back below 727 °C, δ-Bi2O3 can be formed directly through electrodeposition and remain relatively stable at room temperature, in an electrolyte of bismuth compounds that is also rich in sodium or potassium hydroxide so as to have a pH near 14.|$|E

5000|$|A face-centered cubic (fcc) {{phase of}} {{chromium}} hydride {{can also be}} produced when chromium is electrodeposited. Cloyd A. Snavely used chromate in sugar syrup cooled to about 5 °C and with a current density of 1290 amperes per square meter. The unit cell dimension in the material was 0.386 nm. The material is brittle and easily decomposed by heat. The composition is CrHx, with x between 1 and 2. [...] For current density above 1800 amps per square meter and at low temperatures, the hexagonal close-packed form was made, but if the current was lower or the temperature was higher, then regular <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> chromium metal was deposited. [...] The condition for preferring the formation of face-centered cubic chromium hydride is a high pH. The fcc form of CrH has hydrogen atoms in octahedaral sites in the P63/mmc spacegroup.|$|E
50|$|The Curie {{temperature}} of nanoparticles are also {{affected by the}} crystal lattice structure, <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> (bcc), face-centred cubic (fcc) and a hexagonal structure (hcp) all have different Curie temperatures due to magnetic moments reacting to their neighbouring electron spins. fcc and hcp have tighter structures and as a results have higher Curie temperatures than bcc as the magnetic moments have stronger effects when closer together. This {{is known as the}} coordination number which is the number of nearest neighbouring particles in a structure. This indicates a lower coordination number at the surface of a material than the bulk which leads to the surface becoming less significant when the temperature is approaching the Curie temperature. In smaller systems the coordination number for the surface is more significant and the magnetic moments have a stronger affect on the system.|$|E
50|$|Electroplating {{chromium}} metal from a chromate solution involves {{the formation of}} chromium hydride. If the temperature is high enough the chromium hydride rapidly decomposes as it forms, yielding microcrystalline <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> chromium. Therefore, {{to ensure that the}} hydride decomposes sufficiently rapidly and smoothly, chromium must be plated at a suitably high temperature (roughly 60C to 75C, depending on conditions). As the hydride decomposes, the plated surface cracks. The cracking can be controlled and there may be up to 40 cracks per millimeter. Substances on the plating surface, mostly chromium sesquioxide, are sucked into the cracks as they form. The cracks heal over and newer electroplated layers will crack differently. When observed with a microscope the electroplated chromium will appear to be in the form of crystals with 120° and 60° angles, but these are the ghosts of the original hydride crystals; the actual crystals that finally form in the coating are much smaller and consist of body centred cubic chromium.|$|E
50|$|In {{the narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} that make up iron hydride at atmospheric pressure, mixtures of hydrogen and iron can form {{a small number of}} different structures. At room temperature, the most stable form of iron is the <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> (BCC) structure, α-ferrite. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a very small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.0004 wt% at 912 C, and only 0.0002% at 25 C. If iron hydride is at iron hydride-making temperatures it transforms into a face-centred cubic (FCC) structure, called austenite or γ-iron. It is also soft and metallic and can dissolve somewhat more hydrogen, as much as 0.0009% hydrogen at 1,394 C. If iron hydride is at temperatures higher than 1,394 C it transforms into a different BCC structure, called δ-iron. It can dissolve even more hydrogen, as much as 0.001% hydrogen at 1,538 C, which reflects the upper hydrogen content of iron hydride.|$|E

50|$|A micellar cubic {{phase is}} a lyotropic liquid crystal phase formed when the {{concentration}} of micelles dispersed in a solvent (usually water) is sufficiently high that {{they are forced to}} pack into a structure having long-ranged positional (translational) order. For example, spherical micelles a subic packing of a <b>body-centred</b> <b>cubic</b> lattice. Normal topology micellar cubic phases, denoted by the symbol I1, are the first lyotropic liquid crystalline phases that are formed by type I amphiphiles. The amphiphiles' hydrocarbon tails are contained {{on the inside of the}} micelle and hence the polar-apolar interface of the aggregates has a positive mean curvature, by definition (it curves away from the polar phase). Inverse topology micellar cubic phases (such as the Fd3m phase) are observed for some type II amphiphiles at very high amphiphile concentrations. These aggregates, in which water is the minority phase, have a polar-apolar interface with a negative mean curvature. The structures of the normal topology micellar cubic phases that are formed by some types of amphiphiles (e.g. the oligoethyleneoxide monoalkyl ether series of non-ionic surfactants are the subject of debate. Micellar cubic phases are isotropic phases, but are distinguished from micellar solutions by their very high viscosity. When thin film samples of micellar cubic phases are viewed under a polarising microscope they appear dark and featureless. Small air bubbles trapped in these preparations tend to appear highly distorted and occasionally have faceted surfaces.|$|E
