5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of the ruined church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios {{with a plan}} to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. Palacios completed a design that fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His final design was said to have been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore.|$|E
25|$|A keyhole fire {{is made in}} a keyhole-shaped fire ring, and is used in cooking. The large round area is used to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{to create}} coals. As coals develop, they are scraped into the {{rectangular}} area used for cooking.|$|E
50|$|Morris grows {{anxious about}} his life—his wife is miserable, his {{daughter}} {{on her way}} to spinsterhood and his poor business no more than a prison. Morris turns down an arsonists offer to burn his home and store for the insurance money, but then <b>builds</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> himself. <b>As</b> the flames catch on his apron, Morris is saved by Frank. After being saved, Morris sends Frank away again.|$|R
5000|$|Kiln {{technology}} is very old. The {{development of the}} kiln from a simple earthen trench filled with pots and fuel, pit firing, to modern methods happened in stages. One improvement was to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> chamber around pots with baffles and a stoking hole. This conserved heat. A chimney stack improves the air flow or draw of the kiln, thus burning the fuel more completely.|$|R

25|$|The Qissa-i Sanjan {{is a tale}} of {{the journey}} of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of {{religious}} freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local Hindu prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> temple.|$|E
500|$|In a Shawnee tale, the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit, {{which gives}} rise to its spots. After {{trapping}} the rabbit in a tree, the bobcat is persuaded to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> {{only to have the}} embers scattered on its fur, leaving it singed with dark brown spots. The Mohave believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers. Dreaming of two deities, cougar and lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes. European settlers to the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and its grace, and in the United States, it [...] "rests prominently in the anthology of... national folklore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like the Model T car, a Fordson tractor {{that was}} {{relatively}} new and well maintained would start easily in warm weather. Under such conditions, often a single crank pull would start it. However, in cold weather, starting could be difficult, especially once the machines were 10, 20, or 30 {{years old and}} worn out. In cold weather, the oil congealed on the cylinder walls and on the clutch plates. The engine had to be hand cranked repeatedly with great effort. [...] Strong men took turns cranking between intervals when individual ignition coils were adjusted. [...] Sometimes farmers would <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> under the tractor to warm up the crankcase and gear boxes to make it crank easier. [...] The tractor, when in use, was fueled by kerosene, but gasoline was required to start it.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} and the study of semantics equivalence for interleaving and concurrent systems over some class of Open Petri Nets. We <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> and step semantics for a class of Petri net in order to define their behaviours. To do that we need some properties that allow us to assert that a concurrent step can always be rewritten in <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> sequence. Finally we show the coincidence between the two semantics using the notion of bisimulation and bisimilarity...|$|R
50|$|In 1918 a black chain gang {{prisoner}} {{is running}} {{through an open}} field, presumably after escaping his confinement. When nightfall arrives he <b>builds</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and, using his sickle, he burns off his tattooed prison number, 48073. After taking refuge in <b>a</b> forest, he <b>builds</b> himself <b>a</b> small hut out of brush and branches to wait until he feels it's safe to leave. Soon thereafter he begins to hear noises that are uncommon with his natural surroundings, but ignores it.|$|R
5000|$|The last Wednesday {{of the old}} {{winter is}} known as [...] "Kal Char Shenba". On this day, every family <b>builds</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{in front of their}} house, and every member of the family jumps over it while saying [...] "Burea Qa o Biyea Shadi", bidding sadness to go and joy to stay. Households also prepare a soup called Ach, and offer it to their neighbors. As a sign of {{kindness}} to one another, the Ach dish is not washed.|$|R
2500|$|On Christmas Eve, {{the men of}} {{the family}} <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in their house yard, and roast a pig, or a sheep in some areas, on a long wooden spit. The whole roasted pig or sheep, called pečenica, is a {{traditional}} part of Christmas dinner. People who raise their own swine dedicate one for the pečenica a month or two before, and feed it with better fodder. It is traditionally killed on Tucindan, the day before Christmas Eve, by hitting on the head with a lump of salt. Its throat was then cut, the blood being collected and mixed with fodder. Feeding cattle with this mixture was believed to make them thrive. The name Tucindan is derived from the verb tući [...] "to beat". The roasted pečenica may be brought into the house with a ritual similar to that of bringing in the badnjak.|$|E
2500|$|The second search flight {{took off}} at 2310 AT, 21 February 1947, in B-29 45-21761 (Boeing's Boner). [...] As the Kee Birds navigators were {{constantly}} making celestial observations {{in order to}} aid the search planes in locating them, the mission was much easier since more information was received as to the lost airplane's approximate position. [...] In addition, more time was available in which to plan the mission, and a direct course was set to Greenland. [...] On reaching the area where Kee Bird had landed at 0745 AT, a search was started and with information from the lost crew. [...] The first actual sighting was made at 0830 AT. [...] Eight runs were made over the downed plane, dropping the supplies carried for that purpose. [...] Kee Birds crew requested that some coal be dropped to them in order that they could <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> for warmth and cooking. [...] The crew was instructed to destroy the radar, Loran, and the IFF sets, and to bring back, when they were evacuated, all exposed film, airplane files and all maps. [...] 21761 then returned to Ladd and landed safely.|$|E

50|$|The {{other method}} is <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> {{position}} and recoil pit (épi de tir in French) underneath the tracks, using either heavy timbers like the French 340 mm and 400 mm howitzers or an elaborate concrete or steel base.

Generally, for these emplacements the rails merely served to guide the gun into position and the gun was often mounted on a central pivot to allow up to 360° of traverse.
