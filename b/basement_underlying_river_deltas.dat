50|$|The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, {{dating to}} between 53.5 and 48.5 million years old. This {{span of time}} {{includes}} the transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over <b>underlying</b> <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements, receiving sediments from the Uinta highland and the Rocky Mountains {{to the east and}} north. The lagerstätten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away, so leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage they had sustained during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets.|$|R
40|$|Major {{initiatives}} have been taken, and are proposed by Australian Government agencies {{to improve the}} efficiency of the water industry and to assist in achieving the ecologically sustainable use of the nation’s water resources. The Queensland Department of Natural Resources (QDNR) is currently implementing a new system for allocating and managing water in Queensland. QDNR is developing a groundwater management model to study the behaviour of the groundwater system <b>underlying</b> the Burdekin <b>River</b> <b>Delta</b> area in north Queensland in order to evaluate water management strategies to ensure that irrigation in the Delta is sustainable. This model will be a predictive tool to study the effects of changes in land and water use on groundwater levels, and will include the spatial and temporal variation of hydrogeologic characteristics and hydrologic responses in the Delta aquifer system. Conceptualisation and characterisation of the aquifer system are fundamental steps in groundwater modelling and this has become an important process in simplifying the aquifer system so that field data can be easily transferred into the computer model. The Burdekin <b>River</b> <b>Delta</b> aquifers comprise sedimentary deposits in excess of 100 metres thick overlying a predominantly granitic basement. The nature of sedimentation is very complex with sediments comprising a mixture of interbedded gravel, sand, silt, mud and clay. The sediments are rarely continuous laterally, with layer...|$|R

In addition, it presents qualitative interviews made with two experts, focusing {{on the development of}} bird and fish populations in the observed <b>river</b> <b>deltas.</b> These <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> are the Årøy Delta near Sogndal, the Lærdal Delta at Lærdal, the Sogndalsfjøra Delta at Sogndal, the Gaupne Delta at Gaupne, the Gudvangen Delta at Gudvangen, the Skjolden Delta at Skjolden the Årdalstangen Delta at Årdalstangen, the Bøyaøyra Delta near Fjærland, the Vetlefjordøyra Delta at Vetlefjorden and the Flåm Delta at Flåm. The observed <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> are habitats for fish and bird populations. The deltas are used as resting places, feeding grounds, nesting areas and for nursery. All the observed <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> are influenced by human activity. Two of these <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> have changed from > 50 % natural to 50 % natural to > 25 % cultivated. Four out of the ten observed <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> have changed from > 50 % natural to >> 50 % urban. Three <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> changed from > 50 % urban to >> 50 % urban. The natural delta area of six out of ten <b>river</b> <b>deltas</b> decreased by more than 50 % between the 1960 s and the 2010 s due to land fillings, road buildings and harbor constructions. These results suggest that the progressing destruction of the natural <b>river</b> <b>delta</b> environment had a declining effect on the fish and bird population of the region.
