Consequently, there is increasing interest in quantifying {{the scale of the}} problem. Accumulation rates of debris on beaches have been advocated as a useful proxy for at-sea debris loads.

Our study of debris on a small beach in eastern Australia indicates that estimated daily accumulation rates decrease rapidly with increasing intervals between surveys, and the quantity of available debris is underestimated by 50 % after only 3 days and by an order of magnitude after 1 month.

The {{concept of}} complex {{stiffness}} in problems of oscillations with viscous, or structural (hysteretic) damping {{is often used}} in a wrong way, leading to erroneous solutions.

This requires further experimental work. - 1. Introduction. [...] The first systematic experiments on structural damping were reported as early as 1927 by Kimball and LovelP and 1928 by Becker and F 6 ppF. They both led to the conclusion that this sort of damping, if occurring in oscillatory systems of a single degree of freedom performing simple harmonic oscillations of small amplitudes, might be treated approximately by the usual linear method (as viscous damping), i. e., by assuming that the dampin...|$|R
40|$|Many conferences, meetings, workshops, {{summer schools}} and symposia on {{nonlinear}} dynamical systems are being organized these days, {{dealing with a}} great variety of topics and themes -classical and quantum, theoretical and experimental. Some focus on integrability, or discuss the mathematical foundations of chaos. Others explore the beauty of fractals, or examine endless possibilities of applications to problems of physics, chemistry, biology and other sciences. A new scientific discipline has thus emerged, with its own distinct philosophical viewpoint and an impressive arsenal of new methods and techniques, which may be called Chaotic Dynamics.

40|$|A diverse set of cell surface {{eukaryotic}} proteins including receptors, enzymes, and adhesion molecules have a glycosylphosphoinositol-lipid (GPI) modification at the carboxy-terminal {{end that}} serves as their sole means of membrane anchoring. These GPI-anchored proteins are poorly solubilized in nonionic detergent such as Triton X- 100. In addition these detergent-insoluble complexes from plasma membranes are significantly enriched in several cytoplasmic proteins including nonreceptor-type tyrosine kinases and caveolin/VIP- 21, {{a component of the}} striated coat of caveolae. These observations have suggested that the detergent-insoluble complexes represent purified caveolar membrane preparations. However, we have recently shown by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy that GPI-anchored proteins are diffusely distributed at the cell surface but may be enriched in caveolae only after cross-linking. Although caveolae occupy {{only a small fraction of}} the cell surface (< 4 %), almost all of the GPI-anchored protein at the cell surface becomes incorporated into detergent-insoluble low-density complexes. In this paper we show that upon detergent treatment the GPI-anchored proteins are redistributed into a significantly more clustered distribution in the remaining membranous structures. These results show that GPI-anchored proteins are intrinsically detergent-insoluble in the milieu of the plasma membrane, and their co-purification with caveolin is not reflective of their native distribution. These results also indicate that the association of caveolae, GPI-anchored proteins, and signalling proteins must <b>be</b> <b>critically</b> <b>re-examined...</b>|$|R

However, some important aspects of the disease mechanism are not yet fully understood. In particular, there is no consensus as yet on whether the disease acts through a loss or a gain of function mechanism (Van Broeck et al, 2007). AD and cerebrovascular dementia are two common causes of dementia and, by present diagnostic criteria, are mutually exclusive using vascular pathology as an arbitrary demarcation in differential diagnosis. However, evidence from epidemiological, neuropathological, clinical, pharmacological, and functional studies suggest considerable overlap in risk factors and pathological changes suggesting shared common pathogenic mechanisms between these two diseases such that vascular factors play a vital role in the pathogenesis of AD (Zhu et al, 2007). AD is associated with considerably decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) thought to be secondary, since dead neurons do not need oxygen and glucose.

This improved version turns out to be still not completely unproblematic, but it is argued that it contains only a single actual loophole, which is identical to a loophole that remains in experimental proofs of nonlocality of Bell-type. It is concluded that - {{within the context of the}} standard quantum kinematical framework and in agreement with what has been concluded by earlier authors - a nonlinear dynamics of density operators is inconsistent with relativistic causality. However, it is also stressed that this conclusion in itself has little implication for the nature of dynamics at the Hilbert space level - in particular, it does not force dynamics to be linear at this level - nor does it continue to be valid in contexts that go beyond the standard quantum kinematical framework. Despite their seeming triviality, these last two points have not always been appreciated in the literature. Finally, it is also pointed out that the argument for complete positivity, as given in conjunction with one of the two recent {{arguments for}} linear dynamics, in fact only establishes a condition that is weaker than complete positivity.

The data available has <b>been</b> <b>critically</b> <b>re-examined</b> {{with a view to}} establishing the associated palynological, spatial and temporal trends. The decline is generally agreed to be a non-synchronous event caused by anthropogenic activity. In this re-examination only sites where declines (individual sites may exhibit several declines) have been directly dated or where an age can be interpolated have been included. Of the 164 declines examined 44 % can be attributed to processes relating to the depositional environment (e. g. breaks in sedimentation, paludification, marine inundation). Analysis of the remaining declines suggests a number of important spatial / temporal trends in anthropogenic activity (e. g. sites where the soils are calcareous or loamy, as against sandy, are cleared earlier, with clearance activity declining during a period of climatic deterioration), which remain after problematic sites are excluded. The well-known Ulmus decline is also discussed, demonstrating that current assumptions over the processes (e. g. the role of disease, climate change, human activity or interaction of several of these) cannot be effectively tested. It is shown that differences {{in the nature of the}} sites, methodologies adopted, etc., obscure the signal.

We confirm that the data cannot accommodate a QCD scale parameter (Ʌ(_MS)) smaller than about 150 MeV, whereas we find no constraint on larger values of the scale parameter, contrary to a previous analysis. The effects of dynamical heavy quark masses in the loop correction to the perturbative potential is studied in detail and the effective four quark theory with a massive charmed quark is found to give an accurate description of the perturbative potential for quarkonia of mass up to about 250 GeV. Predictions for the heavy quarkonium system of toponium {{are found to be}} very sensitive to the behaviour of the short-distance region of the potential and it is argued that the experimental determination of the mass and e(^+) (^-) decay width of the 1 S and 2 S toponium resonances (of mass around 80 GeV) with accuracy anticipated at the forthcoming e(^+) e(^-) colliders should enable the QCD scale parameter to be determined to within ± 100 MeV. The hadronic decays of the lowest S- and P-wave states of charmonium and bottomonium are examined in the light of recent experimental determination.

In Norfolk these developments are poorly understood {{due to a lack of}} early documentary evidence, a complex pattern of landholdings portrayed in Domesday and the disruption caused by Scandinavian settlement. Traditional views on these territorial organisations <b>are</b> <b>critically</b> <b>re-examined</b> using an extensive compilation of settlement, church and archaeological data from the county SMR. This study has revealed a complex landscape that cannot be easily generalised. It challenges existing views about the distribution of settlement and local churches, the usefulness of Domesday and previous assumptions about the impact of Scandinavian settlement. Case studies have been analysed in detail to demonstrate the many subtle differences in the landscape evident at a local level that are not apparent at a county level of consideration. There is evidence to support the idea that great estates were once present in the county, but there is little to demonstrate that a system of minster churches once existed. This research has also shown that parish units can be used to demonstrate many aspects of the landscape that cannot easily be recovered by other methods. At the core of this study is the use of GIS data management software which has proven to be a powerful research tool for landscape analysis and allows contrasts and comparisons to be made with the data that would not have been possible by other methods...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to {{modelling}} of dry sliding friction between contacting surfaces and related problems of contact mechanics. To {{limit the number of}} physical phenomena involved, the studies are targeted to systems used in vacuum conditions, hence {{there is no need to}} consider environmental parameters, such as humidity or oxidation films. Although friction has been studied over many years, challenges remain for obtaining a comprehensive understanding and a quantitative description of influence of nanometre scale effects on friction at micro/macro levels. Many existing models <b>are</b> <b>critically</b> <b>re-examined</b> using ideas of nanoscience. The studies start from the classic Zhuravlev model well-known as the Greenwood - Williamson model representing rough surfaces as collections of spherical elastic asperities. Contact problems for bodies of various shapes are investigated using the Galin solution along with the Borodich rescaling formulae. The rescaling method is applied to indentation experiments by spherical and nominally sharp punches and then a way to model dry friction following Zhuravlev’s arguments is outlined. New ways for numerical simulations of dry sliding friction are presented assuming the friction force is defined by the total energy dissipated over the sliding distance. Novel hierarchical, multiscale, multilevel structural models for simulation of sliding dry friction are presented. The models reflect the physical mechanisms which are most relevant to dry friction at the specific length scales: the chemical interactions at the atomic scale, the adhesive (van der Waals) interactions at the nanoscale, and the mechanical interlocking of asperities and their coupling at the micro and macroscales. Although the models include some features of known models, the nanotribological interpretation of the features is novel. It is argued that the nano-asperities do not deform plastically due to the so-called Polonsky-Keer effect. The obtained results are in good agreement with the experimental observations found in literature...|$|R
40|$|As in {{the other}} parts of the book, in this part {{culturally}} entrenched boundaries and demarcations <b>are</b> also <b>critically</b> <b>re-examined</b> in light of the arrival of the Anthropocene as a new geological era. Here the focus is on rethinking the received distinction between humans and non-human animals. In a long series of discourses making up our cultural heritage, we humans have persistently tried to define the essence of our own humanity and to distinguish ourselves from other animals by laying claim to supposedly unique capacities and achievements like reason, language, morality, religion, technology, law and politics. By now, however, human exceptionalism in its cruder forms has definitely gone out of fashion. None of the contributors to this part of the book subscribes to such versions, but each has different views on how far the critique of human supremacy should be pursued and where the new boundaries should be redrawn, if at all. The issues raised in these contributions are of central importance for the reorientation of animal ethics and environmental ethics in the Age of the Anthropocene...|$|R
