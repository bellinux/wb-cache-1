30|$|As {{one of the}} key {{technologies}} for <b>microphone</b> arrays, broadband <b>beamforming</b> has been used {{in a wide range of}} audio and speech processing applications, such as teleconferencing, hearing aids, and audio surveillance [1 – 6]. The most popular methods for broadband <b>beamforming</b> for <b>microphone</b> arrays are based on the well-known filter-and-sum structure [2]. In practice, sound source of interest may move around some angular range. Accordingly, the passband width of a broadband beamformer usually needs to be designed to cover the whole angular range of movement of the sound source. 1 It is known that, there is a trade-off between passband width and stopband attenuation for a filter-and-sum broadband beamformer, i.e., the larger the passband width, the worse the stopband attenuation, and vice versa. 2 As a result, the spatial filtering performance of filter-and-sum broadband beamformers will deteriorate greatly when the sound source is moving around a wide angular range. To combat this problem, one promising solution is to design steerable broadband beamformers, where their passbands can be adjusted dynamically with a simple scheme, with no need of redesign of the broadband beamformers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{near-field}} broadband adap-tive beamforming scheme for intelligent computer telephony and teleconferencing applications, namely the nested microphone array with adaptive noise canceller (NMA-ANC). The NMA-ANC scheme incorporates an harmonically nested array with a nonuni-formly subbanded multirate filter bank. Each subband array employs several near-field delay-filter-and-sum beamformers and an adaptive noise canceller (ANC). The proposed NMA-ANC is evaluated via a noise rejection experiment and dereverberation experiment performed in an anechoic chamber {{and a real}} confer-ence room, respectively. The experiment data are recorded by a multichannel digital recording system developed using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipments. A perceptual analysis/measure-ment system (PAMS) test is also carried out using a COTS digital speech level analyzer. The results of the experimental evaluation and PAMS test show that the proposed NMA-ANC scheme is able to improve the sound quality by adaptively rejecting multiple interfering signals and attenuating the reverberant noises and avoiding the desired signal cancellation.

40|$|Unequally spaced {{transducer}} rings make {{it possible}} to extend the range of detectable azimuthal modes. The {{other side of the coin}} is that the response of the mode detection algorithm to a single mode is distributed over all detectable modes, similarly to the Point Spread Function of Conventional <b>Beamforming</b> with <b>microphone</b> arrays. With multiple modes the response patterns interfere, leading to a relatively high “noise floor” of spurious modes in the detected mode spectrum, in other words, to a low dynamic range. In this paper a deconvolution strategy is proposed for increasing this dynamic range. It starts with separating the measured sound into shaft tones and broadband noise. For broadband noise modes, a standard Non-Negative Least Squares solver appeared to be a perfect deconvolution tool. For shaft tones a Matching Pursuit approach is proposed, taking advantage of the sparsity of dominant modes. The deconvolution methods were applied to mode detection measurements in an AneCom fan rig. An increase in dynamic range of typically 10 to 15 dB was found. </p...|$|R

Adding spatial diversity to the repertoire of signal acquisition has long been known to offer advantages for processing signals further.

But current processing capabilities are such that the extra workload introduced by the addition of mutiple sensors on a mobile device are not over-burdensome.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{adaptive}} microphone array processing algorithm for hands-free sound capture. Most traditional adaptive beamforming techniques operate {{solely on the basis}} of the direction of arrival of the desired source and are blind to any knowledge about the signal itself. In contrast, the proposed algorithm uses a nonlinear spatial filter to generate an estimate of the magnitude of the source signal. This estimate is then used to drive the adaptation of a linear beamformer according to a log-MMSE criterion. By combining a nonlinear spatial filter with an adaptive beamformer in this manner, we are able to exploit the high SNR output from the nonlinear spatial filter to drive a linear beamformer that does not suffer from distortions or artifacts. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method generates improvements in PESQ and SNR over conventional methods.
