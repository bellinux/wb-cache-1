The Panthers then defeated the Atlanta Falcons, who were 6–9 and undefeated within the division entering the game, for the division title.

5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. <b>By</b> <b>Week</b> 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.|$|E
5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win the NFC East title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. <b>By</b> <b>Week</b> 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating Dallas to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans to fire him. However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win the NFC East. The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the NFC East with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career.|$|E

25|$|During {{the preseason}} of 2001, Eskimos head coach Don Matthews {{was fired in}} a famously messy separation, {{allegedly}} for health reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Tom Higgins. Higgins would later develop a reputation for changing quarterbacks frequently, and although the flashy Greene had been the starter in Edmonton for two years, his spotty arm was beginning to draw criticism from fans. The door was wide open for the two backups, Crowley and Maas, to show that they could take the reins from the faltering Greene. Crowley was strong and Greene fought valiantly to keep his job, but <b>by</b> <b>Week</b> 7 it was Maas who had taken the starting quarterback spot that he would keep {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|In {{his inaugural}} year, the Bears ended their 2004 {{campaign}} at 5–11. For the first goal, Lovie Smith aimed to defeat their historic rival, the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. However, <b>by</b> <b>Week</b> 7, the Bears recorded a poor starting record of 1–5, {{with the only}} win against Green Bay {{largely due to the}} Week 3 road game loss to the Minnesota Vikings. There, they lost starting quarterback Rex Grossman from a season-ending knee injury. From then on, they cycled through three different quarterbacks: Craig Krenzel, Jonathan Quinn, and Chad Hutchinson. After a modest three-game win streak from Week 8 to 10, the Bears capped the streak in their Week 10 (19–17) win over the Tennessee Titans in overtime with a safety. That was the second time in NFL history that a game ended in overtime on a safety. Afterwards, the Bears ended up losing six of the remaining seven games.|$|E

The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs <b>by</b> <b>Week</b> 11, when they stood 0–10.
