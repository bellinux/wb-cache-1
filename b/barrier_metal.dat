50|$|A <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> is a {{material}} used in integrated circuits to chemically isolate semiconductors from soft metal interconnects, while maintaining an electrical connection between them.

50|$|A <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> layer must {{completely}} surround all copper interconnections, since {{diffusion of}} copper into surrounding materials would degrade their properties. For instance, silicon forms deep-level traps when doped with copper. As the name implies, a <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> must limit copper diffusivity sufficiently to chemically isolate the copper conductor from the silicon below, yet have high electrical conductivity {{in order to}} maintain a good electronic contact.|$|E

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, a <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> must have high {{electrical}} conductivity {{in order to}} maintain a good electronic contact, while maintaining a low enough copper diffusivity to sufficiently chemically isolate these copper conductor films from underlying device silicon. The thickness of the barrier films is also quite important; with too thin a barrier layer, the inner copper may contact and poison the very devices that they supply with energy and information; with barrier layers too thick, these wrapped stacks of two <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> films and an inner copper conductor can have a greater total resistance than the traditional aluminum interconnections would have, eliminating any benefit derived from the new metallization technology.|$|E
50|$|A {{layer of}} a {{suitable}} <b>barrier</b> <b>metal,</b> usually nickel, is often deposited on the copper substrate before the gold plating.

50|$|Transition-metal nitrides, such as TiN and TaN find {{potential}} {{use both}} as <b>metal</b> <b>barriers</b> and as gate <b>metals.</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are used in}} modern Cu-based chips to avoid diffusion of Cu into the surrounding materials, such as insulators and the silicon substrate, and also, to prevent Cu contamination by elements diffusing from the insulators by surrounding every Cu interconnection {{with a layer of}} <b>metal</b> <b>barriers.</b> The <b>metal</b> <b>barriers</b> have strict demands: they should be pure; dense; conductive; conformal; thin; have good adhesion towards metals and insulators. The requirements concerning process technique can be fulfilled by ALD. The most studied ALD nitride is TiN which is deposited from TiCl4 and NH3.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many {{semiconductor}} {{integrated circuit}} manufacturing processes require high dose of implantation {{at very low}} energies. Conventional beam line ion implantation system suffers from low beam current at low energies, therefore, cannot be used economically for high dose applications. Plasma immersion ion implanta-tion (PIII) is emerging as a potential technique for such implantations. This method offers high dose rate irre-spective of implantation energy. In the present study nitrogen ions were implanted using PIII in order to modify the properties of silicon and some refractory metal films.

50|$|Gold plating {{is often}} used in electronics, to provide a {{corrosion-resistant}} electrically conductive layer on copper, typically in electrical connectors and printed circuit boards. With direct gold-on-copper plating, the copper atoms have the tendency to diffuse through the gold layer, causing tarnishing of its surface and formation of an oxide/sulfide layer. Therefore, a layer of a suitable <b>barrier</b> <b>metal,</b> usually nickel, has to be deposited on the copper substrate, forming a copper-nickel-gold sandwich.|$|E
50|$|Gold plating {{of silver}} {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of jewelry. Like copper, silver atoms diffuse into the gold layer, causing slow gradual fading of its color and eventually causing tarnishing of the surface. This process may take months and even years, depending on the thickness of the gold layer. A <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> layer is used to counter this effect. Copper, which also migrates into gold, does so more slowly than silver. The copper is usually further plated with nickel. A gold-plated silver article is usually a silver substrate with layers of copper, nickel, and gold deposited on top of it.|$|E
50|$|The {{improvement}} in conductivity in going from earlier aluminium to copper based conductors was modest, {{and not as}} good as to be expected by a simple comparison of bulk conductivities of aluminium and copper. The addition of barrier metals on all four sides of the copper conductor significantly reduces the cross-sectional area of the conductor that is composed of pure, low resistance, copper. Aluminium, while requiring a thin <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> to promote low ohmic resistance when making a contact directly to silicon or aluminium layers, did not require barrier metals {{on the sides of the}} metal lines to isolate aluminium from the surrounding silicon oxide insulators.Therefore scientists are looking for new ways to reduce the diffusion of Cu into Si substrates without using the buffer layer. One method is to use Cu-Ge alloy as the interconnect material so that buffer layer (e.g. TiN) is no longer needed. Epitaxial Cu3Ge layer has been fabricated with an average resistivity of 6 ± 1 μΩ cm and work function of ~4.47 ± 0.02 eV respectively, qualifying it as a good alternative to Cu.|$|E

For all metals, current density during polishing in the slurry when using APS as an oxidizer was greater than when using H 2 O 2 as an oxidizer, due to the strong reactivity of APS with exposed metal surfaces. The potential of Ru during polishing is {{greater than that of}} Cu, indicating that Ru is more noble than Cu and suggesting the high potential for Cu galvanic corrosion in APS slurry. In the case of Ta, Cu is more noble than Ta, rendering Cu stable. In H 2 O 2 slurry, Ru and Cu show similar potential and low current density, rendering Cu stable. However, dipping an exposed <b>metal</b> <b>barrier</b> window led to abrupt changes in Cu potential in all slurries, a finding that suggests Cu may generate corrosion...|$|R

40|$|Soldering is {{a process}} that joins two metal parts with a low-melting-point metal or alloy, called solder. It is widely {{recognized}} that intermetallic compound (IMC) formation is essential for the solder to bond to metals. The IMC layer grows during soldering. It grows further during usage, in particular, at temperature near the solder melting temperature. Extensive IMC growth can result in reliability issues. A reason is that IMC is much less ductile than the solder and does not deform as much as the solder to manage the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between the parts joined. In this paper, we looked into and developed a soldering process to fabricate IMC-less solder joints. The fundamental concept is to choose a <b>barrier</b> <b>metal</b> that can bond to solder without forming IMC with the solder. With our experience and Cr-Sn phase diagram, Cr is selected as the <b>barrier</b> <b>metal.</b> Several bonding experiments have been performed and the preliminary results show that high quality Sn joints could be produced with a little IMC formation before high-temperature aging. After aging at homologous temperature of 0. 9 of Sn for 100 - 200 h, Cu- 6 Sn 5 and Cu 3 Sn IMCs are observed. They are caused by the penetration of molten Sn through microcracks or pinholes on the Cr layer to react with the underlying Cu. In production environment, the density of microcracks and pinholes can be greatly reduced to inhibit IMC growth, making the realization of solder joints without IMC a possibility. © 2011 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E
