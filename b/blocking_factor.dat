The cells involved were removed by treatment with antibodies to certain membrane markers (Thy- 1, Ly- 2, Ia, I-J) but not by anti-Ly- 1 antibodies. Removal of adherent cells also prevented production of <b>blocking</b> <b>factors,</b> which was restored by reconstitution with syngeneic but not allogeneic cells from normal mice.

40|$|Serum <b>blocking</b> <b>factors,</b> {{detected}} in sera of inbred CBA and BALB/c mice with progressing virus-induced tumors by their interference with leukocyte-adherence inhibition (LAI) {{with the use}} of syngeneic leukocytes, were found to be strain related: No blocking occurred with allogeneic leukocytes. Furthermore, the unblocking factors of regressor serum were also strain related: No unblocking of allogeneic progressor serum was observed. There was no requirement for H- 2 compatibility between leukocytes and tumor cells from which the LAI-inducing antigen was obtained. Absorption of CBA blocking serum with anti-I-J antiserum (and with anti-I containing this antibody specificity) removed blocking activity; absorption of regressor serum did not reduce its unblocking activity. These observations indicated that certain <b>blocking</b> <b>factors</b> resembled other suppressor factors in possessing antigenic determinants coded by the l-J subregion of the major histocompatibility complex. Their strain restriction and antigen specificity suggested combination with reactive lymphocytes in blocking LAI. The properties of unblocking factors suggested they combine with <b>blocking</b> <b>factors</b> and resemble antiidiotypic antibodies. —JNCI 1981; 66 : 1097 - 1102...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Previous studies, using plasmapheresis {{to remove}} <b>blocking</b> <b>factors</b> of cell-mediated cytotoxity to {{melanoma}} {{cells from the}} circulation of melanoma patients, suggested that leucocyte-dependent antibody to melanoma cells may also be <b>blocked</b> by <b>factors</b> in their sera. The present study confirms these findings, by showing that most patients with disseminated melanoma had melanoma LDA activity in the IgG fraction when this was separated from their sera. This also applied to {{a high percentage of}} patients with primary melanoma. Evidence that the <b>blocking</b> <b>factors</b> may be immune complexes was shown by experiments in which LDA activity to melanoma cells was revealed after acidification of melanoma sera to dissociate immune complexes, followed by ultrafiltration through membranes retaining mole-cules of size greater than 100, 000 daltons. Blocking of LDA activity in the retentate recurred when the retentate was recombined with the filtrate. Further studies indicated that the blocking activity showed affinity for the target cell and not the effector cell. Preliminary analysis of the specificity of the blocking suggests that this was similar to that of melanoma antisera. These results appear to show that blocking of LDA activity to melanoma cells is common in melanoma patients and that the assay system may provide a quantitative method for their analysis that may yield information of biological importance in the management of melanoma patients. THE presence of <b>blocking</b> <b>factors</b> which inhibit cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) against tumour cells appears to provide one of the more important mechanisms for escape of tumours from the immune cytotoxic response of the host.

Since the <b>blocking</b> <b>factors</b> of macrophage migration inhibition were increasing on the 7 th day, that day was determined to be the optimal time of antigen pretreatment. The mean survival time (MST) of cardiac allografts in untreated rats was 17. 2 +/- 7. 5 days. Semisoluble antigens were administered at 2 mg/kg body weight 7 days before the graft, 4 mg/kg 7 days before the graft and 2 mg/kg divided over three days, 15, 8 and 1 day before the graft, and the MSTs of cardiac allografts of rats receiving these treatments were 71. 2 +/- 39. 9, 62. 6 +/- 42. 2 and 79. 3 +/- 31. 0 days, respectively.

He also identified geminin, a replication inhibitor, as a <b>blocking</b> <b>factor</b> of viral DNA replication, a discovery which earned him a US patent. Later, he studied the human pathogens, Helicobacter pylori and Plasmodium falciparum and their DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. He also worked on anti-malarial drugs and proposed Acriflavine as an anti-malarial agent, which has also been patented by him. His work has identified PfGyrase for P. falciparum and HpDnaB helicase for H. pylori as targets and these researches are reported to be helpful in drug discovery efforts for Gastric ulcers, Gastric adenocarcinomas and Malaria.Dhar has documented his research by way of a number of articles and online repositories such as PubMed and Pubfacts have listed many of them. He has contributed chapters to three books which include Epigenetics: Development and Disease by Tapas Kumar Kundu.
