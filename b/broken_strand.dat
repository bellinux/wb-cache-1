5000|$|The pathway of HDR has {{not been}} totally elucidated yet (March 2008). However, a number of {{experimental}} results point to the validity of certain models. It is generally accepted that histone H2AX (noted as γH2AX) is phosphorylated within seconds after damage occurs. H2AX is phosphorylated throughout the area surrounding the damage, not only precisely at the break. Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that γH2AX functions as an adhesive component for attracting proteins to the damaged location. Several research groups have suggested that the phosphorylation of H2AX is done by ATM and ATR in cooperation with MDC1. It has been suggested that before or while H2AX is involved with the repair pathway, the MRN complex (which consists of Mre11, Rad50 and NBS1) is attracted to the broken DNA ends and other MRN complexes to keep the broken ends together. This action by the MRN complex may prevent chromosomal breaks. At some later point the DNA ends are processed so that unnecessary residuals of chemical groups are removed and single strand overhangs are formed. Meanwhile, from the beginning, every piece of single stranded DNA is covered by the protein RPA (Replication Protein A). The function of RPA is likely to keep the single stranded DNA pieces stable until the complementary piece is resynthesized by a polymerase. After this, Rad51 replaces RPA and forms filaments on the DNA strand. Working together with BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Associated), RPA couples a complementary DNA piece which invades the broken DNA strand to form a template for the polymerase. The polymerase is held onto the DNA strand by PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen). PCNA forms typical patterns in the nucleus of the cell through which the current cell cycle can be determined. The polymerase synthesizes the missing part of the <b>broken</b> <b>strand.</b> When the <b>broken</b> <b>strand</b> is rebuilt, both strands need to uncouple again. Multiple ways of [...] "uncoupling" [...] have been suggested, but evidence is not yet sufficient to choose between models (March 2008). After the strands are separated the process is done.The co-localization of Rad51 with the damage indicates that HDR has been initiated instead of NHEJ. In contrast, the presence of a Ku complex (Ku70 and Ku80) indicates that NHEJ has been initiated instead of HDR.HDR and NHEJ repair double strand breaks. Other mechanisms such as NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair), BER (Base Excision Repair) and MMR recognise lesions and replace them via single strand perturbation.|$|E

This paper presents a visual detection method for the <b>broken</b> <b>strand</b> fault. The <b>broken</b> <b>strand</b> fault can be detected by judging the intensity distribution of histogram of edge gradient(HOEG) in the following steps: at first, the region of interest (ROI) of captured images is selected; then, the HOEG descriptor is extracted in ROI as image feature; at last, the intensity distribution of HOEG descriptor can differentiate the <b>broken</b> <b>strand</b> fault from the normal wire.

40|$|Abstract—Aluminum {{conductor}} steel-reinforced (ACSR) {{cable is}} {{a specific type of}} stranded cable typically used for electrical power delivery. Steel strands in ACSR cable play a supportive role for overhead power line. Inspection timely is an important means to insure safety operation of power lines. As steel strands are wrapped in the center of ACSR cable, the common artificial inspection methods with optical instruments are limited to find inner flaws of power line. Recently, inspection of power line by robot with detectors is a method with good prospect.

40|$|During the strand-exchange {{events of}} {{bacteriophage}} lambda integration, pairs of phosphodiester bonds are broken and then rejoined to form novel DNA linkages. The reaction proceeds in vitro {{in the absence}} of an external energy source; the bond energy needed to rejoin <b>broken</b> <b>strands</b> of DNA must therefore be conserved during cleavage. Although some of this conservation involves a covalent intermediate between DNA and the recombinase Int, it is possible that such an intermediate is formed with only one of the two phosphodiesters. In such an asymmetric mechanism, the second phosphodiester would be attacked by a nucleophile that is exposed by cleavage of the first DNA strand. In contrast, a symmetric mechanism hypothesizes nucleophilic attack by Int on both phosphodiesters. We have distinguished these two mechanisms by removing potential nucleophiles from the integrative recombination reaction. Our data are inconsistent with an asymmetric mechanism. We conclude that during strand exchange both phosphodiesters proceed through a covalent protein-DNA intermediate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Early defect {{detection}} and monitoring of rope systems constitute important safety requirements for equipment that employs ropes as single driving component, e. g. lifts, rope trains, etc. Quality characteristics of ropes are regulated by procedures of safety standards and are prescribed in safety standards of transportation machines, which are particularly stringent {{in the case}} of human elevating equipment. Many types of rope quality control are applied in practice but standard control procedure of such nonhomogeneous structures as ropes with electromagnetic methods are still not fully reliable, particularly {{in the case of}} broken wires in rope strands. The paper presents a method for detection of the aforementioned rope defects using dynamic properties of a rope that is treated as a dynamic system. The proposed method enables to measure dynamic characteristics of a rope system and, based on obtained results, evaluate rope quality, determine the presence of broken strands and define cross-section of the defects. Analysis of dynamic properties is used in order to establish existence of a defect. Aim of such analysis is to determine some characteristic natural frequencies corresponding to <b>broken</b> <b>strand</b> and change of the lowest natural frequencies that represent the rope as a constrained system. The paper also addresses the issues of equipment and methodology required for defect detection in ropes together with the necessary conditions.

40|$|Cells use Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) {{to repair}} double stranded DNA breaks. When {{there is a}} double stranded break in the DNA, rather than reattaching the broken pieces of DNA, the cell will compare the <b>broken</b> <b>strand</b> to the homologous copy of DNA {{and use it as}} a template to complete repair. A protein called Rad 51 is the central engine for HR and forms a filament on DNA to promote HR. But, too much HR is also bad for the cell as it will cause chromosome rearrangements. The cells control when and where Rad 51 functions by removing it from unwanted places in the DNA. This is accomplished by a protein called Srs 2. Srs 2 moves along the DNA and remove Rad 51, a role analogous to a wire stripper. My research seeks to understand the dynamics of Srs 2 and Rad 51 so as to better understand their roles in DNA repair. We have uncovered the speed of Srs 2 movement on the DNA and how much ATP is used in the movement. This study gives a quantitative measure of Srs 2 sliding, forward 2 ̆ 6 backward movement and pausing while moving along the DNA. Using this information, we will put together a mechanism for Srs 2 movement on DNA as it works to remove the Rad 51 filament on DNA. Ultimately, this helps us understand why mutations in protein like Srs 2 and Rad 51 lead to the onset of cancer...|$|E
