Males {{of some of the most}} long-lived species of fruit-feeding butterflies were collected from Kibale Forest, Uganda, and kept on diets of either sugar or <b>mashed</b> <b>banana.</b> Seven out of eight species had non-significantly longer life spans on <b>mashed</b> <b>banana</b> diets. Data analysis using a time-varying Cox-model with species as covariate showed that males had reduced survival on the sugar diet during the first 35 days of captive life, but the effect was absent or reversed at more advanced ages. These results challenge the generality of dietary restriction as a way to extend life span in animals. We argue that such studies on males are promising tools for better understanding life history evolution and aging because males display a wider variety of tactics for obtaining reproductive success than females...|$|R

40|$|Vomiting after feeding is {{a symptom}} of {{gastroesophageal}} reflux (GER) and of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), which are considered to be a cause of infant feeding disorder. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate swallowing in children with feeding disorder manifested by vomiting after feeding. Using clinical and videofluoroscopic methods we studied the swallowing of 37 children with vomiting after feeding (mean age = 15. 4 months), and of 15 healthy children (mean age = 20. 5 months). In the videofluoroscopic examination the children swallowed a free volume of milk and 5 ml of <b>mashed</b> <b>banana,</b> both mixed with barium sulfate. We evaluated five swallows of liquid and five swallows of paste. The videofluoroscopic examination was recorded at 60 frames/s. Patients had difficulty during feeding, pneumonia, respiratory distress, otitis, and irritability more frequently than controls. During feeding, children with vomiting, choke were irritable, and refused food more frequently than controls, and during the videofluoroscopic examination the patients had more backward movement of the head than controls for both the liquid and paste boluses. There was no difference in the timing of oral swallowing transit, pharyngeal swallowing transit, or pharyngeal clearance between patients and controls. We conclude that children with vomiting after feeding may have difficulties in accepting feeding, although they have no alteration of oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing...|$|R
