The small, outlying islands off Tahiti also have rats, though there were no cats on Mehetia {{at the time of}} Greenway's writing in 1967. According to Bruner, the bird was said to have been common on Tahiti {{until the end of the}} 19th century, beginning to decline thereafter; it had disappeared from there sometime after 1844. It may have survived on the smaller, uninhabited island of Mehetia until the 1930s, perhaps due to the absence of cats. This later date is accepted by the IUCN Red List. Other extinct Tahitian birds include the Tahiti sandpiper and the <b>black-fronted</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and some species have disappeared from Tahiti itself but survive on other islands. According to Olson, it is possible that hundreds of rail populations have become extinct from islands following the arrival of humans within the past 1500 years.|$|E
5000|$|The extinct <b>black-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> or Tahiti parakeet (Cyanoramphus zealandicus) was {{endemic to}} the Pacific island of Tahiti. Its native name was simply ’ā’ā ("parrot") {{according}} to Latham (1790) though White (1887) gives [...] "aa-maha".|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} species of birds the Cyanoramphus parakeets have {{suffered}} from changes brought about by humans. The two species from the Society Islands, the <b>black-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> and the Society parakeet, have become extinct as have the subspecies from Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island, {{as well as an}} undescribed form from Campbell Island. One species, the Malherbe's parakeet (C. malherbi), is critically endangered while most other species are endangered or vulnerable. Habitat loss and introduced species are considered responsible for the declines and extinctions.|$|E
5000|$|Like its relative, the Society parakeet, {{the species}} {{inhabited}} woodlands, but as testified by the 1773 report of Georg Forster, {{they were able}} to persist in numbers despite widespread deforestation for agriculture and the presence of the small kiore rats and pigs, which undoubtedly preyed on the bird's eggs on occasion. The natives of Tahiti, who valued red parrot feathers for use in handicraft above all others, had to trade for these with the Samoans, as the <b>black-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> did not possess the desired feathers in sufficient quality and quantity. However, they liked to keep the species as pets. After the introduction of cats and European rats, the species rapidly succumbed to these predators.|$|E
