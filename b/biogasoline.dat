In addition, environmental groups may demand that <b>biogasoline</b> that is produced {{in a way that}} protects wildlife, especially fish. [...] A research group studying the economic viability of biofuels found that current techniques of production and high costs of production will prevent <b>biogasoline</b> from being accessible to the general public. [...] The group determined that the price of <b>biogasoline</b> would need to be approximately $800 per barrel, which they determine as unlikely with current production costs. Another problem inhibiting the success of <b>biogasoline</b> is the lack of tax relief. The government is providing tax relief for ethanol fuels but has yet to offer tax relief for <b>biogasoline.</b> This makes <b>biogasoline</b> a much less attractive option to consumers. Lastly, producing <b>biogasoline</b> could have a large effect on the farming industry. If <b>biogasoline</b> became a serious alternative, a large percentage of our existing arable land would be converted to grow crops solely for <b>biogasoline.</b> This could decrease the amount of land used to farm food for human consumption and may decrease overall feedstock.

40|$|The kinetic {{modeling}} of the pyrolysis and combustion of liquid transportation fuels {{is a very}} complex task for two different reasons: the challenging characterization of the complex mixture of several hydrocarbon isomers and the complexity of the oxidation mechanisms of large hydrocarbon and oxygenated molecules. While surrogate mixtures of reference components allow to tackle the first difficulty, the complex behavior of the oxidation mechanisms is mostly overcome by reducing the total number of involved species by adopting a lumping approach. After a first investigation of the different liquid fuels (gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuels), a short discussion on the lumping techniques allows to highlight the advantages of this approach. The lumped POLIMI pyrolysis and oxidation mechanism of hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuels is then used for generating several skeletal mechanisms for typical surrogate mixtures, moving from pure n-heptane up to heavy diesel fuels. These skeletal models are simply reduced with a reaction flux analysis, and they involve between 100 and 200 species. While these sizes already allow detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations in internal combustion engines, further reduction phases are necessary when the interest is toward more complex CFD computations. To maintain the standard structure of the skeletal mechanisms, successive reduction phases are not considered. Moreover, new regulations pushed toward a greater use of renewable fuels. For these reasons, the skeletal models are also extended to <b>biogasolines</b> including methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol. Similarly, skeletal models of diesel and biodiesel fuels, including methyl esters, are also provided. Several comparisons with experimental data and complete validations in the operating range of internal combustion engines are also reported.

40|$|Biofuels {{produced}} from palm oil have shown great {{potential as a}} useful fossil fuel substitute and are environmental friendly. Utilization of palm oil as biofuel requires zeolite based catalytic technology that facilitates selective conversion of substrates to desired products, including <b>biogasoline</b> and biodiesel. However, the synthesis and integration of suitable zeolite based supported catalysts for the desired products are the key challenges in biofuel production. The alternative {{to overcome these problems}} is to use nano heterometallic materials supported on zeolite catalysts. In this study, Zeolite Socony Mobile- 5 (ZSM- 5) based catalysts loaded with heterometallic nano oxides were synthesized. Next, the catalysts used for the palm oil cracking to produce <b>biogasoline</b> were characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) analysis.

The catalytic cracking results illustrated that under optimized conditions, ZSM- 5 (30), Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM- 5 (31), Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM- 5 (32) and Fe-Zn-ZSM- 5 (33) yielded 14 %, 59 %, 49 % and 56 % <b>biogasoline,</b> respectively.

The reaction temperatures were 300 °C and 320 °C, while the reaction time were 1, 1. 5 and 2 h for each temperature. A common simultaneous cracking and hydrogenation catalyst NiMo/zeolite (klinoptilolite type) was used with the catalyst/reactant weight ratio 1 : 75. The support of the catalyst was prepared by an ion exchange method using NH 4 NO 3 aqueous solution. While the metals were impregnated using Ni (NO 3) 2 and (NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24 solutions as the metal sources, respectively. The decreasing density and boiling point of palm oil before and after reaction began have proven that a part of the triglyceride molecules in the palm oil were cracked to become smaller molecules.

40|$|Heterometallic {{catalysts}} {{are important}} in large-scale industrial production of green fuels, chemicals and industrial effluent treatment. The efficiency of a heterometallic catalyst {{is dependent on the}} molecular homogeneity, surface-morphological properties and metal compositions. These features are being enhanced with recent developments in nanotechnology. Currently, several chemical methods are available and more methods are being developed or modified to synthesize nano heterometallic catalysts. However, obtaining the required features remains a challenging task as the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles differ significantly when used in bulk. To overcome this challenge, several researchers have developed nano-size heterometallic catalysts via Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) methods. In these methods, metals are attached to a suitable organic framework (ligand). However, these methods are not suitable for the synthesis {{of a wide range of}} heterometallic catalysts as each of these methods only produces a specific type of catalyst, which limits their use for industrial applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a suitable method that can formulate a wide range of nano-size heterometallic catalysts for industrial processes. In this work, a two-step chemical process was developed and used to synthesize nano-size heterometallic catalysts. In the first step, precipitation method was effectively employed to produce monometallic and polymetallic complexes. 2, 2 '-bipyridine was used as the ligand to interlink metal atoms (Ni, Zn, Fe, Cu and Al). In the second stage, heterometallic complexes were thermally decomposed to produce nano oxide clusters. The crystalline products were characterized for particle size, structure, morphology, surface area and thermogravimetric property. The two-step process was found to greatly improve the size, morphology and yields of the crystalline materials. The yield of Ni, Zn and Al clusters were 81 %, 80 % and 78 % respectively, while the yield of Ni-Zn, Zn-Al and Ni-Zn-Al complexes were 85 %, 78. 5 % and 77 % respectively. The two-step process was further utilized to produce supported type catalyst where Fe-ZSM- 5, Fe-Zn-ZSM- 5, and Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM- 5 heterogeneous catalysts were produced. Subsequently, the catalysts were used to treat wastewater containing organic recalcitrant contaminants (through Fenton oxidation process) and to produce <b>biogasoline</b> from palm oil. In the Fenton oxidation process, about 99 % of color removal and 77 % of total organic content (TOC) reduction were obtained. These values were significantly higher than the reported values in literature. When the same catalyst was used in the production of bio gasoline, the yield was about 56 %, which was almost more than 8 % compared to the literature values. The leaching analysis of the catalyst for the Fenton oxidation process revealed that only less than 2 ppm of the metals were leached after a single use, which was in the permissible range as a heterometallic catalyst. Therefore, the present study proved that the newly developed two-step process was efficient and economical to produce heterometallic catalysts, which have a great potential for wastewater treatments and green energy applications due to higher degree of uniformity. In addition, availability of ligand (2, 2 '-bipyridine), solvents (ethanol, 2 -proapnol and DMF) and their relevant information in the literature makes this 2 -step process an attractive process for the production of a variety of heterometallic catalysts...|$|E
