40|$|The tumor-producing and skin-irritating {{activity}} of the anti-psoriatic drug dithranol and its 10 -acyl analogues <b>butantrone</b> (10 -butyryl dithranol), 10 -isobutyryl dithranol and 10 -valeryl dithranol were studied in 650 SENCAR mice using a two-stage skin carcinogenesis assay. An initiation with 20 /ig of 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) was followed 2 weeks later by three applications per week of the test com-pounds in 50 /d of acetone for 21 weeks. In addition the com-pounds were studied without DMBA pre-treatment using application periods of 21 and 36 weeks. The concentration of dithranol was the maximum tolerated, 3. 5 mM. For the less irritating 10 -acyl analogues 30 mM solutions were used. The first signs of skin irritation were observed after an appli-cation period of 1 - 2 weeks and the irritation continued {{to the end of}} the experiment in all groups except the acetone controls. Dithranol caused the most severe irritation although the differences between the groups were not pronounced. On histopathology, the majority of animals had hyperplasia and other inflammatory changes of the skin. The first papillomas appeared 8 - 11 weeks after initiation and the incidences of papillomas at the end of the experiment were 85 % (dithrano...|$|E
