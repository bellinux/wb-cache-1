5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and offshore drilling exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an offshore wind farm should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
5|$|Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is {{considered}} inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, {{the head of}} Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values. Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in {{the ground with the}} head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca.|$|E

5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe also declined the offer as he felt he did not deserve to hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to these feelings, Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker T to contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> the match. Joe defeated Booker T at the event to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> schools {{has been on}} the rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E
