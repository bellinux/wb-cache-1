5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, <b>barnacle</b> <b>goose</b> and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the <b>barnacle</b> <b>goose</b> was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{research}} on migrating bird species. Two model species for migrating birds are the <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> (Branta leucopsis) and the Brent geese (Branta bernicla). A lot is known about their foraging, migrating and breeding behavior. Most studies focused only on a specific interaction during a specific time of the year. By putting all this information of different interactions and different areas together it is possible to make an interaction network for the whole flyway route of the geese. Brent geese are declining in numbers, while <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> numbers are growing. Because habitats are overlapping, it could be that, due to competition, the <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> have a share in the decline of the Brent geese. By comparing the interaction network of <b>Barnacle</b> and Brent <b>geese</b> it is possible to gain an insight into interactions between the two species. The analysis of the flyway route of the <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> shows that they only share the Wadden Sea wintering area with the Brent geese. It could be possible that the <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese,</b> which are bigger and in increasing numbers, are “pushing” the Brent geese from their foraging areas. However, the Brent geese were already declining before the Barnacle arrived in the Wadden Sea area. At the moment it seems that the increasing <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> numbers do not have a direct effect on the numbers of Brent geese. ...|$|R

500|$|Although less prestigious {{than other}} animal meats, and {{often seen as}} merely an {{alternative}} to meat on fast days, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. [...] "Fish" [...] to the medieval person was also a general name for anything not considered a proper land-living animal, including marine mammals such as whales and porpoises. Also included were the beaver, due to its scaly tail and considerable time spent in water, and barnacle geese, due {{to the belief that}} they developed underwater in the form of barnacles. Such foods were also considered appropriate for fast days, though rather contrived classification of barnacle geese as fish was not universally accepted. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird-like embryo in them, and the secretary of Leo of Rozmital wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served <b>barnacle</b> <b>goose</b> at a fish-day dinner in 1456.|$|E

40|$|Arctic {{breeding}} <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> use brackish marshes {{along the}} coastline of the Baltic Sea intensively in spring, during short stopovers on their migration to breeding sites in northern Russia. We mapped the vegetation of one important spring staging and brood rearing {{site on the}} Swedish island of Gotland and investigated the habitat use of <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese.</b> The geese mainly use plant communities with a high cover of edible species and a low canopy height. These vegetation characteristics are best maintained through livestock grazing {{and the maintenance of}} current grazing practices will be responsible for future site use by small herbivores. ...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{duration}} of parental care {{is shaped by}} the trade-off between investment in current and expected future reproductive success. A change in migratory behaviour is expected to affect the optimal {{duration of}} parental care, because migration and non-migration differ in expectations of future reproductive success {{as a result of}} differential adult and/or offspring mortality. Here we studied how a recent emergence of non-migratory behaviour has affected the duration of parental care in the previously (until the 1980 s) strictly migratory Russian breeding population of the <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> Branta leucopsis. As a measure of parental care, we compared the vigilance behaviour of parents and non-parents in both migratory and non-migratory <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> throughout the season. We estimated the duration of parental care at 233 days for migratory and 183 days for non-migratory <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese.</b> This constitutes a shortening of the duration of parental care of 21 % in 25 years. <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> are thus able to rapidly adapt their parental care behaviour to ecological conditions associated with altered migratory behaviour. Our study demonstrates that a termination of migratory behaviour resulted in a drastic reduction in parental care and highlights the importance of studying the ecological and behavioural consequences of changes in migratory behaviour and the consequences of these changes for life-history evolutio...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{expedition}} to a barnacle-goose (Branta leucopsis) breeding area in Kolokolkova Bay, west of the lower Pechora delta in northern Russia, undertaken in July 2002. In total, 6 breeding colonies were found within the study area, harbouring 1, 324 nests. Mean clutch size was 2. 77 +/- 0. 10 but may have been underestimated because of nest predation. Nest predation was high and correlated with the density of breeding gulls, Larus. The 2002 season was relatively cold and peak hatch occurred late, on 14 July. More than 11, 000 <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> were found to moult in the area which, together with the large number of nests found, emphasises the importance of Kolokolkova Bay for <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese.</b> Adult <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> (341) were captured, marked and measured during their annual wing moult. Birds with broods started to moult approximately 2 weeks later than non- and failed breeders. Weight loss during moult was 3 times as rapid as reported for <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> breeding in the Baltic, and a large cost of reproduction seemed to exist in the form of reduced body weight at the onset of moult for birds leading broods.

40|$|In group-living species, {{decisions}} made by individuals may result in collective behaviours. A central question in understanding collective behaviours is how individual variation in phenotype affects collective behaviours. However, how the personality of individuals affects collective decisions in groups remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of boldness on the decision-making process in different-sized groups of <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese.</b> Naive <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese,</b> differing in boldness score, were introduced in a labyrinth in groups with either one or three informed demonstrators. The demonstrators possessed information about the route through the labyrinth. In pairs, the probability of choosing a route prior to the informed demonstrator increased with increasing boldness score: bolder individuals decided more often for themselves where to go compared with shyer individuals, whereas shyer individuals waited more often for the demonstrators to decide and followed this information. In groups of four individuals, however, there was no effect of boldness on decision-making, suggesting that individual differences were less important with increasing group size. Our experimental results show that personality is important in collective decisions in pairs of <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese,</b> and suggest that bolder individuals have a greater influence over the outcome of decisions in groups...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying a {{relationship}} between heart rate (fH) and rate of oxygen consumption (V̇O 2) allows the estimation of V̇O 2 from fH recordings in free-ranging birds. It has been proposed that this relationship may vary throughout an animal's annual cycle, due to changes in physiological status. <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese,</b> Branta leucopsis, provide an ideal model to test this hypothesis, as they exhibit significant intra-annual variability in body mass, body composition and abdominal temperature, even in captivity. Heart rate data loggers were implanted in 14 captive <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese,</b> and at six points in the year the relationship between fH and V̇O 2 was determined. The fH/V̇O 2 relationship was also determined in seven moulting wild <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> to examine whether relationships from captive animals might be applicable to wild animals. In captive <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese,</b> the fH/V̇O 2 relationship was significantly different only between two out of the six periods when the relationship was determined (late September–early October and November). Accounting for changes in physiological parameters such as body mass, body composition and abdominal temperature did not eliminate this difference. The relationship between fH and V̇O 2 obtained from wild geese was significantly different {{from all of the}} relationships derived from the captive geese, suggesting that {{it is not possible to}} apply calibrations from captive birds to wild geese. However, the similarity of the fH and V̇O 2 relationship derived during moult in the captive geese to those during the remainder of the annual cycle implies it is not unreasonable to assume that the relationship between fH/V̇O 2 during moult in the wild geese is indicative of the relationship throughout the remainder of the annual cycle.

40|$|Little {{is known}} of natural {{variation}} in the innate immune system of wild animals. Therefore we investigated if birds alter their innate immune system during demanding periods (e. g. moult) or changing environment (e. g. reduced pathogen loads) for the individual. For this purpose, blood was sampled of juvenile and adult wild <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> during the breeding season on Spitsbergen, and {{tested for the ability}} to kill three different pathogens in vitro. <b>Barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> varied in their ability to kill the three pathogens but within individuals the killing of the different pathogens was not correlated. Goslings killed less Candida albicans than adults but did equal on killing Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Goslings increased their killing ability only for E. coli during growth. For adults the response decreased with moult progress for S. aureus and E. coli but not for C. albicans. Adult females were better in killing the S. aureus than males during moult. Thus <b>barnacle</b> <b>geese</b> varied in their innate immune system with the different life stages. Birds may adapt their innate immune system according to changes in pathogen pressure and/or birds could have been allocating energy and nutrients away from the innate immune system to compensate for energy and nutrient demands of moult and growth. This suggests that the geese regulate and redistribute their uS to keep the immune system working at the lowest possible cost. ...|$|R
