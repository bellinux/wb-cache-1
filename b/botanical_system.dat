Published information on it is scattered throughout the literature, in heterogeneous data formats, and is scattered among various Aboriginal communities across Australia, due to a multiplicity of languages. This ancient knowledge is at risk due to loss of biodiversity, cultural impact and the demise of many of its custodians. We have developed the Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb), an integrated multidisciplinary resource, to document, conserve and disseminate this knowledge. Description CMKb is an online relational database for collating, disseminating, visualising and analysing initially public domain data on customary medicinal plants. The database stores information related to taxonomy, phytochemistry, biogeography, biological activities of customary medicinal plant species as well as images of individual species. The database can be accessed at [URL]. Known bioactive molecules are characterized within the chemoinformatics module of CMKb, with functions available for molecular editing and visualization. Conclusion CMKb has been developed as a prototype data resource for documenting, integrating, disseminating, analysing multidisciplinary customary medicinal plant data from Australia and to facilitate user-defined complex querying. Each species in CMKb is linked to online resources such as the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), NCBI Taxonomy, Australia's SpeciesLinks-Integrated <b>Botanical</b> Information <b>System</b> (IBIS) and Google images.

Here we review some of the recent successes relating mainly to tree seed biology that have resulted in the development and application of innovative actions across five areas: (i) the expansion of living collections to conserve threatened tree species in sufficient numbers to ensure a broad genetic diversity in their progeny; (ii) the generation of viability constants to enable estimates to be made of storage longevity of tree seeds in the dry state; (iii) improvement in the diagnosis of tree seed storage behaviour through the development of predictive models, reliable prognoses of desiccation tolerance and use of <b>botanical</b> information <b>systems,</b> such as GIS, to correlate information on species distribution and their physiological characteristics; (iv) advances in storage preservation biotechnology to enhance the future application of cryopreservation procedures to recalcitrant species in biodiversity hotspots where many are under threat of extinction; and (v) integration of ex situ and in situ conservation approaches to ensure that best practice in horticultural and forestry are combined to maintain or enhance genetic diversity, especially in high value species and those with small and vulnerable populations. These actions can lead to greater impact if supported by greater efforts to create seed banks and to collate databases world-wide so that data, knowledge and collections are more available to the scientific, forestry and NGO communities. Throughout this review we have used examples from the mega-biodiversity countries of Brazil and China, as a way of illustrating wider principles that can be applied in many countries.

40|$|Cowpea Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. is an {{important}} component in mixed cropping systems that are appropriate to the agro-ecological characteristics of the West African savannah. However, the contribution of cowpea to overall productivity of the systems is reduced by a number of insect pest species. Compared with the humid zone, important features of insect pests in the savannah region include: (i) a tendency towards higher pest incidence during the limited growing period, (ii) a more advantageous situation for generalist and migratory pests in the scanty and unstable vegetation and (iii) lower mortality inflicted by parasitoids on the pest populations. The key pests of cowpea of importance in the West African savannah are the legume flower thrips Megalurothrips sjostedti (Trybom) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), the legume pod borer Maruca vitrata (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and the pod-sucking bug Clavigralla tomentosicollis Sta˚l (Hemiptera: Coreidae).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the application {{and testing of}} a method for deriving spatial estimates of albedo from multi-angle remote sensing data. Linear kernel-driven models of surface bi-directional reflectance have been inverted against high spatial resolution multi-angular, multi- spectral airborne data of the principal cover types within the HAPEX-Sahel study site in Niger, West Africa. The airborne data are obtained from the NASA Airborne Solid-state Imaging Spectrometer (ASAS) instrument, flown in Niger in September and October 1992. The maps of model parameters produced are used to estimate integrated reflectance properties related to spectral albedo. Broadband albedo has been estimated from this by weighting the spectral albedo for each pixel within the map {{as a function of}} the appropriate spectral solar irradiance and proportion of direct and diffuse illumination. Partial validation of the results was performed by comparing ASAS reflectance and derived directional-hemispherical reflectance with simulations of a millet canopy made with a complex geometric canopy reflectance model, the <b>Botanical</b> Plant Modelling <b>System</b> (BPMS). Both were found to agree well in magnitude. Broadband albedo values derived from the ASAS data were compared with ground-based (point sample) albedo measurements and found to agree extremely well. These results indicate that the linear kernel-driven modelling approach, which is to be used operationally to produce global 16 day, 1 km albedo maps from forthcoming NASA Earth Observing System spaceborne data, is both sound and practical for the estimation of angle-integrated spectral reflectance quantities related to albedo.

The experiments also evaluated the filter at different airflow rates across the filter and different moisture content inside the growth media. Based on the experimental data, the clean air delivery rates (CADR) of the Biowall were quantified. The preliminary results showed that the Biowall removed up to 90 % of the introduced contaminants within two to three hours inside a sealed environmental chamber. This could potentially translate into energy savings on the ventilation systems up to 25 %. In addition to savings on ventilation, the Biowall could contribute in saving heating and cooling energy by reducing the air temperature during summer months, and reducing the air dryness during the winter months. Â Beyond these quantifiable benefits, a Biowall provides an intangible benefit by adding a pleasant natural aesthetic to a home...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the application {{and testing of}} a method for deriving spatial estimates of albedo from multi-angle remote sensing data. Linear kernel-driven models of surface bi-directional reflectance have been inverted against high spatial resolution multi-angular, multi- spectral airborne data of the principal cover types within the HAPEX-Sahel study site in Niger, West Africa. The airborne data are obtained from the NASA Airborne Solid-state Imaging Spectrometer (ASAS) instrument, flown in Niger in September and October 1992. The maps of model parameters produced are used to estimate integrated reflectance properties related to spectral albedo. Broadband albedo has been estimated from this by weighting the spectral albedo for each pixel within the map {{as a function of}} the appropriate spectral solar irradiance and proportion of direct and diffuse illumination. Partial validation of the results was performed by comparing ASAS reflectance and derived directional-hemispherical reflectance with simulations of a millet canopy made with a complex geometric canopy reflectance model, the <b>Botanical</b> Plant Modelling <b>System</b> (BPMS). Both were found to agree well in magnitude. Broadband albedo values derived from the ASAS data were compared with ground-based (point sample) albedo measurements and found to agree extremely well. These results indicate that the linear kernel-driven modelling approach, which is to be used operationally to produce global 16 day, 1 km albedo maps from forthcoming NASA Earth Observing System spaceborne data, is both sound and practical for the estimation of angle-integrated spectral reflectance quantities related to albedo. Results for broadband albedo are dependent on spectral sampling and on obtaining the correct spectral weigthings...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the larger}} {{estuaries}} along the South African coastline are highly degraded due to human impacts, highlighting the need to conserve pristine systems. There are approximately 100 micro-estuaries along our coastline which {{have not yet been}} identified or classified and hence their ecological functioning is unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and classify micro-estuaries along the Eastern Cape coast. Specific objectives of the study were to: 1) map the distribution of estuarine habitats in a selection of micro-estuaries and assess changes over time; 2) measure the physico-chemical characteristics of the micro-estuaries in the field; 3) investigate the distribution of vegetation, identify macrophyte species and habitat integrity and classify the micro-estuaries sampled using abiotic and botanical characteristics. A total of 30 systems were identified of which 10 were selected for sampling which took place seasonally (2015 - 2016). A relationship between open water surface area and short term rainfall was only evident in Cunge, Sandy Bottom and Ichabana. In the field it was observed that after heavy rainfall, open water surface area increased and mouth breaching occurred. Salinity was the only water column characteristic that showed differences; salinity increased in response to over wash events. Sand was dominant in all systems and there were no differences in sediment characteristics. A total of 8 macroalgal species, 16 estuarine macrophyte species, six freshwater species and 72 riparian plant species were found. Seed bank reserves were low in all systems despite them being vegetated. Only abiotic characteristics were used for classification using Principle Components Analysis since there were no <b>botanical</b> differences between <b>systems.</b> Micro-estuaries were larger (> 0. 03 ha), had a higher salinity (oligohaline, mesohaline and polyhaline conditions) and a constant water body. Micro-outlets were smaller (< 0. 03 ha), had a lower salinity (oligohaline conditions were most common) and showed periods of drying. Five micro-estuaries (Shelbertsstroom, Kwesani, Cunge, Mtwendwe and Mtendwe) and five micro-outlets (Stromatolite, Sandy Bottom, Ichabana, Palm Tree and Black Rock) were classified. This study has shown that the micro-estuaries along the Eastern Cape coast are pristine (i. e. intact riparian zone and catchment), untouched and highly dynamic systems (i. e. great variation in water surface area and mouth condition) highlighting their need for protection...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were to: (1) Develop a reliable, cost-effective, and production-friendly technique to apply the power-enhancing layer at the interface of the air electrode and electrolyte of the Siemens SOFC; (2) Design, build, install, and operate in the field two 5 kWe SOFC systems fabricated with the state-of-the-art cylindrical, tubular cell and bundle technology and incorporating advanced module design features. Siemens successfully demonstrated, first {{in a number of}} single cell tests and subsequently in a 48 -cell bundle test, a significant power enhancement by employing a power-enhancing composite interlayer at the interface between the air electrode and electrolyte. While successful from a cell power enhancement perspective, the interlayer application process was not suitable for mass manufacturing. The application process was of inconsistent quality, labor intensive, and did not have an acceptable yield. This program evaluated the technical feasibility of four interlayer application techniques. The candidate techniques were selected based on their potential to achieve the technical requirements of the interlayer, to minimize costs (both labor and material), and suitably for large-scale manufacturing. Preliminary screening, utilizing lessons learned in manufacturing tubular cells, narrowed the candidate processes to two, ink-roller coating (IRC) and dip coating (DC). Prototype fixtures were successfully built and utilized to further evaluate the two candidate processes for applying the interlayer to the high power density Delta 8 cell geometry. The electrical performance of interlayer cells manufactured via the candidate processes was validated. Dip coating was eventually selected as the application technique of choice for applying the interlayer to the high power Delta 8 cell. The technical readiness of the DC process and product quality was successfully and repeatedly demonstrated, and its throughput and cost are amenable to large scale manufacturing. Two 5 kWe-class SOFC power systems were built and installed for the purpose of testing and evaluating state-of-the-art tubular cell and bundle technologies, advanced generator and module design features, balance-of-plant components, and cost reduction measures. Installed at the Phipps Conservatory and <b>Botanical</b> Gardens, a <b>system</b> operated for more than 17, 500 hrs, delivering electrical power to the on-site grid and thermal energy in form of hot water for onsite utilization. Operation was typically autonomous, requiring minimal operator intervention, and achieved an overall availability of greater than 85 %. Outages were primarily due to an unstable local grid, two weather related outages were experienced, and very few reliability issues were encountered despite harsh operating conditions. No repairs to the stack, module, or balance-of-plant were required. A second system was designed, built, delivered, and installed at a Siemens facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. Operational issues associated with the balance-of-plant were encountered during startup and prevented the system from operating...|$|R
