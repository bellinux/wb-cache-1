Our love for Japanese anime, Hong Kong action and kung fu cinema, yoga, and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for Avatar: The Last Airbender." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Sednaoui. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took {{inspiration}} from Nobuyoshi Araki's work, {{and tried to}} convey a similar aesthetic to the photoshoot. The cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue Véronique Leroy mini dress. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album, Sednaoui had to photograph a separate artwork and dedicate it to those editions. The lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. In order to create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed himself in a black body suit so he couldn't {{be seen in the}} final shot. However, Minogue remarked that [...] "the shoot was so very difficult <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that once we got it right it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio. He {{found it difficult to}} write a complete song at home, and finished the lyrics later. Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start talking a lot of shit to us to let us feel like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> we got something right when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} look of Frozen, Giaimo began {{pre-production}} research by reading extensively about the entire region of Scandinavia and visiting the Danish-themed city of Solvang near Los Angeles, but eventually zeroed in on Norway in particular because [...] "80 percent" [...] of the visuals that appealed to him were from Norway. Disney eventually sponsored three research field trips. Animators and special effects specialists were dispatched to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to experience walking, running, and falling in deep snow {{in a variety of}} types of attire, including long skirts (which both female and male personnel tried on); while lighting and arts teams visited an Ice Hotel in Quebec City, Quebec to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice. Finally, Giaimo and several artists traveled to Norway to draw inspiration from its mountains, fjords, architecture, and culture. [...] "We had a very short time schedule for this film, so our main focus was really to get the story right <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that John Lasseter is keen on truth in the material and creating a believable world, and again that doesn't mean it's a realistic world– but a believable one. It was important to see the scope and scale of Norway, and important for our animators to know what it's like," [...] Del Vecho said. [...] "There is a real feeling of Lawrence of Arabia scope and scale to this," [...] he finished.|$|E

Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon {{the concept of the}} show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> what we are doing is different, but it comes straight from our heart." [...] He also added, [...] "I cannot say I understand TV completely.

2500|$|In 1990, the U.S. {{created a}} fourteen-member team whose members {{included}} {{representatives of the}} CIA, the U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Embassy's Military Group, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (produces intelligence for the United States Department of Defense). This was done {{in order to give}} advice on the reshaping of several of the Colombian military's local intelligence networks. The stated reason for this restructuring was to aid the Colombian military in their counter-narcotics efforts. Years later, Col. James S. Roach, Jr., who was the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) country liaison and U.S. Military Attache in Bogotá during the meetings, told Human Rights Watch (HRW) that: [...] "The intent [...] was not to be associated with paramilitaries. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> from Colombian news reports and [...] from Colombian military reports that they were still working with paramilitaries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Women in Revolt {{was first}} {{shown at the}} first Los Angeles Filmex as Sex. Later it was shown as Andy Warhol's Women, an homage to George Cukor. Unable to get a {{distributor}} for the film, Warhol rented out the Cine Malibu on East 59th Street and launched the film with a celebrity preview on February 16, 1972. After the screening there was a dinner in Darling's honor at Le Parc Périgord restaurant, on Park Avenue, followed by a party at Francesco Scavullo's townhouse, where they watched TV reviews of the movie, some of which called it [...] "a rip-off", and that it [...] "looked {{as if it were}} filmed underwater," [...] and [...] "proves once again that Andy Warhol has no talent. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that since the Campbell's Soup cans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bungie {{conceived}} of Soulblighter {{prior to the}} release of [...] in 1997, with the only thing that would prevent them from making it being if The Fallen Lords was a commercial failure. However, when the original game proved a success, becoming Bungie's biggest selling game thus far, the sequel immediately went into development. One of their main goals with the sequel was to include numerous gameplay aspects and game mechanics which they had wanted to feature in The Fallen Lords, but had been unable to implement due to time constraints. Alex Seropian, co-founder of Bungie, explains [...] "there were still some things at the end of Myth that we wanted to do, but we just ran out of time. Myth was a terrific product, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> we could do a lot better." [...] Of the initial planning for Soulblighter, Seropain states ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{band members}} had a mixed {{experience}} in Hamburg. Harrison later said that [...] "a lot of ghosts materialised {{out of the}} woodwork – people you didn't necessarily want to see again, who had been your best friend one drunken Preludin night back in 1960." [...] McCartney commented: [...] "It was as if we'd mutated into something different and yet we were still just the boys. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> and they knew that we'd got famous in the meantime …" [...] The Beatles had also tired of the generally inane questions put to them at press conferences throughout the German tour, with only McCartney attempting to humour the local reporters. At the between-shows press conference in Hamburg, Lennon's impatience was palpable, leading a female reporter to ask why the band had become [...] "so horrid and snobby". On 27 June, the Beatles and their entourage flew from Hamburg to London's Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight over the North Pole to Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|No {{conceptual}} {{music videos}} {{ended up being}} made to promote Invitation to the Dance, {{in part due to}} issues with the band's troubled label London-Sire. Despite being one of the heavier songs on the album, [...] "Falling Down" [...] received moderate airplay, leading to it initially being considered. Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away" [...] — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and we were about three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it {{and they were going to}} wait until early next year, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that they were folding.

2500|$|Ash's {{first episode}} as Vanessa was watched by 5.73 million viewers. It was {{selected}} as recommended viewing by the Daily Post and Daily Mirror, with The Mirror Jane Simon commenting: [...] "Ash looks terrific despite being lumbered with big owlish glasses just like the ones that Manda (Josie Lawrence) has to wear in EastEnders. This {{seems to be a}} new kind of wardrobe department shorthand for: 'You may remember me from shows that were popular in the 80s.'" [...] Asked whether he was happy with the reception she had received, Tony McHale told Inside Soap: [...] "I am, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that there would be the odd headline that would have a dig at certain things. Viewers seem to have taken to her, though, and enjoy what she's doing on the show. It was a good idea not to bring Leslie in as a goody two-shoes type, I think - Vanessa is a very complex character." [...] In November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticizing Holby City and its sister-show Casualty for misrepresenting real hospital life. Anne Pickles of the News and Star commented on the piece: [...] "Holby always was close in nature to a cheap airport paperback page-turner. But it has become even more so with the arrival of Leslie Ash, who actually has the same job as Antony Sumara – though it's doubtful he has her trout pout or stiff, barking old sergeant major demeanour." ...|$|E
