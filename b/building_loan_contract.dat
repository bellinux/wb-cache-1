40|$|This paper {{examines}} industry structure, {{corporate governance}} at firm-level and country-level, {{and the bank}} <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> terms by analysing 2, 689 companies from 23 countries during the period 2004 – 2008. We find that firms in less competitive industries, with better firm-level governance, or with better country-level governance borrow larger sized loans at lower interest rates without collateral requirements. However, the effect of monopoly power of market concentration on the <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> terms is adjusted by corporate governance mechanisms. By controlling for both firm-level and country-level governance, firms in competitive industries are found to have favored <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> terms.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>loan</b> <b>contracting</b> {{from a private}} bank in Vietnam. We focus on the main <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> {{features}} that the bank uses in lending to business firms, namely loan maturity, collateral and loan interest rate. Based upon the simultaneous equation model of Dennis et al. (2000) and the bank 2 ̆ 019 s <b>loan</b> <b>contracting</b> policies, we examine the possible interdependency of the three different <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> terms. Also, we try to determine which firm characteristics and exogenous factors are relevant for <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> We find strong interdependencies between these contract terms with significant bi-directional relationships between collateral and loan maturity, loan rate and loan maturity, and a uni-directional relationship between loan rate and collateral. The conflicting signs within the collateral 2 ̆ 013 loan maturity relationship and the loan interest rate 2 ̆ 013 loan maturity relationship {{can be explained by}} our hypothesis that the choice for a certain loan maturity is primarily determined by borrowers 2 ̆ 019 behaviors, whereas the loan rate and the collateral requirements are primarily determined by banks policies. In addition, our results support the relevance of firm quality, agency costs of debt and relationship lending in <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> design...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} empirically how bank regulations adopted in lender countries influence {{the characteristics of}} <b>loan</b> <b>contracts,</b> using a sample of 46, 453 loans made by 278 large commercial banks around 39 countries, to borrowers in 83 countries, in the period from 1998 to 2006. Our findings indicate that the stringency of capital regulations have an inverse U-shaped relationship with priced risk characteristics (spread and maturity) of <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> In addition, more powerful official supervision is associated with riskier <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> Both official supervisory power and private monitoring work as substitutes to capital regulation to reduce the (priced) risk measures of <b>loan</b> <b>contracts</b> when capital stringency is low. For higher capital stringency, supervision and private monitoring complement capital regulation in reducing <b>loan</b> <b>contracts</b> risk measures. Finally, we found that a country’s degrees of legal enforcement and bank industry competition complement capital and private monitoring regulations to improve risk characteristics of <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> The evidence {{highlights the importance of}} how bank lending practices are affected by bank regulations and their interactions with themselves and other institutional country factors.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} shareholder rights on non-price <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> terms. Using a large sample of syndicated loans borrowed by U.

The likelihood of having collateral significantly increases with the strength of shareholder rights. Loan maturity of firms with strongest shareholder rights is 13. 1 % shorter. The loan size of the same borrowing firms is 8. 4 % smaller. These results are robust to different proxies of shareholder rights and are robust to the instrumental variable approach controlling for simultaneous determination of <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> terms, such as collateral and maturity. This study complements the existing literature {{on the impact of}} shareholder rights on loan pricing and has important implications for understanding the impact of companies' governance structure on <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> design...|$|R
