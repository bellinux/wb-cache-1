5|$|Brian Griffin is {{a strict}} high school English teacher at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico who never accepts late {{homework}} and is demanding of his students. When Mark Kinney, {{one of the}} students in his class, plagiarizes a paper Mr. Griffin makes him beg to be allowed back into the class. However, instead of allowing him back in, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett, Betsy Cline, and Susan McConnell. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> he has treated them poorly.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked to}} comment on the {{departure}} of team members in August 2013, Carroll stated, [...] "When people quit for other companies for just more money, or something, that's stupid. But, if someone quits <b>because</b> <b>they</b> don't <b>feel</b> right on a team, or something, then, and for another company, that makes sense." ...|$|R
25|$|Employees {{develop and}} {{maintain}} various relationships within organizations. These relationships {{can influence the}} choices employees make about expressing dissent. Employees may feel uncomfortable voicing their dissenting opinions {{in the presence of}} others <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> the best way to preserve relationships is to keep quiet. Homogeneous groups also place pressure on individuals to conform. Since many people fear being embarrassed in front of their peers, they can easily be lulled into consensus (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Gender {{dysphoria}} {{or gender}} identity disorder (GID) {{occurs when the}} child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|E
25|$|Brewers {{have the}} option of using a liquid (LME) or dry (DME) form of it. Each has its pros and cons, so the choice is {{dependent}} solely on the individual brewer's preferences. Some brewers choose to work only with LME, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> it works best for the result they wish to achieve. Also, it requires one fewer processing step, so it is appealing to those favoring the purest form of product available. However, it is very sticky and, therefore, messier to work with and has a shorter shelf life, and some feel the results are just as good with DME.|$|E

5000|$|According to Johns, {{the plan}} is to make readers want to get the Super-titles <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would <b>feel</b> that [...] "you HAVE to read, that you WANT to read". Robinson also added that even though neither he nor Johns would be writing Supergirl, they still {{made it clear that they}} were still the {{advisers}} to the book's next ongoing writer, Sterling Gates.|$|R
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans do this <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> like they shouldn't change their appearance {{to embrace the}} culture. In some instances {{it can be seen}} as a racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|Shelter {{employees}} are sometimes {{at risk from}} violence perpetrated by the clients they are serving. In order to address problems faced by employees {{who are trying to}} help the homeless in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015. While many employees of shelters {{know that there is a}} risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that they are performing a public service akin to the police or firefighters.|$|E
25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> {{they will be}} more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|By {{setting a}} goal {{that is based on}} maximization, people may feel that there is a set level that the group needs to be achieved. <b>Because</b> of this, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> can work less hard for the overall desired effect.|$|R
50|$|The role of {{the leaders}} within the {{organization}} is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking. Experienced kaizen members at Toyota, for example, often bring up the concepts of Senpai, Kohai, and Sensei, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> strongly <b>feel</b> that transferring of Toyota culture down and across Toyota can only happen when more experienced Toyota Sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions.|$|R
5000|$|He {{suggested}} that human misbehavior {{is the result}} of feeling a lack of belonging to one's social group. When this happens the child acts from one of four [...] "mistaken goals": undue attention, power, revenge or avoidance (inadequacy). His overall goal was that students would learn to cooperate reasonably without being penalized or rewarded <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> are valuable contributors to the classroom.|$|R
25|$|This battle {{would become}} {{extremely}} important to the Shi'i psyche. The Twelvers as well as Mustaali Ismāʿīlī still mourn this event during an occasion known as Ashura. The Nizari Ismāʿīlī, however, do not mourn this {{in the same way}} because of the belief that the light of the Imām never dies but rather passes on to the succeeding Imām, making mourning arbitrary. However, during commemoration they do not have any celebrations in Jamatkhana during Muharram and may have announcements or sessions regarding the tragic events of Karbala. Also individuals may observe Muharram {{in a wide variety of}} ways. This respect for Muharram does not include self-flagellation and beating <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that harming one's body is harming a gift from Allah.|$|E
25|$|More {{and more}} {{designers}} have shown inter-seasonal collections between the traditional Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer seasons. These collections are usually more commercial than the main season collections and help shorten the customer's wait for new season clothes. The inter-seasonal collections are Resort/Cruise (before Spring/Summer) and Pre-Fall (before Autumn/Winter). There is no fixed schedule for these shows {{in any of}} the major fashion capitals but they typically happen three months after the main season shows. Some designers show their inter-seasonal collections outside their home city. For example, Karl Lagerfeld has shown his Resort and Pre-Fall collections for Chanel in cities such as Moscow, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo instead of Paris. Many designers also put on presentations as opposed to traditional shows during Resort and Pre-Fall either to cut down costs or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> the clothes can be better understood in this medium.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{can lead}} to {{increased}} trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents {{to send their children}} to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> that this is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.|$|E

50|$|Police {{departments}} are another state institution that treats domestic violence differently than {{other forms of}} violence. Police often label domestic abuse calls as low priority, respond slower, and focus on what provoked the abuse rather than the violent actions of the perpetrator (Schelong, 1994). Also, they often act as mediators in the situation <b>because</b> <b>they</b> may <b>feel</b> that domestic violence is a family matter and therefore not their business (Schelong, 1994).|$|R
500|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party is {{attended}} by {{people from a}} wide variety of backgrounds and ages, some of whom may have been attending for decades. Austin's hippie community still puts in a major appearance at the event, which they celebrate by forming large drum circles which can sometimes contain hundreds of drummers and dancers in the large areas of the park not occupied by other events. [...] Members of the Deaf community like the drum circles <b>because</b> <b>they</b> can <b>feel</b> the vibrations.|$|R
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Americans United for Separation of Church and State launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the American Jewish Congress), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider culture war between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the Liberty Counsel, have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the U.S. Supreme Court {{as a threat to the}} expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E
