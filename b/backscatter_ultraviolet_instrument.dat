The SSBUV instrument operated since {{the first day of}} the flight, and plans were made by its ground controllers on Flight Day 4 to attempt to detect sulfur dioxide emissions from volcanoes in Central America. The objective of the observations by SSBUV were to investigate whether such emissions low in the atmosphere were detectable from orbit.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that during a solar proton event (SPE), large numbers of high-energy protons {{penetrate}} the earth's mesosphere and upper stratosphere and perturb the normal chemistry by ionizing molecules and changing the balance of odd nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. Changes in ozone caused by an SPE are produced very rapidly, typically {{in a matter of}} hours, and are confined to a limited geographic area, the region above 60 deg geomagnetic latitude. In this paper, an analysis is reported of the response of ozone to the significant SPE's in solar cycle 21 from the Nimbus 7 launch in October 1978 to date, using data from the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> (SBUV).

During the SPE on July 13, 1982, the largest of this solar cycle, no depletion at all at 45 km is observed, {{but there is a}} 15 percent ozone depletion at 50 km increasing to 27 percent at 55 km, all at a solar zenith angle of 85 deg. A strong variation of the observed depletion with solar zenith angle is found, with maximum depletion occurring at the largest zenith angles (near 85 deg) decreasing to near zero for angles below about 70 deg.

40|$|Following {{the solar}} proton event (SPE) of July 13, 1982, an {{increase}} in the strength of nitric oxide Gamma bands was observed in spectral scans of the atmospheric albedo made by the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> on Nimbus 7. Analysis of the (10), (01), and (02) Gamma band strengths allow an estimate to be made of the cumulative amount of nitric oxide above an altitude of 50 km. An increase in nitric oxide in southern hemisphere high latitudes following the SPE amounting to about 5 x 10 to the 14 th molecules per sq cm above an altitude of approximately 50 km is observed. The observed increase persists until the middle of September. A similar increase is not observed in the northern hemisphere, indicating that under summer conditions the mesospheric/thermospheric NO distribution returns to normal within {{a few days after the}} end of an SPE...|$|R

The selected system which optimally met the performance requirements for a shuttle based instrument was a pushbroom spatial scanner using a 15 element photomultiplier tube array and a Hadamard multiplex spectral scan.

40|$|Significant in-band {{stray light}} (IBSL) error at solar zenith angle (SZA) values larger than 77 ° near sunset in 4 SBUV/ 2 (Solar <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet)</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{on board the}} NOAA- 14, 17, 18 and 19 satellites, has been characterized. The IBSL error is caused by large surface {{reflection}} and scattering of the air-gapped depolarizer {{in front of the}} instrument's monochromator aperture. The source of the IBSL error is direct solar illumination of instrument components near the aperture rather than from earth shine. The IBSL contamination at 273 nm can reach 40 % of earth radiance near sunset, which results in as much as a 50 % error in the retrieved ozone from the upper stratosphere. We have analyzed SBUV/ 2 albedo measurements on both the dayside and nightside to develop an empirical model for the IBSL error. This error has been corrected in the V 8. 6 SBUV/ 2 ozone retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Absorption bands between 300 nm and 315 nm were {{observed}} in spectral scans of the atmospheric albedo made by the solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> (SBUV) on Nimbus 7 following the eruption of El Chichon. It is shown that these bands coincide with peaks in the absorption coefficient spectrum of SO 2 and use {{the magnitude of the}} absorption to estimate the column content of SO 2 present. A maximum concentration of 15 matm-cm of SO 2 was observed west of Hawaii on April 15; the minimum detectable amount of SO 2 in a single scan is about 1 matm-cm. The disappearance of the band structure at wavelengths below 300 nm indicates that the SO 2 was between 20 km and 30 km altitude. An excess albedo was also observed near 300 nm which was attributed to increased scattering from volcanic aerosols; the wavelength of the scattering feature indicates that the aerosols also were near 25 km altitude...|$|R
40|$|The Cloud Slicing {{technique}} {{has emerged as}} a powerful tool for the study of ozone in the upper troposphere. In this technique one looks at the variation with cloud height of the above-cloud column ozone derived from the <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instruments,</b> such as TOMS, to determine the ozone mixing ratio. For this technique to work properly one needs an instrument with relatively good horizontal resolution with very good signal to noise in measuring above-cloud column ozone. In addition, one needs the (radiatively) effective cloud pressure rather than the cloud-top pressure, for the ultraviolet photons received by a satellite instrument are scattered from inside the cloud rather than from the top. For this study we use data from the OMI sensor, which was recently launched on the EOS Aura satellite. OMI is a W-Visible backscattering instrument with a nadir pixel size of 13 x 24 km. The effective cloud pressure is derived from a new algorithm based on Rotational Raman Scattering and O 2 -O 2, absorption in the 340 - 400 nm band of OMI...|$|R

These provide global measurements of ozone from November 1978 to the present which confirm the reported decline in total ozone in the Antarctic region and show the phenomenon to be regional in extent. The decrease occurs during September as the sun rises, reaching a minimum in mid-October. Seven years (1979 - 1985) of October monthly means show a 40 percent decrease in the ozone minimum and a 20 percent decrease in the surrounding ozone maximum...|$|E

Analyses are conducted based on area-weighted zonal means for 0 – 30 ° S, 0 – 30 ° N, 50 – 30 ° S, and 30 – 60 ° N.

40|$|Satellite-borne {{instruments}} (the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer and the Solar <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>Instrument)</b> show that, {{compared to}} 1979, total column ozone has a year-round decrease {{of more than}} 5 percent {{in the neighborhood of}} 60 deg S. The meteorological conditions (warmer temperatures, the absence of polar stratospheric clouds) at these latitudes do not seem to favor heterogeneous chemistry as the direct cause for the observed year-round ozone reduction. A mechanism involving the seasonal transport of ozone-poor air from within the polar vortex to lower latitudes (the so-called 'dilution effect') is proposed as a possible explanation for the observed year-round ozone reduction in subpolar regions. A two-dimensional model with an imposed springtime Antarctic ozone depletion is used to study the post-ozone hole impact on the spatial and temporal distributions of column ozone at latitudes north of 60 deg S. It is found that the time constant associated with the dilution effect in the latitude region 40 - 60 deg S is about 1 year, long enough to contribute to the observed year-round decrease of total ozone in that region...|$|R
40|$|Results {{are given}} of SBUV (solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument)</b> {{measurements}} from Nimbus 7, when - one day per month - it is operated in a spectral scan mode, scanning from 160 nm to 400 nm in 0. 2 -nm steps. By measuring {{the intensity of}} a series of nitric oxide (NO) gamma band fluorescence features in this wavelength range, it has been possible to estimate the amount of NO in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The background of atmospherically scattered sunlight normally masks the much weaker NO gamma band emission, but these emission features are discriminated by subtracting a synthetic spectrum calculated for a model atmosphere that includes only Rayleigh scattering and absorption by ozone and oxygen. The resulting difference plot clearly reveals features resulting from processes not included in the simple model, such as NO gamma band emission. Nitric oxide is inferred by measuring the absolute intensity of various bands relative to the adjacent background and relating this intensity to total NO above an altitude determined by the backscattering contribution function for that band. NO observations near the solstice and at various latitudes are reported...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{wavelength}} pair ozone values {{determined from}} <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (BUV) <b>instrument</b> measurements are directly correlated with scene reflectivity which, in turn, {{is a function}} of scene cloudiness. At low solar zenith angles (overhead sun), maximum discrepancies between pair values of 2 to 3 percent. These discrepancies are believed to be due to algorithmic behavior and imply a mean error in the final derived ozone of approximately 5 percent for cases of 50 percent reflectivity. Results using a new algorithm show a significant decrease in pair discrepancy and, therefore, in the error of the final derived ozone...|$|R
40|$|The <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> on the Atmosphere Explorer-E {{satellite}} {{has acquired}} {{a large body of}} stratospheric and total ozone data in the tropical region. The latitudinal variation of the ozone mixing ratio on constant pressure surfaces shows the transition from chemical domination to transport control between 5 and 10 mb. Spectral analysis of the longitudinal O 3 structure reveals large wavenumber 1 and 2 patterns, although considerable activity in wavenumbers 5 through 7 sometimes appears. Longitudinal structure increases with decreasing pressure between 30 and 5 mb. The spatial variability near 5 mb must reflect similar structure in the odd nitrogen distribution which provides the major loss mechanism for ozone at this level...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of the atmospheric pollution problem are the anthropogenic impacts on the stratospheric ozone layer, the related trends of the total ozone content drop and the solar ultraviolet radiation enhancement at the Earth's surface level. During September 2002, the ozone hole over the Antarctic was much smaller than in the previous six years. It has split into two separate holes, due to the appearance of sudden stratospheric warming that has never been observed before in the southern hemisphere. The analysis of this unprecedented event is attempted, regarding both the meteorological and photochemical aspects, in terms of the unusual thermal field patterns and the induced polar vortex disturbances. Introduction. The total ozone content (TOC) observations currently performed by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) flown on the NASA Earth Probe satellite and the NOAA- 16 Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> (SBUV/ 2) showed that the size of the Antarcti...|$|E
40|$|Data on monthly ozone {{abundance}} trends {{near the}} stratopause, observed by the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) on the SME {{and by the}} Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>Instrument</b> (SBUV) on NIMBUS- 7 are presented for June, September, and January of the years 1982 - 1986. Globally averaged trends determined from the SME data (- 0. 5 + or - 1. 3 percent/yr) were found to fall within model calculations by Rusch and Clancy (1988); the SBUV trends, on the other hand, were found to exceed maximum predicted ozone decreases {{by a factor of}} 3 or more. Detailed comparison of the two data sets indicated that an absolute offset of 3 percent/yr accounts for much of {{the difference between the two}} trends; the offset is considered to be due to incomplete characterization of the SBUV calibration drift. Both the UVS and SBUV data exhibited similar seasonal and latitudinal variations in ozone trends, which were reproduced by photochemical model calculations that included latitude-dependent NMC temperature trends over the 1982 - 1986 period...|$|E

The existence of high intensity surges has been discovered which occur on a sporadic basis and which cause sufficient enhancements of dark current within the subauroral regions to produce background levels similar to those within the South Atlantic anomaly.
