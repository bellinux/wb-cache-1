5|$|Proposals in January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge and putting SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> limit its toll revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> reduce its car parking profits. Similar objections would apply to a rail link.|$|E
5|$|A king is {{in check}} {{when it is}} under attack {{by at least one}} enemy piece. A piece unable to move <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the {{opposing}} player.|$|E
5|$|The diagram {{shows an}} example checkmate position. The white king is {{threatened}} by the black queen; the square to which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> then be in check by the rook.|$|E
5000|$|... (2) in {{any event}} the 1972 {{amendment}} was to be construed to apply retroactively <b>because</b> otherwise <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be irrational.|$|R

5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much more difficult to detect <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|If a cell {{containing}} {{the key is}} found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot be in the table, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been placed in}} that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the key is not present in the dictionary.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a new conical turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7's turret and to arm it with the 76.2mm L-10 tank gun. Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it was impossible to implement this project <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E
50|$|The Protocol {{does not}} {{prohibit}} attacks against binoculars, periscopes, telescopes, and other optical equipment <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was unknown whether laser attacks on such devices could cause permanent blindness. Article 3 allows for attacks on electronic optical equipment, <b>because</b> damaging <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not cause human injury.|$|R
50|$|Lord Hope, {{in a short}} concurring judgment, {{expressed}} the view that discrimination is not justified just <b>because</b> eliminating <b>it</b> <b>would</b> put others at a disadvantage that {{was not related to}} their age.|$|R
50|$|The flag {{is never}} lowered to half-mast {{as a sign}} of mourning, <b>because</b> {{lowering}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be considered blasphemous. Similarly, the flags of Afghanistan, Somaliland, and Iraq are also never at half-mast.|$|R
5|$|Jack Mann bought Kona Lanes in 1980 and re-branded it New Kona Lanes the {{following}} year. Mann's family owned several bowling {{centers in the}} region; he was behind the creation of Fountain Bowl in 1973 and the short-lived Regal Lanes in Orange in 1974. He also owned Tustin Lanes before selling it to his youngest son, Alex. Mann bought Kona not because he loved bowling, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> continue to pay dividends if {{he was no longer}} able to work. He later sold Kona to his son Jack Jr.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been better had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easy to maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E

50|$|Gettelfinger {{announced}} in March 2009 {{that he would}} not seek a third term as UAW president, leading some news outlets to declare King one of his possible successors. Shortly thereafter, King began stepping up his criticism of the three largest American automakers. He had particularly harsh words for General Motors, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> took aid from the federal government and yet still closed plants and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> import vehicles from overseas to meet U.S. demand.|$|R

5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly {{like that of}} the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} built because the {{previous}} bridge, built in 1956, was {{nearing the end}} of its life span. The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs, but it was decided by the N.S. Government that an entirely new bridge would be more cost-effective. The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{to remove the}} train from the site began {{on the evening of}} 1 March 2007 with the first carriages moved from the embankment. This allowed passengers' property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to the train interior, which previously had not been possible <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been unsafe. The last of the carriages were removed on 4 March 2007 and the A685 road was reopened.|$|E

5|$|There must be no {{compromise}} with Canada's existence as a nation. Opting out, two flags, two pension plans, associated states, Two Nations {{and all the}} other baggage of political dualism was ushering Quebec out of Confederation on the instalment plan. He could not accept any theory of two nations, however worded, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make of those neither French nor English second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary work on the construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam. Some favored the latter design <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} {{after the}} sales call, Andy steals Dwight's keys, breaks into his car, and finds the toll booth ticket to New York City. Andy gives {{the evidence to}} Michael, who then accuses Dwight of disloyalty, and Angela prevents him from clearing his name <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> expose their relationship. Dwight resigns. Andy gloats over his success, but the documentary camera catches Angela in the background glaring at him.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1985 {{interview}} with People, Tullis said, [...] "They {{tried to say}} his intelligence was impaired, but it wasn't true. I think they wanted {{to keep him out}} of the classroom <b>because</b> thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> bother the other kids' parents." ...|$|R

Because the initials aren't 'LSD.' Lucy in the sky with diamonds is more like that." ...|$|R
50|$|Raskin {{began writing}} about {{technology}} in the 1980s. Her first technology piece appeared in a 1984 issue of InfoWorld. The article, True Confessions, documented her attraction to technology as an equalizer for women <b>because</b> ultimately <b>it</b> <b>would</b> provide them freedom without shackling them to an office.|$|R
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
