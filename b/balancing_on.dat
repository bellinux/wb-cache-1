25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, she resumed {{acting in}} her theater, usually {{performing}} single acts of classics such as Racine's Athelee, {{which did not}} require much movement. For her curtain calls, she stood, <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> one leg and gesturing with one arm. She also starred in a new play, Daniel, written by her grandson-in-law, playwright Louis Verneuil. She played the male lead role, but appeared in just two acts. She took the play and other famous scenes from her repertory on a European tour and then for her last tour of England, where she gave a special command performance for Queen Mary, followed by {{a tour of the}} British provinces.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292, an Airbus A320 {{discovered}} {{a problem with}} its landing gear as it took off from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. It flew in circles for three hours to burn off fuel, then landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport on runway 25L, <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> its back wheels as it rolled {{down the center of}} the runway. Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E
25|$|Where possible, {{the tunnel}} routes avoided granite and instead they were routed through looser shale rock formations; this speeded up {{construction}} and was less labour-intensive, {{but it could}} also be dangerous due to an increased risk of rockfalls. The tunnels were dug by the traditional method of drilling and blasting. When the tunnels were bored out, they were lined with concrete. First, the floor was lined, followed by the walls, and, finally, the roof. The walls were concreted using wooden shuttering, the space between the shuttering and the rock face was filled with concrete, and the shuttering subsequently removed. The roof was made in the same way, but using curved shuttering <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> the concrete walls. Concrete was poured down the escape shafts rather than through the tunnel entrances to avoid contamination with the rock leaving the tunnel; these chutes can still be seen in many of the tunnels.|$|E

5000|$|In {{rare cases}} when {{considering}} a boxer twin, the categories 4. Plane <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> reciprocating mass, 6. Plane <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> rotating mass and sometimes 14. Plane <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> torque generation are included, yet statements like [...] "A flat-8 boxer engine has a perfect inherent balance" [...] ignore these three categories (as well as 16. Plane imbalance on compression) as flat-8 boxer configuration has inherent imbalance in these four categories {{by having the}} left and right banks staggered front to back (not positioned symmetrically in plan view) {{in the same manner as}} in boxer twin.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{mountain}} is extremely characteristic. Only from northwest {{does it look like}} a 'tind' a high pointy summit in Norwegian. From the east, from Galdhøpiggen, it shows its steep wall with Nåle <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> the left flank, as seen in the table. This wall {{is one of the more}} inaccessible in Jotunheimen and is climbed rarely. The southwest face is less forbidding, and it is possible to find a way up through the partly snow-covered talus slopes. The mountain, as its neighbors, consists of the hard gabbro rock, which withstands erosion better than most other rocks. The orientation of the layers of gabbro in Skarstind is uncommon. Normally they rise from northwest towards southeast, which is why many summits are easiest to reach from the north side. At Skarstind the layers rise from southwest towards northeast. This is easily seen on the photo in the table.|$|E
25|$|The Keladi Nayakas (period: 1499 – 1763) built {{some fine}} temples in Ikkeri and Keladi using a {{combination}} of late Kadamba, Hoysala, Vijayanagara and Dravida styles. The use of granite for their construction shows that they simply followed the Vijayanagar model of architecture. The Aghoreshwara Temple at Ikkeri and the Rameshwara Temple at Keladi are the best examples of the Nayakas' art. Vijayanagar-style pillars with hippogryphs are common; called yali columns (depiction of horses and lions as seen in Hampi) is found here. These are pillars with lions, either with their forepaws raised or simply in a sitting position, and pillars with a mythical horse-like animal with front legs raised, <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> its rear legs, and with an armed rider on its back. A roof sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda (see image in infobox), the mythical two-headed bird of Karnataka, symbol of the state, is found in Keladi.|$|E
25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet {{covering}} his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

25|$|After his 2011 arrest, Jaishankar {{was kept}} at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bangalore. He {{was sentenced to}} 27 years in prison. At the Bangalore jail, he {{underwent}} treatment for psychiatric problems. On 31 August 2013, the police took Jaishankar to the court in Tumkur near Bangalore. After returning, Jaishankar feigned uneasiness and {{was admitted to the}} hospital within the prison premises. He managed to secure a duplicate key and used it at 2 am on 1 September 2013, when the daily change of guards took place. The police suspected that an insider helped him get the duplicate key. He scaled a 20-foot wall, then walked atop a 15-foot wall and finally scaled the 30-foot high compound wall. He managed to cross the electric fence safely, since it was not functional that night. He reportedly carried with him a bamboo pole <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> the walls and a bedsheet to serve as a cushion over the glass pieces on the wall top. He was injured during the escape, and drops of blood were found outside the outer wall. He was reportedly wearing a police uniform during his escape. 11 Jail staff, including 3 wardens, 2 jailors and 6 security guards, were suspended following his escape.|$|E

The shells are shown as if <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge of the}} lip and/or the apex; this was presumably done for artistic reasons as these shells cannot balance like this.|$|E

500|$|The race {{took place}} in very wet and windy conditions. This {{included}} a headwind {{in the early stages}} of the race, which delayed the formation of a breakaway. When the breakaway did form, it included seven riders, who built up a nine-minute lead within the first hour of racing. These riders were Tim Kerkhof (...) , Alexis Gougeard (...) , Albert Timmer (...) , Alex Dowsett (...) , Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff-Saxo), Jesse Sergent (Trek Factory Racing) and Mirko Tedeschi (...) [...] Soon afterwards the peloton was split into groups as riders began to withdraw from the race.

For [...] "Dead Putting Society", the animators went {{on a field trip}} to a local miniature golf course to study the mechanics of a golf club swing. Moore commented that the reason for this was that much of the humor on The Simpsons comes from making the scenery look lifelike; [...] "The realism of the background serves as the straight man for the absurd situations." ...|$|E
