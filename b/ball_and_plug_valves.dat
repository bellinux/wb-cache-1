40|$|The term "valve " {{applies to}} a variety of devices for {{controlling}} the flow of liquid. Various valves allow for on-off control, modulation of the flow rate through the system, and prevention of back flow. They can also be used for pressure relief or as a safety device. In general, valves can vary from simple manual on-off devices to sophisticated control equipment which act as metering instruments and deliver predetermined amounts of water to the system. ON-OFF SERVICE VALVES For normal on-off control the best choices are gate, <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> <b>valves.</b> The on-off service valves function by sliding or by turning a flat, cylindrical or spherical flow control element over an orifice in th...|$|E
50|$|A closed soft {{seated valve}} {{is much less}} liable to leak when shut while hard seated valves are more durable. Gate, globe, and check valves are usually hard seated while butterfly, <b>ball,</b> <b>plug,</b> <b>and</b> {{diaphragm}} <b>valves</b> are usually soft seated.|$|R
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn <b>valve.</b> Butterfly, <b>ball</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an outlet line. Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFugitive {{emissions}} {{are one of}} the pollution that can affect environment, health and also economy. It is a deemed to be {{an important part of the}} debate on climate change because they represent a significant portion of greenhouse gas emission. It is estimated that 60 - 70 % of the fugitive emission comes from valve. This paper presented a study which focusing on fugitive emission by valve, which will be solved using GAMS to optimize the selection of valve and achieve the objective. The fugitive emission is minimized by replacing the current valve with new valve based on its emission rate. Type of valve that has been considered in this study is ball valve, gate valve, butterfly <b>valve,</b> globe <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> <b>valve.</b> Based from the results, it can be said that <b>plug</b> <b>valve,</b> gate <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> butterfly valve is most preferable compare to other type of valve for fugitive emission reduction. Different types of valves give different price, so, the selection of valve are depending on the budget of the project. The fugitive emission can be reducing in easy way at the design stage by using GAMS application to optimize it...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Data on {{pressure}} drop were obtained in stainless steel, sanitary fittings and valves during laminar and turbulent flow of aqueous solutions of sucrose and xanthan gum, which were selected as model fluids. The rheological properties of these solutions were determined and the power-law model provided the best fit for experimental data. Friction losses were measured in fully and partially open butterfly <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> <b>valves,</b> bends <b>and</b> unions. Values of loss coefficients (kf) were calculated and correlated {{as a function}} of the generalized Reynolds number by the two-k method. The model adjustment was satisfactory and was better in the laminar flow range (0. 976 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 999) than in the turbulent flow range (0. 774 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 989). In order to test the adequacy of the results for predicting loss coefficients during flow of real fluids, experiments were conducted with coffee extract. Comparison between experimental and predicted loss coefficients showed very good agreement...|$|R

5000|$|A Straus flask (often misspelled [...] "Strauss") is {{subclass}} of [...] "bomb" [...] flask {{originally developed}} by Kontes Glass Company, commonly used for storing dried and degassed solvents. Straus flasks are {{sometimes referred to}} as solvent bombs — a name which applies to any Schlenk bomb dedicated to storing solvent. Straus flasks are mainly differentiated from other [...] "bombs" [...] by their neck structure. Two necks emerge from a round bottom flask, one larger than the other. The larger neck ends in a ground glass joint and is permanently partitioned by blown glass from direct access to the flask. The smaller neck includes the threading required for a teflon plug to be screwed in perpendicular to the flask. The two necks are joined through a glass tube. The ground glass joint can be connected to a manifold directly or through an adapter and hosing. Once connected, the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> can be partially opened to allow the solvent in the Straus flask to be vacuum transferred to other vessels. Or, once connected to the line, the neck can be placed under a positive pressure of inert gas <b>and</b> the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> can be fully removed. This allows direct access to the flask through a narrow glass tube now protected by a curtain of inert gas. The solvent can then be transferred through cannula to another flask. In contrast, other bomb flask plugs are not necessarily ideally situated to protect the atmosphere of the flask from the external atmosphere.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are valves with {{cylindrical}} or conically tapered [...] "plugs" [...] {{which can}} be rotated inside the valve body to control flow through the <b>valve.</b> The <b>plugs</b> in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> have one or more hollow passageways going sideways through the plug, so that fluid can flow through the <b>plug</b> when the <b>valve</b> is open. <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are simple <b>and</b> often economical.|$|R
5000|$|Stopcocks used in {{laboratory}} glassware are typically forms of conically tapered <b>plug</b> <b>valves.</b> When fused with the glassware, the valve bodies {{are made of}} glass. Otherwise, they can be made of an inert plastic such as Teflon. The plugs can be made of a similar plastic or glass. When the plug is made of glass, the handle <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> are fused together in one piece out of glass. When glass is used for both the stopcock body <b>and</b> the <b>plug,</b> the contacting surfaces between them are special ground glass surfaces (see Laboratory glassware) often with stopcock grease in between. Special glass stopcocks are made for vacuum applications, such as in use with vacuum manifolds. Stopcock grease is always used in high vacuum applications to make the stopcock air-tight. Also if the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> is [...] "locked" [...] from being in the open or closed position for an extended amount of time lubricant can be added through the greaser with the valve in service.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} for a <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> {{to have more than}} two ports. In a 3-way <b>plug</b> <b>valve,</b> flow from one port could be directed to either the second or third port. A 3-way <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> could also be designed to shift flow between ports 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, and possibly even connect all three ports together. The flow-directing possibilities in multi-port <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> are similar to the possibilities in corresponding multi-port ball valves or corresponding multi-port valves with a rotor. An additional possibility in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> is to have one port {{on one side of the}} <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> two ports on the other side, with two diagonal and parallel fluid pathways inside the plug. In this case the plug can be rotated 180° to connect the port on the one side to either of the two ports on the other side.|$|R

50|$|This {{pressure}} {{is transferred to}} the valve stem, which is connected to either the <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> (see <b>plug</b> <b>valve),</b> butterfly valve etc. Larger forces are required in high pressure or high flow pipelines to allow the valve to overcome these forces, {{and allow it to}} move the valves moving parts to control the material flowing inside.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common general type of <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> is a 2-port valve with two positions: open to allow flow, and shut (closed) to stop flow. Ports are {{openings in the}} valve body through which fluid can enter or leave. The plug {{in this kind of}} valve has one passageway going through it. The ports are typically at opposite ends of the body; therefore, the plug is rotated a fourth of a full turn to change from open to shut positions. This makes this kind of <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> a quarter-turn valve. There is often a mechanism limiting motion of the handle to a quarter turn, but not in glass stopcocks.|$|R
40|$|Six ball plugs {{were used}} to seal the oil lines in Jaguar {{cylinder}} heads using the press-fit process. The balls were made out of the 7075 Al alloy and were produced by forging, whereas the heads were made from the 319 Al alloy and were low pressure cast at the Essex Aluminum Plant (EAP), and machined at the Cleveland Engine Plant (CEP). The ball plugs were inserted at the CEP. Leaking was observed through the ball plugs during the CEP engine quality control operation. An investigation was launched to determine and eliminate {{the cause of the}} leaks. In order to isolate the main leak culprits, tests were subdivided into sections, which included: the heat treatment parameters applied to the 319 Al cylinder heads; metallurgical and geometrical characterization of the <b>ball</b> <b>plug</b> including: <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> casting microstructural analysis, hardness and homogeneity analysis, casting scratch and compression tests, characterization of the ball/casting hole wall interface, <b>ball</b> <b>plug</b> insertion <b>and</b> pressure tightness tests, effect of the insertion speed, <b>ball</b> lubrication <b>and</b> casting microhardness on the insertion force; geometrical investigation of the cylinder head boss design; leak mechanisms SEM/EDS investigation, as well as the Finite Element Analysis of the stress distribution in the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> cylinder <b>plug</b> systems.

5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> four <b>valves,</b> activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|R
40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular valve seat that defines an annular valve orifice between {{the edges of}} the annular valve seat, an annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> on <b>and</b> off the annular valve seat. The use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} valve seat. Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> the annular <b>valve</b> seat for the valve to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug.</b> The use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of the valve...|$|R
