25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E

30|$|To our knowledge, {{our study}} {{is the first to}} focus on {{patients}} with high-PCT values (above 2  µg/L) in emergency septic patients. Our results suggest a moderate relation between PCT level and outcome, in the specific population of septic patients with high PCT. As expected, we find a higher cutoff than previous studies performed in ED [3, 15 – 17], <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a better specificity. In terms of patients’ recruitment, our results should be compared to those of Hur et al. [7] who investigated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of PCT in critically ill patients with suspected sepsis in ED and ICU, for whom sepsis was diagnosed clinically or on PCT concentrations. Thus, our results are in accordance with those of Hur et al. [7], as we found similar PCT values in non-survivors (mean PCT at admission around 32  µg/L).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{present the}} case of a patient with {{extensor}} carpi ulnaris tendon subluxation who was first treated for distal radioulnar joint sprain. Case presentation A 25 -year-old Caucasian man was seen at our policlinic one month after he had fallen on his outstretched hand. A diagnosis of extensor carpi ulnaris subluxation was made clinically <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the magnetic resonance imaging scan of the patient’s wrist which displayed an increased signal on T 2 -weighted images consistent with inflammation around the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon. The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon was found to be dislocating during supination and relocating during pronation. The sheath was reconstructed using extensor retinaculum due to attenuation of subsheath. Conclusion There was no recurrent dislocation of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon of the patient at his last follow up 12 months after the operation. </p...|$|R
