5|$|A {{long-term}} {{goal of the}} IFAF is for American football {{to be accepted by}} the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. The only time that the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order to be accepted by the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that is in favor of American teams.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was his {{development of a}} complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe. He felt that his languages changed and developed over time, as with the historical languages which he studied professionally—not in a vacuum, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them.|$|E
5|$|Avram Steuerman-Rodion, {{a socialist}} based in Iași, contributed a special series of {{articles}} documenting the growth of Germanophila in that city, and throughout Moldavia region. Titled Scrisori din Iași ("Letters from Iași"), it notably chronicled the conflicts between the enthusiastically Ententist University of Bucharest professors and their more skeptical University of Iași colleagues. Seara also enlisted contributions from physician Ottoi Călin, {{a member of the}} PSDR Executive Committee and author of its Zimmerwald pacifist manifesto. Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political panelist, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> practicing physician, held Searas advice column.|$|E

5|$|Banglapedia was not {{designed}} as a general encyclopedia <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specialized encyclopedia on Bangladesh-related topics. For the encyclopedia's purposes, Bangladesh {{is defined as the}} territory comprising ancient Eastern India, Suba Bangla, Shahi Bangalah, Mughal Suba Bangla, Bengal Presidency, Bengal Province, East Bengal, East Pakistan, and the independent Bangladesh, in historical succession.|$|E
5|$|Breuer {{attended}} the Paralympics in London, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair basketball player {{rather than as}} a fencer. She was introduced to the sport by a friend, and spotted by a national trainer. Breuer played for Sabines Ulm, where she was the only woman on a mixed gender side. She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E
5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production {{is used in}} the electronics industry, and the remainder {{is used in the}} pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E
5|$|Cone {{production}} varies a {{great deal}} from year to year, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of its low flowering rate, is generally very low. However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading to relatively high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the curculionid weevil Cechides amoenus.|$|E
5|$|Contracts {{were signed}} at Spring's tavern {{and it was}} {{arranged}} for the fight to take place at Hanslope, Buckinghamshire. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vast crowd of spectators began pouring into Hanslope the venue was switched {{at the last minute}} to Salcey Green, just inside Northamptonshire, thus rendering the Buckinghamshire constables powerless to prevent it.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|Dodd is a Grade IV equestrian competitor, {{coached by}} Peter Turner. Due to her sacral agenesis, when she rides her horse, she dislocates several bones every time, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of {{anti-doping}} rules, {{she has had}} to find alternative ways of coping with pain associated with riding.|$|E

5|$|His films also {{typically}} {{end with}} a death, which is portrayed not as a tragedy, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E
5|$|In 1705, the Pope sent a Papal Legate to the Kangxi Emperor, to {{communicate}} to him the interdiction of Chinese rites. The mission, led by Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon, communicated the prohibition of Chinese rites in January 1707, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result was banished to Macao.|$|E
5|$|In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film {{starring}} Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's {{music is}} briefly featured, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of cultural conservatism {{in a nation}} {{on the cusp of}} the rock and roll revolution.|$|E

At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> branch of the Nasjonal Samling.|$|E
5|$|In battle, Marko used {{not only}} his {{strength}} and prowess but cunning and trickery. Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mortal man. There were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.|$|E
