METHODS: Seventy rats were randomly divided into seven groups of ten animals each. All of the animals underwent segmental resection of the left colon and end-to-end anastomosis. The animals in groups I to VI underwent surgical laparoscopies with pneumoperitoneums using carbon dioxide or helium at pressures of 5, 12 or 20 mmHg. In Group VII, open laparotomy was performed. The animals were reoperated on postoperative day 7 to measure the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> and the breaking strength of the anastomosis.

A premature increase in pressure is sign of a potential blockage and continuing to pump risks <b>burst</b> <b>pressure</b> retaining components. Pumping more than an anticipated amount of fluid is a sign of a loss of integrity and a potential leak path somewhere.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Failure of anastomotic {{healing is}} one of the major {{complications}} in colorectal surgery. Because histamine plays an important role in immune and inflammatory reactions, we demonstrate the effects of famotidine on the healing of colonic anastomosis in rats. METHODS: Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. Excision and end-to-end anastomosis was performed in the distal colon of the rat. The Famotidine Group received 2 mg/kg/day famotidine; the Control Group received the same amount of saline. <b>Bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> of anastomoses and hydroxyproline content of perianastomotic tissues were evaluated on the third and seventh days following surgery.

The algorithms and neural nets designed for calculating the dimensions of a corrosion feature are complicated and often they are closely guarded trade secrets. An anomaly is often reported in a simplified fashion as a cubic feature with an estimated length, width and depth.

50|$|Tubular modules look {{similar to}} {{shell and tube}} heat {{exchangers}} with bundles of tubes with the active surface of the membrane on the inside. Flow through the tubes is normally turbulent, ensuring low concentration polarisation but also increasing energy costs. The tubes can either be self-supporting or supported by insertion into perforated metal tubes. This module design is limited for nanofiltration by the pressure they can withstand before bursting, limiting the maximum flux possible. Due to both the high energy operating costs of turbulent flow and the limiting <b>burst</b> <b>pressure,</b> tubular modules are more suited to ‘dirty’ applications where feeds have particulates such as filtering raw water to gain potable water in the Fyne process. The membranes can be easily cleaned through a ‘pigging’ technique with foam balls are squeezed through the tubes, scouring the caked deposits.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During bowel surgery, {{perioperative}} {{blood loss}} and hypotension {{can lead to}} transient intestinal ischemia. Recent preclinical studies reveal that the strength of intestinal anastomoses can be compromised after reperfusion. So far, this phenomenon has not been investigated {{in the very first}} days of healing when wound strength is lowest. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ischemia was induced in rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and ileal branches for 30 min. Immediately after declamping, anastomoses were constructed in both terminal ileum and descending colon. The same was done in control groups after sham-ischemia. Anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> and breaking strength were measured immediately after operation (day 0) and after 1, 2, or 3 days. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content, gelatinase activity, and histology were analyzed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In ileal anastomoses, at day 1, both the breaking strength and <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower in the ischemic group, while at day 2, this was the case for the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> only. In the colon, the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ischemic group was lower at day 1. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content remained unchanged. Increased presence of the various gelatinase activities was found in ileum only at day 0 and in colon at days 1 and 2. Histological mucosal damage was found in ischemia-reperfusion groups. CONCLUSION: Transient mesenteric ischemia can negatively affect anastomotic strength during the very first days of healing, even if the tissue used for anastomotic construction looks vital...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Protecting the anastomotic {{integrity}} using suture or staple line reinforcement {{remains an}} important goal for ongoing research. The present comprehensive study aims to establish the effects of fibrin glue on the early phase of anastomotic healing in the rat intestine. METHODS: One hundred and eight young adult male Wistar rats underwent resection and anastomosis of both the ileum and colon. In half, fibrin glue was applied around the anastomoses. Parameters for repair included wound strength, both <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> and breaking strength at days 1, 3, and 5 after operation; hydroxyproline content; and histology, the latter also after 7 days. RESULTS: A transient colonic ileus was observed in the experimental group. Anastomotic breaking strength was always similar in both the control and fibrin glue groups. Anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressures</b> remained low at days 1 and 3, without any differences between the groups. In both groups, the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> increased sharply (p < 0. 001) between days 3 and 5. At day 5, the <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> in the fibrin glue group remained below than that in the controls, although only significantly (p = 0. 0138) so in the ileum. At day 5, but not at day 7, the wounds in the fibrin glue group contained less collagen. Other aspects of microscopic wound architecture {{appeared to be the}} same. CONCLUSIONS: There is no justification for using fibrin glue on patent anastomoses constructed under low-risk conditions.

40|$|Background and aims: While {{mechanical}} parameters (breaking strength, <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure)</b> {{are used}} to measure colonic anastomotic healing, reported values are inconsistent. This study developed a novel approach to study colonic anastomotic repair and compared it with mechanical methods. Methods and materials: We created standardized four- and eight-suture colonic anastomoses and performed contrast enemas in rats. Results: All eight-suture anastomoses were tight at completion. In contrast, all four-suture anastomoses leaked immediately after the operation, but the integrity increased progressively, and at 12 h all were closed. No changes in breaking strength were observed up to 3 days postoperatively, in contrast to anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> which increased progressively over the same period. Integrity and <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> increased in parallel to the anastomotic content of myeloperoxidase (MPO), indicating that neutrophil infiltration is not detrimental in normal healing. Moreover, local irradiation, which enhanced MPO activity, did not increase leakage, suggesting that neutrophil accumulation per se {{has no effect on}} the integrity of colonic anastomosis. In addition, administration of 5 -fluorouracil, which decreased anastomotic MPO levels, increased anastomotic leakage. Conclusion: We present a novel approach to study anastomotic healing using radiological examination. While <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> appears to be suitable for measuring early anastomotic healing in the colon, we demonstrate that breaking strength is not sufficiently sensitive to be used in examination of early healing. Moreover, our data suggest that the acute inflammatory response and associated neutrophil recruitment in the anastomosis does not negatively affect healing in the rat colon...|$|R

However, how to precisely determine if the bowel can withstand the pressure of a colorectal anastomosis experiment, which is called anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure,</b> has not been determined. MethodA task force developed the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system to provide precise measurement of the maximum pressure that an anastomotic colon can withstand, and to compare it with the commonly used method such as the mercury and air bag pressure manometer in a rat colon rupture pressure test. Forty-five male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into the manual ball manometry (H) group, the tracing machine manometry pressure gauge head (MP) group, and the experimental animal hollow organ mechanical testing system (ME) group. The rats in each group were subjected to a cut colon rupture pressure test after injecting anesthesia in the tail vein. Colonic end-to-end anastomosis was performed, and the rats were rested for 1 week before anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> was determined by one of the three methods. ResultsNo differences were observed between the normal colon rupture pressure and colonic anastomotic <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure,</b> which were determined using the three manometry methods.

40|$|The {{healing of}} {{colorectal}} anastomoses after irradiation therapy {{continues to be}} a major concern. The authors evaluated the healing of rectal anastomoses in a rat model after a preoperative 500 -cGy dose of cobalt 60 irradiation. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into two equal groups: control (group A), and irradiation group (group B). Group B received a single 500 -cGy dose of irradiation, and a rectal resection and end-to-end anastomosis was performed in both groups on the 7 th day after irradiation. Parameters of the healing process included <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> and collagen content on the 5 th, 7 th, and 14 th days after surgery. In the irradiation group, the mean <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> on the 5 th, 7 th, and 14 th days was 116, 218, and 273 mmHg, respectively. The collagen content assessed by histomorphometry was 9. 0, 20. 8, and 32 %, respectively. In contrast, the control group had a mean <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> of 175, 225 and 263 mmHg, and a collagen content of 17. 8, 28. 1, and 32. 1 %, respectively. The adverse effect of irradiation on healing was detectable only on the 5 th postoperative day, as demonstrated by lower <b>bursting</b> <b>pressure</b> (P < 0. 013) and collagen content (P < 0. 008). However, there was no failure of anastomotic healing such as leakage or dehiscence due to irradiation.
