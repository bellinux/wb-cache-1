Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> Peter's car.

50|$|Since Protean Electric’s motors fit <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle, {{they can}} be used as part of a drive system that does not require a gearbox, differential, or drive shafts. This creates an {{energy-efficient}} drivetrain that potentially saves cost, reduces weight and frees up space on board the vehicle that was previously dedicated to drivetrain components. According to Protean Electric, its in-wheel motors can increase fuel economy by over 30 percent depending on the battery size and driving cycle in a hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicle. It is also capable of enabling torque vectoring by applying individual torque at optimal levels to each wheel to improve vehicle safety and handling.|$|R
