After incubation, the media was discarded. Then, different concentrations of PV-AuNPs (0, 29.9, 59.8, 119.6, 239.2, and 478.3  μg/mL based on the Au concentration measured by ICP-OES analysis) were added to the cells with the culture medium in either {{the presence or absence of}} FBS.

40|$|Although many assays are {{available}} for the screening of expression libraries for carbohydrases, some enzymes cannot be detected because their substrates are incompatible with the existing assays. One thing that all carbohydrases {{have in common is}} that they increase the number of reducing ends when degrading their substrates. In this paper we explore the possibility of detecting this increase with the highly sensitive bicinchoninic acid (BCA) reducing value assay. This assay can be used for the detection of all carbohydrases degrading any polysaccharide; enzymes with either an exo- or an endo-type of mechanism can be detected at the same time.

Model predictions were first compared against experimental data obtained from the literature and subsequently used in a parametric study for investigating scale-up effects associated with both process and photoreactor variables. Investigated variables included: TiO 2 concentration (5 – 400 mg L− 1), initial oxalic acid concentration (0. 9 – 32 mg L− 1), lamp irradiance (100 – 10, 000 W m− 2), <b>background</b> fluid <b>absorbance</b> (0 - 30 m− 1), reactor size (1 / 4 - 4 as relative scaling factor), lamp orientation (0 - 360 °) and flowrate (2. 5 – 10 m 3 h− 1). The analysis revealed that an optimum in oxalic acid degradation is observed when the TiO 2 concentration was controlled in the 20 – 40 mg L− 1 range (depending on lamp irradiance). While lamp orientation showed minimal impact, reactor size and flowrate emerged as key variables for photoreactor design. Moreover, an increase in initial oxalic acid concentration substantially reduced oxalic acid degradation performance observed at high loadings.

40|$|Ultrathin {{tin oxide}} films were {{deposited}} on SiO 2 nanoparticles using {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) techniques with SnCl 4 and H 2 O 2 as the reactants. These SnOx films were then exposed to O 2 and CO gas pressure at 300 °C to measure and understand their ability to serve as CO gas sensors. In situ transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to monitor both the charge conduction in the SnOx films and the gas-phase species. The <b>background</b> infrared <b>absorbance</b> measured the electrical conductivity of the SnOx films based on Drude-Zener theory. O 2 pressure was observed to decrease the SnOx film conductivity. Addition of CO pressure then increased the SnOx film conductivity. Static experiments also monitored the buildup of gas-phase CO 2 reaction products as the CO reacted with oxygen species. These results were consistent with both ionosorption and oxygen-vacancy models for chemiresistant semiconductor gas sensors. Additional experiments demonstrated that O 2 pressure was not necessary for the SnOx films to detect CO pressure. The <b>background</b> infrared <b>absorbance</b> increased with CO pressure {{in the absence of}} O 2 pressure. These results indicate that CO can produce oxygen vacancies on the SnOx surface that ionize and release electrons that increase the SnOx film conductivity, as suggested by the oxygen-vacancy model. The time scale of the response of the SnOx films to O 2 and CO pressure was also measured by using transient experiments. The ultrathin SnOx ALD films with a thickness of ∼ 10 Å were able to respond to O 2 within ∼ 100 s and to CO within ∼ 10 s.

40|$|Our {{research}} {{purpose is}} to build up new and efficient methods to quantitate amounts of air-borne asbestos. A basic idea behind the methods {{is the use of}} a FT-IR instrument to measure the asbestos absorbances. Karen McCune, an ex-coworker in our group, developed three procedures to eliminate <b>background</b> <b>absorbances</b> from the filters on which the asbestos is collected. These procedures included the spectral subtraction, the chemical digestion, and the ashing of cellulose ester filters. My research has ultilized and expanded on the ashing procedure. First, the detection limits and linearity of the aforementioned transmission method were determined. Using amosite asbestos, we developed a standard curve from 40 tg to 2 µg which agreed well with Beer's Law. We determined that the detection limit of this method resulted from minutely contaminated salt and not from instrumental limitations. Even using highly pure KBr, CsCl, or KC 1, similar detection limits were obtained. Second, the use of diffuse reflection to measure the asbestos absorbances was investigated. The method, much simpler than the transmission technique, consists of pouring the recovered asbestos-salt mixture into a small cup and obtaining the diffuse reflectance spectrum using a special accessory. A standard curve of amosite ranging from 40 p. g to 1. tg was produced. One important observation was that when KCl adsorbed water from the air while a background spectrum was collected, the water absorption band contributed negatively to the area under the Si-O stretching region. This contribution prohibits the detection of smaller amounts of amosite. A standard curve of chrysotile asbestos ranging from 40 µg to 5 µg was also produced. Another goal of our research is to investigate the quantitation and identification capabilities when asbestos is present as mixtures of amosite, chrysotile, or other closely related silicates such as, kaolin. In conjunction with the diffuse reflection method, a curve fitting program was used to analyze the amount of each component in a mixture. First mixtures of amosite and chrysotile were studied. Then mixtures of amosite, chrysotile, and kaolin, mixtures which resemble the real world's environment, were studied. Overall, the FT-IR spectroscopic methods are more efficient and applicable than the traditional fiber-counting methods. Our methods not only objectively quantitate the amount of asbestos but also identify the type. Department of ChemistryThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and measurement of snake venom in blood {{is important for}} confirming snake identification, determining when sufficient antivenom has been given, detecting recurrence of envenoming, and in forensic investigation. Venom enzyme immunoassays (EIA) have had persistent problems with poor sensitivity and high <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> leading to false positive results. This is particularly problematic with Australasian snakes where small amounts of highly potent venom are injected, resulting in low concentrations being associated with severe clinical effects. We aimed to develop a venom EIA with a limit of detection (LoD) sufficient to accurately distinguish mild envenoming from <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> at picogram concentrations of venom in blood. Serum samples were obtained from patients with taipan bites (Oxyuranus spp.) before and after antivenom, and from rats given known venom doses. A sandwich EIA was developed using biotinylated rabbit anti-snake venom antibodies for detection. For low venom concentrations (i. e. < 1 ng/mL) the assay was done before and after addition of antivenom to the sample (antivenom difference method). The LoD was 0. 15 ng/mL for the standard assay and 0. 1 ng/mL for the antivenom difference method. In 11 pre-antivenom samples the median venom concentration was 10 ng/mL (Range: 0. 3 – 3212 ng/mL). In four patients with incomplete venom-induced consumption coagulopathy the median venom concentration was 2. 4 ng/mL compared to 30 ng/mL in seven patients with complete venom-induced consumption coagulopathy. No venom was detected in any post-antivenom sample and the median antivenom dose prior to this first post-antivenom sample was 1. 5 vials (1 – 3 vials), including 7 patients administered only 1 vial. In rats the assay distinguished a 3 -fold difference in venom dose administered and there was small inter-individual variability. There was small but measurable cross-reactivity with black snake (Pseudechis), tiger snake (Notechis) and rough-scale snake (Tropidechis carinatus) venoms with the assay for low venom concentrations (< 1 ng/mL).

40|$|In this thesis, in situ Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{was used}} to study: i) the growth and pyrolysis of molecular layer deposition (MLD) films ii) the surface chemistry of atomic layer etching (ALE) processes Atomic layer processes such as molecular layer deposition (MLD) and atomic layer etching (ALE) are techniques that can add or remove material with atomic level precision using sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. Deposition and removal processes at the atomic scale are powerful tools for many industrial and research applications such as energy storage and semiconductor nanofabrication. The first section of this thesis describes the chemistry of reactions leading to the MLD of aluminum and tin alkoxide polymer films known as “alucone” and “tincone”, respectively. The subsequent pyrolysis of these films to produce metal oxide/carbon composites was also investigated. In situ FTIR spectroscopy was conducted to monitor surface species during MLD film growth and to monitor the films <b>background</b> infrared <b>absorbance</b> versus pyrolysis temperature. Ex situ techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), four-point probe and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to study {{the properties of the}} films post-pyrolysis. TEM confirmed that the pyrolyzed films maintained conformality during post-processing. Four-point probe monitored film resistivity versus pyrolysis temperature and XRD determined the film crystallinity. The second section of this thesis focuses on the surface chemistry of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 ALE processes, respectively. Thermal ALE processes have been recently developed which utilize sequential fluorination and ligand exchange reactions.

40|$|High {{sensitivity}} for indirect detection {{was achieved}} by utilising highly absorbing species as the displaced co-ion (or probe). Two highly absorbing dyes, bromocresol green and indigo-tetrasulfonate, were investigated as potential probes in the determination of small organic and inorganic anions. The concentration of these probes was kept {{as low as possible}} to ensure the signal-to-noise ratios were reasonable and the <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> was within the linear range of the detector. Four different protocols for buffering the electrolyte with such low probe concentrations were investigated. Buffering with agents that introduce co-anions [acetate or 2 -(cyclohexylamino) ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) buffers] proved unsuitable as detection sensitivities were diminished due to competitive displacement by the analytes and system peaks were also induced. Buffering without introduction of co-anions was achieved using the buffering base, diethanolamine, or the use of ampholytes, lysine and glutamic acid. For separations performed with these two buffering approaches, migration time reproducibilities were less than 1 % R. S. D. for most analytes. Minimal detectable amounts were in the low attomol region (1 · 10 − 18 mol), corresponding to sub-μM vacuum injected solution concentrations. These were an order of magnitude lower than the general detection limit reported for indirect photometric detection, and were comparable with detection limits achieved with indirect fluorescence detection. Finally, the detection limits were further improved by approximately three times for anions analysed with indigo-tetrasulfonate as the probe when a Z cell was employed as the detection cell...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{substantially}} improve the detection sensitivity and corresponding limits of detection (LODs) of methods for separation of anions and cations by capillary electrophoresis using indirect photometric detection. The approach taken in this project was to employ highly absorbing dyes as indirect detection probes as {{an effective way to}} increase the detection sensitivity. The benefits of using dyes as indirect detection probes in electrolytes buffered with isoelectric ampholytic buffers to enhance detection sensitivity have been demonstrated. Electrolytes containing the dyes, tartrazine and naphthol yellow S (ε= 21, 350 and 23, 125 L mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹ respectively), were properly buffered without the addition of co-ions by the use of the ampholytic buffer histidine at its isoelectric point. The increased absorptivity offered by both dyes in comparison to traditionally used anionic probes was reflected by the very low limits of detection (typically sub μM) achieved. Excellent peak shapes and separation efficiencies (up to 300, 000 theoretical plates) were observed. When electrolytes were buffered with low conductivity buffers, such as an ampholyte at its isoelectric point, the limiting factor regarding the probe concentration was the <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> and not the separation current. A detailed study on detection linearity of various CE instruments and detection configurations showed that most modern instruments retained a linear absorbance response far in excess of the absorbance range normally used for indirect photometric detection.

40|$|In {{indirect}} {{photometric detection}} in capillary electrophoresis, {{the concentration of}} the absorbing probe ion in the background electrolyte should {{be as high as}} possible in order to increase the dynamic range of the detection method. For relatively low absorptivity probes (15 000 L mol- 1 cm- 1) absorptivity probes such as dyes, the maximum concentration may be limited by the <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> of the electrolyte which must fall within the linearity range of the detector. In this work, it is shown that another practical factor limiting the probe concentration is the adsorption of probe onto the capillary wall at higher concentrations, resulting in unstable baseline and increased noise. Use of a zwitterionic surfactant to suppress adsorption enabled the concentration of a model probe anion (tartrazine) to be increased by a factor of six times (to 3 mM). This resulted in significant improvements in peaks shapes, resolution between peaks, detection sensitivity and linear calibration range for the analyte anions. Baseline separation of a test mixture was maintained up to 7. 5 mM total concentration of sample coions injected (13. 7 nL) for the 3 mM electrolyte, with detection limits ranging from 0. 63 to 0. 94 M. Peak height reproducibility (over 20 consecutive injections) was improved (values ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 9 %) compared with electrolytes containing lower concentrations of the probe. Overall, the optimised, higher concentration probe electrolyte provided the sensitivity benefits of highly absorbing probes with the additional benefits of ruggedness and improved stacking, peak shapes and resolution...|$|E
40|$|A new, atomic {{absorption}} spectrophotometric method for serum iron and iron-binding capacity is described, which utilizes 20 % (w/v) TCA plus heating at 90 #{ 176 }for 15 mm. This procedure liberates the ferric iron; precipitates the protein, facilitating removal by centrifugation; and avoids significant interferences by contaminating hemoglobin iron. The method is highly specific, accurate, {{and has the}} additional feature of requiring less time than most colorimetric or {{atomic absorption}} methods employing chelation and extraction. IN’lOST of the spectrophotometric methods for serum or plasma iron determinations suffer from {{at least one of}} three undesirable features: (1) low sensitivity of the color reaction employed, (2) turbidity in the final color solution, and (3) nonspecific <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> in the color solution (1). Atomic absorption spectrophotometry not only over-comes these problems, but it additionally has greater specificity and accuracy. Thus, various workers have used atomic absorption technics for the determination of iron in serum or plasma, and a variety of methods (2 - 4) have been developed to that end. Usually, the iron content was determined on undiluted plasma or a 1 : 1 dilution of plasma and deionized water. However, the high protein content of the atomized samples frequently gave erratic results. In addition, it was impossible to distinguish between serum ferric iron and hemoglobin ferrous iron in the sample. In the method of Zettner et al (4), ferric iron is freed by 1. 0 N hydrochloric acid and thioglycolate, chelated with bathophenanthroline, and the chelated metal extracted into methyl isohutyl ketone. This technic not only avoids extraction of hemoglobin iron, {{as long as it is}} not present in excessive amounts, hut the organic solvent used i...|$|E

This assay plus an indirect blocking ELISA and indirect ELISA were used to detect antibodies to the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) in 159 field-origin bovine sera. Results of these assays were compared with serum antibody titers measured by the serum neutralization (SN) test. Over a 56 -day period, the mean neutralization titers and the mean delta absorbance values for the blocking ELISA, on the same sera, showed similar declines. However, the calculated correlation coefficients between mean SN titer and mean absorbance value for the blocking ELISA of the individual sera ranged from - 0. 2 to - 0. 5 depending on the source of sera. Similar values were obtained whether using crude or purified viral antigen in the assays. Corresponding calculated correlation coefficients were generally higher for the indirect blocking ELISA or indirect ELISA than for the blocking ELISA. The blocking ELISA was between 70 and 64 % as sensitive as the serum neutralization test with a specificity of 100 or 90 % using the crude and purified viral antigen, respectively. The indirect blocking ELISA and indirect ELISA had similar calculated sensitivities and specificities. The blocking ELISA was faster to run than either of the other ELISA’s or the neutralization test. Further, nonspecific <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> was obviated because the blocking ELISA detects antibodies to 1 specific viral protein, the fusion protein. These {{studies suggest that the}} blocking ELISA should be useful as a serological test for BRSV antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan protozoon and an {{important}} cause of abortion in cattle worldwide (Dubey, 2003). Diagnosis is based on histopathologic and immunohistochemical evidences on the aborted fetus, {{but in many cases}} when fetal tissues are unavailable, it should be based on serology. Serological diagnosis has advanced considerably from the early development of IFAT (Dubey et al., 1988) and ELISA (Pare et al., 1995; Williams et al., 1997). Recently, we expressed the Nc-p 43 gene from a Korean strain of N. caninum (KBA- 2) in bacteria (Kim et al., 2000), and demonstrated that the antigenic domain of Nc-p 43 is localized in the C-terminal 2 / 3 parts of the molecule (Son et al., 2001). When the purified GST fused C-terminal 2 / 3 parts (P fragment) of Nc-p 43 was used as an antigen in ELISA, a high level of <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> was detected, possibly due to the non-specific binding of antibodies to GST. Therefore, we undertook to substitute GST with 6 × His, a relatively shorter and less characteristic tag, to express an antigen for use in ELISA. In addition, the antigenic N-terminal 2 / 3 fragment of SAG 1 from Toxoplasma gondii (Nam et al., 1996) was added to the plate as a control in an attempt to differentiate T. gondii, a neighboring apicomplexan infections.

40|$|Pyridylamination is {{a method}} of fluorescence-tagging {{oligosaccharides}} that enables efficient purification of each glycan from mixtures of biological materials and structural analyses of glycans by HPLC mapping techniques. A method to utilize purified pyridylamino (PA) -oligosaccharides immediately in interaction studies with specific binding proteins {{would be useful to}} study the biological functions of glycans. To achieve this, we prepared a neoglycoprotein by complexing periodate-oxidated PA-GlcNAc 2 and rabbit serum albumin (RSA) by reductive amination. Immunizing a rabbit with the neoglycoprotein, specific polyclonal antibodies, generated anti-PA-GlcNAc 2 -IgGs that were purified from the rabbit antiserum by using a protein A column and subsequently an RSA-Sepharose column to remove anti-RSA-IgGs. When the wells of a plastic plate were coated with anti-PA-GlcNAc 2 -IgGs and PA-GlcNAc 2 was added to the wells, PA-GlcNAc 2 was immobilized and concentration-dependently bound with biotinylated concanavalin A or Psathyrella velutina lectin (PVL) by ELISA. The IgGs were capable of immobilizing PA-N-glycans in the solid phas e. Using F(ab’) 2 fragments prepared from the IgGs as an immobilizing reagent for PA-GlcNAc 2 decreased the <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> in the ELISA, suggesting that N-glycans in the Fc region of the IgGs interfered with lectin binding. The effects of de-N-glycosylation of F(ab’) 2 suggested that the N-glycans which are reactive to Con A but not involved in the antigen recognition are present in the fragments. Quantitative studies using surface plasmon resonance indicated that the dissociation constant of the interaction between the F(ab’) 2 and PA-GlcNAc 2 was 6 x 10 - 6 M. The results demonstrate the utility of the IgGs and F(ab’) 2 as immobilizing reagents for PA-N-glycans. Our method provides a new approach to interaction analyses of PA-oligosaccharides...|$|E

Heat evolution and concentration are linearly related through the physiological range of serum uric acid concentrations and the method is free of interferences of the sort encountered with spectrophotometric methods.

Addftlonal Keyphrases: enzymic methods. intermethod comparison Theoretically, at least, calorimetry {{can be used to}} measure any chemical reaction that evolves or absorbs heat, including, of course, any enzymic reaction. Indeed, it has advantages over spectrophotometry when the product of a reaction has the same absorbance charac-teristics as the substrate, or constituents of the reaction mixture have a high <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> relative to the change induced by the reaction. When specific en-zymes have been used to measure the concentration of analytes in physiological specimens, calorimetry gen-erally allows quantification without separation from other components in the reaction mixture (1). From knowledge of the chemical reaction involved and the heats of formation of the products and reactants one can calculate the quantity of heat that should be produced by the reaction (see Appendix). Thus, it is possible to estimate the quantity of material actually present in a solution without having a pure standard at hand. A limitation of calorimetry has been its lack of sen-sitivity, which has necessitated either the use of a large sample volume or running the reaction for a long time.

40|$|We {{describe}} an automated procedure for determina-tion of a-amylase activity in serum or urine {{by use of}} a water-insoluble chromogenic starch substrate (commercially available). “AutoAnalyzer ” (Techni-con Corp.) equipment is used in which the sample and suspended substrate are introduced simulta-neously into the flow system. After incubation at 37 #{ 176 }Cthe water-soluble blue-starch breakdown products are filtered on-line across a cellulose nitrate mem-brane.

A number of reports have ap-peared in the recent literature describing adaptations of these methods for use in automated systems em-ploying conventional “AutoAnalyzer ” modules (3, 5). Although a number of the disadvantages inherent in these methods have been overcome in the automated procedures, problems of protein interference and nonspecific <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> necessitate the use of corrective blanks, which complicates operation and detracts from its ease and simplicity.

After the 2 times wash steps, Au NPs were re-dispersed in 10  mL of 0.02  M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.73). Using a peristatic pump, ten milliliters of Au NPs (3.4  ×  1012 particles/mL) in sodium bicarbonate buffer were steadily added at 7  μL/s to 2  μL of 20  mM SPDP solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4.73  ×  10 − 20 mol SPDP per Au NP) while {{the solution was}} stirred vigorously on ice.

When exposed to dithiothreitol (DTT), SPDP cleaves; this concept was used to quantify SPDP conjugation.

40|$|Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) is a {{material}} widely {{known for its}} inertness and excellent electrical properties. It is also transparent in the UV region and has a reasonable thermal conductivity. These properties make PTFE a suitable material for the separation capillary in capillary electrophoresis. Differences in the chemistry of the capillary wall compared to fused silica (FS) can make PTFE an interesting alternative to FS for some special applications. In this work, properties of a commercial PTFE capillary of approx. 100 μm i. d. were investigated, including the dependence of electroosmotic flow (EOF) on pH for unmodified and dynamically modified PTFE, optical properties, and practical aspects of use. The main problems encountered for the particular PTFE capillary {{used in this study}} were that it was mechanically too soft for routine usage and the crystallinity of the PTFE caused light scattering, leading to high <b>background</b> <b>absorbance</b> values in the low UV region. The profile of the EOF versus pH for bare PTFE surprisingly showed significantly negative EOF values at pH < 4. 2, with an EOF of − 30 × 10 − 9 m 2 V− 1 s− 1 being observed at pH 2. 5. This is likely to be caused by either impurities or additives of basic character in the PTFE, so that after their protonation at acidic pH they establish a positive charge on the capillary wall and create a negative EOF. A stable cationic semi-permanent coating of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC) could be established on the PTFE capillary and led to very similar magnitudes of EOF to those observed with FS. A hexadecanesulfonate coating produced a cathodic EOF of extremely high magnitude ranging between + 90 and + 110 × 10 − 9 m 2 s− 1 V− 1, which are values high enough to allow counter-EOF separation of high mobility inorganic anions. In addition, pH-independent micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC) separations could be easily realised due to hydrophobic adsorption of sodium dodecylsulfate (used to form the micelles) {{on the wall of the}} PTFE capillary. The use of polymers that would be mechanically more robust and optically transparent in the low-UV region should make such CE capillaries an interesting alternative to fused silica...|$|E
