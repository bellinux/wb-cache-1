500|$|In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC {{criticized the}} Walk of Fame, calling it [...] "just an {{attraction}} to lure tourists to theatres in the area." [...] She claimed {{that it would}} only honour Canadians with international impact, saying [...] "if it was truly for Canadians, then I {{think there would be}} more of a national bend to the whole thing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> I'm going to see a star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known-name here in Canada." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Esther Howard {{wrote in}} The Spectator, [...] "Surprisingly Ian Fleming's {{new book is}} a romantic one and, except for some early sex in England (rather well done, this) only just as nasty as is needed to show how {{absolutely}} thrilling it is for... the narrator to be rescued from both death and worse – than by a he-man like James Bond. Myself, I like the Daphne du Maurier touch and prefer it this way <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> his real fans will." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his college}} career, Barkley played the center position, despite being {{shorter than the}} average center. His height, officially listed as , is stated as [...] in his book, I May Be Wrong <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doubt</b> It. He {{became a member of}} Auburn's All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal {{percentage}} with 62.6%. He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC) Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team All-American selection. Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the Birmingham Post-Herald.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his return}} from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an {{instructor}} at No.1 Service Flying Training School, based at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, [...] "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough job and I take my hat off to the boys who {{have been doing it}} since war broke out... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if they have any chance of ever getting there—they are so valuable here." [...] In January 1942, he was posted to No.4 Squadron, which operated Wirraways in Canberra.|$|E
500|$|The {{view that}} {{a game of}} chess should end in a draw given best play prevails. Even if it cannot be proved, this {{assumption}} is considered [...] "safe" [...] by Rowson and [...] "logical" [...] by Adorján. Watson agrees that [...] "the proper result of a perfectly played chess game ... is a draw. ... Of course, I can't prove this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> {{that you can find}} a single strong player who would disagree. ... I remember Kasparov, after a last-round draw, explaining to the waiting reporters: 'Well, chess is a draw. World Champion Bobby Fischer thought that was almost definitely so..|$|E
500|$|Fischer was {{a master}} of playing with, and against, the Sicilian Defense. The next most common defense against Fischer's 1.e4 was the Caro-Kann Defense (1.e4 c6), against which Fischer had a good record. Fischer's worst record was against the French Defense (1.e4 e6), {{especially}} the [...] (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4). Fischer maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, [...] "Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and...Bxc3." [...] Later on Fischer said: [...] "I may yet be forced {{to admit that the}} Winawer is sound. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it! The defense is anti-positional and weakens the K-side." ...|$|E

He had come down to within twenty feet of the bottom, and there, clinging with one hand to a small ledge, and with his feet resting, precariously upon tiny bushes that grew from the solid face of the rock, he lowered the point of his long spear until it hung some six feet above the ground.|$|R
500|$|In 2000, Barkley {{wrote the}} {{foreword}} for Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly's book The Life of Reilly. In it, Barkley quipped, [...] "Of {{all the people}} in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys look real aerodynamic." [...] In 2002, Barkley released the book I May Be Wrong, <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doubt</b> It, which included editing and commentary by close friend Michael Wilbon. Three years later, Barkley released Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?, which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.|$|E
500|$|Parr's fame for {{severity}} {{spread a}} sort of panic through the city, especially among the mothers, who would sometimes interpose a remonstrance, which occasioned a ludicrous scene, but seldom availed the culprit, while the wiser were willing to leave their boys in his hands. Richard Twining, the tea merchant, however, was advised by his brother John to send his eldest son to Norwich, writing of Parr, [...] "I {{have been told that}} he flogs too much, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> those from whom I have heard it think any use of punishment too much". Parr's daily teaching was interrupted at midday when he sent a boy to the pastry-cook's across the road for a pie, which he ate by the schoolroom fire. On the resignation of his headship in 1785, historian Warren Derry comments, [...] "an object of terror was gone, but the glory of the place had gone with it".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of Scully's portrayal, noting [...] "Really, this works best as a Scully episode. I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump just about everything else that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, it works well enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review, saying: [...] "My bold {{prediction}} after last week's controversial episode of 'The Walking Dead' {{was that this}} week's would slow things way down {{in preparation for the}} grand Season 4 finale next Sunday evening. Well, this week's episode, titled 'Us,' was not exactly slow, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it will draw the crowds to the water cooler this morning either. There was plenty to keep our attention, but not quite enough to demand it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have read}} the poems with pleasure; but while I think they show {{a good deal of}} {{sensibility}} & poetic feeling, to certain homely states of emotion, I do not think they are sufficiently remarkable as literature to warrant any special attention. [...] That the author is a man of very amiable character, & that his love of his native island is very tender & beautiful is sufficiently obvious, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if these are enough to warrant us in claiming for him any attention beyond that which is due to a really admirable man who has preserved a simplicity of natural feeling that is rather too rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Talking of {{the sale}} of an estate of an ancient family, which {{was said to have}} been {{purchased}} much under its value by the confidential lawyer of that family, and it being mentioned that the sale would probably be set aside by a suit in equity, Dr Johnson said, 'I am very willing that this sale should be set aside, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> much whether the suit will be successful; for the argument for avoiding the sale is founded on vague and indeterminate principles, as that the price was too low, and that there was a great degree of confidence placed by the seller in the person who became the purchaser. Now, how low should a price be? or what degree of confidence should there be to make a bargain be set aside? a bargain, which is a wager of skill between man and man. If, indeed, any fraud can be proved, that will do.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert praised Susan Sarandon's {{performance}} {{in his review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times: [...] "I don't know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if the character would have worked without Sarandon's wonderful performance". In his review for Sports Illustrated, Steve Wulf wrote, [...] "It's a good movie and a damn good baseball movie". Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "The people associated with Bull Durham know the game ... and the firsthand experience shows in their easy command of the ballplayer's vernacular, in their feel for what goes through a batter's head when he digs in at the plate and in {{their knowledge of the}} secret ceremonies that take place on the mound". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "Costner's surly sexiness finally pays off here; abrading against Sarandon's earth-mama geniality and Robbins' rube egocentricity, Costner strikes sparks".|$|E

I had yet to learn something of Vane. He gave Ash a slow, wide-sweeping sidewheeler, that curved round over the plate. Ash always took a strike, so this did not matter. Then Vane used his deceptive change of pace, sending up a curve that just missed Ash's bat as he swung.|$|R
