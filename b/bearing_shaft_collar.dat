50|$|The <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> is a simple, yet important, machine {{component}} {{found in many}} power transmission applications, most notably motors and gearboxes. The collars are used as mechanical stops, locating components, and bearing faces. The simple design lends itself to easy installation. Many people will be familiar with <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> through using Meccano.|$|R
5000|$|The first mass-produced <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> {{were set}} screw collars and were used {{primarily}} on line shafting in early manufacturing mills. These early <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> were solid ring types, employing square-head set screws that protruded from the collar. Protruding screws {{proved to be}} a problem because they could catch on a worker's clothing while rotating on a shaft, and pull them into the machinery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shaft</b> <b>collars</b> saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} {{hex socket head}} set screws, and Hallowell patented a <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar was soon copied by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|R

50|$|At {{ground level}} beneath {{and around the}} {{headframe}} is the <b>Shaft</b> <b>Collar</b> (also called the Bank or Deck), which provides the foundation necessary to support {{the weight of the}} headframe and provides a means for men, materials and services to enter and exit the <b>shaft.</b> <b>Collars</b> are usually massive reinforced concrete structures with more than one level. If the shaft is used for mine ventilation, a plenum space or casing is incorporated into the collar to ensure the proper flow of air {{into and out of the}} mine.|$|R
40|$|Externally {{pressurized}} grooved gas thrust <b>bearings</b> for <b>shaft</b> {{systems were}} studied both numerically and experimentally. Three thrust bearings {{composed of a}} symmetric pair of rings facing a <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> were tested. The rings, with inner and outer diameters of 52 and 110 mm, respectively, are equipped with a polar array of eight holes, with a 0. 35 -mm diameter, distributed on a 65 -mm-diameter circumference. The influence of a circumferential groove situated in correspondence with the supply holes is discussed. In particular, two thrust bearings have a rectangular cross-sectional groove of 0. 7 -mm width and 10 - and 20 -lm depth. A numerical model based on Reynolds' equation is used to study thrust-bearing performance in relation to geometry (diameter of supply holes, clearance, and groove dimensions). A test rig is used to monitor thrust-bearing axial load capacity and stiffness, and evaluate damping and stability at different supply pressure rates. Experimental and numerical results are compared and discusse...|$|R
50|$|A further {{refinement}} of <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> {{is where a}} single bolt and nut surrounds the shaft. The bolt (exterior thread) has kerf cuts, making fingers, which are compressed onto the shaft as a nut is tightened over it. These are found on modern tripod legs and collets. If wrench-tightened, these can be very tight.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to design and fabricate a metrology tool for measuring the wear in micro-bearings. The critical component of the tool was a silicon test bed consisting of a <b>bearing</b> <b>shaft</b> and a set of microchannels to direct an air stream onto the fins of a micro-rotor assembled onto the <b>bearing</b> <b>shaft.</b> By driving the micro-rotor pneumatically, surface interactions between the bearing and the rotor can be studied over time. The silicon test bed mates to a custom aluminum chuck which has provisions for sealing the test bed and supplying air pressure from an external source. The silicon test bed was successfully fabricated by bulk micromachining using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). Test rotors were also fabricated using DRIE and manually placed onto the <b>bearing</b> <b>shaft</b> of the test bed. A glass cover slide, held in place by the aluminum chuck, was used to seal the top of the test bed. Test rotors were successfully rotated using a minimum input air pressure of 0. 5 psi...|$|R

50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} have {{a number}} of uses in the Steel industry. Thrust collars can be used on rolling mills, which makes changing the rolls much easier than other methods, and frees up crane time because only hand tools are required. Other MJTs are used on mill motors, <b>bearings,</b> <b>shaft</b> mounts, anchor bolts, and slitter knives.|$|R
50|$|Clamp-style <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> are {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with the set-screw collar. They come in one- and two-piece designs. Instead of protruding into the shaft, the screws act to compress the collar and lock it into place. The ease of use is maintained with this design and there is no shaft damage. Since the screws compress the collar, a uniform distribution of force is imposed on the shaft, leading to a holding power that is nearly twice that of set-screw collars.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of a lack}} of capital, {{the company}} was reconstituted in 1896 as the Brilliant Deep Levels Gold Mining Company. The shaft was then carried to 2,250 ft where the lode was intersected, but it was not payable. An {{explosion}} of dynamite of Christmas Day 1896 damaged the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> throwing 30 men out of work. An underlie shaft had been driven to 2,615 ft but no payable ore was found and operations were suspended in 1904 due to difficulty in ventilating the shafts.|$|R

The safety catch handle on the upper left of the Ringfeder is pulled out and turned 90 degrees, and then allowed to return into the upper detent on the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar.</b> This then allows the actuator handle {{on the right of}} the body to be lifted to the stop. This pulls the bolt upwards, and sets the automatic tripping function. The Ringfeder is now ready to be coupled.|$|R

30|$|The TC is {{a typical}} double {{overhung}} rotor with a steel turbine and an attached aluminum compressor impeller. That is, the turbine and compressor impellers are outboard of two <b>bearings.</b> The rotor <b>shaft,</b> FRB, <b>shaft</b> seal, thrust <b>collar,</b> <b>shaft</b> nut and other parts {{are included in the}} TC. All rotor components should be taken into account in the rotordynamic computation to investigate the rotor vibration response, such as the stability analysis and the frequency components in the waterfall plot. The compressor and turbine impellers are generally regarded as rigid disk to model. Due to its complex structure, the mass of rotating components, moment of inertia, and the center of gravity position can be obtained by using CAE 3 -dimensional software to model and calculate, and then add to the rotor-shaft regarded as a rigid disk.|$|R
40|$|An {{integral}} <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is popular}} for carrying higher specific load capacity, preventing misalignment defects and eliminating {{the risk of}} undesirable distortion of bearings, in compression to any other <b>bearings.</b> Integral <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> are used to reduced rotational friction and support, axial and radial loads which generate friction and increased temperature and stresses inside the bearings. If the generated heat cannot be properly removed from the inside bearing,the temperature might exceed certain limit. Due to which the bearing should be fail. That why I analyze heat flow, temperature distribution and stress in a bearing system, a typical integral <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> and its environment has been design and analyze the system using the famous finite elements tool ANSYS workbench 14. 0.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{innovative}} and useful of the collars is the two-piece clamping <b>collar.</b> Two-piece clamp-style <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> can be disassembled or installed in position without having to remove other components from the shaft. The two-piece design provides greater clamping force than a single piece clamp {{because all of the}} force is transferred directly into clamping the shaft. In single piece designs, the non-tightened side provides negative force as it must hold the collar open to allow it to be placed onto the shaft. The single tightener must work against this force as well as provide clamping force of its own.|$|R

Erosion of the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> has fully exposed one of the concrete footings of the headframe. A mullock dump is located immediately west of the headframe. East of the headframe is an open-sided engine shed of corrugated iron on a timber and steel frame, containing a winding engine on a brick mount and a large four- cylinder MAN diesel engine with a Vickers generator. The engine shed also {{contains a}} compressor and marble slab electrical switchboard. A security fence has recently been erected around the engine shed.|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s {{exploration}} drilling {{confirmed that the}} reef continued at least another 200 metres below the old workings. By 1991 the old Hart <b>Shaft</b> <b>collar</b> had been re-established and water pumped out to 160 metres deep. The project was suspended until 1992 when the mine's owners changed. Deep drilling resumed in 1993 to review the resource estimates and, from 1994, the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture has carried out drilling of the depth extension of the Tasmania Reef. A permanent stage pumping station 181 m below ground has been lowering {{the water in the}} shaft since August 1995. The permanent winder and head frame were completed in January 1996 and the shaft finished in late 1996. An ore treatment plant was built during the 1999/2000 financial year.|$|R

Extra timber and lagging was placed at the entrance of the mine shaft due to fears of falling rocks. Safety concerns also led to replacement of the old pulley-sheave with a new gin-wheel. Ladder ways and timbering in the shafts were substantially upgraded as most had split due to water logging. Most of the metal infrastructure such as pipe work and bolts had corroded due to their long period of saturation, and were replaced.|$|R
