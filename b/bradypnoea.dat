40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to evaluate the role of mu and delta opiate receptors in central cardiovascular control in the hypothalamic nucleus preopticus medialis of rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone. The highly selective mu opiate receptor agonist D-Ala 2 -MePhe 4 -Gly 5 -ol-enkephalin was extremely potent in eliciting hypotension and bradypnoea; tachycardia was elicited by a low dose (0. 064 nmol), but not by higher doses (0. 64 - 6. 4 nmol). Other selective mu receptor agonists (morphine sulphate, morphiceptin) caused tachycardia at lower doses (0. 64, 6. 4 nmol), hypotension and <b>bradypnoea</b> after the highest dose (64 nmol). The relatively selective delta receptor agonist D-Ala 2 -D-Leu 5 -enkephalin caused profound <b>bradypnoea</b> and hypotension at the high dose (64 nmol), tachycardia after the lowest dose (0. 64 nmol), but bradycardia was found during the hypotension induced by the high dose (64 nmol). All of the opiate/opioid effects were reversed by naloxone (0. 5 mg kg- 1, i. v.). It is concluded that mu receptors may mediate the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of opiates and opioid peptides in the nucleus preopticus medialis of the rat...|$|E
40|$|The {{respiratory}} response to microinjection of tachykinins and analogues into the commissural {{nucleus of the}} solitary tract (cNTS) of urethane-anaesthetized rats was investigated in the presence and absence of selective tachykinin NK 1, NK 2 and NK 3 antagonists (RP 67580, SR 48968 and SR 142801, respectively). All tachykinins, except for the selective NK 2 agonist, [Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10), increased tidal volume (VT). The rank potency order of naturally-occurring tachykinins was neurokinin A (NKA) ⩾substance P (SP) >>NKB, whereas the rank order for selective analogues was senktide⩾septide>> [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-SP>>[Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10). Septide (NK 1 -selective) and senktide (NK 3 -selective) were 22 fold more potent (pD 2 ∼ 12) at stimulating VT than SP (pD 2 ∼ 10. 5). Tachykinin agonists produced varying degrees of respiratory slowing, independent of changes in VT. At doses producing maximum stimulation of VT, agonists induced either a mild (< 10 breaths min− 1 decrease; SP and septide), moderate (10 – 25 breaths min− 1 decrease; NKA, NKB and [Sar 9,Met(O 2]-SP) or severe (∼ 40 breaths min− 1 decrease; senktide) <b>bradypnoea.</b> [Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10) produced a dose-dependent <b>bradypnoea</b> without affecting VT. RP 67580 significantly attenuated the VT response to SP (33 [*]pmol) and NKA (10 [*]pmol) but not NKB (100 [*]pmol). In the presence of RP 67580, the mild bradypnoeic response to NKB was significantly enhanced whereas SP and NKA induced a <b>bradypnoea</b> which was not observed {{in the absence of}} RP 67580. SR 48968 had no effect on the VT response to SP or NKB, markedly enhanced the VT response to NKA and completely blocked the bradypnoeic response to [Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10). Only SR 142801 attenuated the VT response to NKB. The present data suggest that all three tachykinin receptors (NK 1, NK 2 and NK 3) are present in the cNTS and are involved in the central control of respiration...|$|E

40|$|The {{respiratory}} response to microinjection of capsaicin and tachykinin receptor agonists into the commissural {{nucleus of the}} solitary tract (cNTS) was investigated in adult, urethane-anaesthetized rats which had been pretreated with capsaicin (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]s. c.) or vehicle (10 % Tween 80, 10 % ethanol in saline) as day 2 neonates. Microinjection of capsaicin (1 [*]nmol) into the cNTS of vehicle-pretreated rats, significantly reduced respiratory frequency (59 breaths[*]min− 1, preinjection control, 106 breaths[*]min− 1) without affecting tidal volume (VT). In capsaicin-pretreated rats, the capsaicin-induced <b>bradypnoea</b> was markedly attenuated (minimum frequency, 88 breaths[*]min− 1; control, 106 breaths[*]min− 1). In vehicle-pretreated rats, microinjection of substance[*]P (SP, 33 [*]pmol), neurokinin[*]A (NKA, 33 [*]pmol) and NKB (330 [*]pmol), and the selective NK 1 tachykinin receptor agonists, [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-SP (33 [*]pmol) and septide (10 [*]pmol), increased VT (maxima, 3. 60 – 3. 93 [*]ml[*]kg− 1) compared with preinjection control (2. 82 [*]ml[*]kg− 1), without affecting frequency. The selective NK 3 agonist senktide (10 [*]pmol) also increased VT (3. 93 [*]ml[*]kg− 1) which {{was accompanied by a}} <b>bradypnoea</b> (− 25 breaths[*]min− 1). The selective NK 2 agonist, [Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10) (330 [*]pmol) increased VT slightly but significantly decreased frequency (− 12 breaths[*]min− 1). In capsaicin-pretreated rats, VT responses to SP and [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-SP were increased whereas the response to septide was abolished. Both the VT and bradypnoeic responses to senktide and [Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10) were significantly enhanced. These results show that neonatal capsaicin administration markedly reduces the {{respiratory response}} to microinjection of capsaicin into the cNTS. The destruction of capsaicin-sensitive afferents appears to sensitize the NTS to SP, NKB, [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-SP, senktide and [Nle 10]-NKA(4 - 10). Moreover, the loss of septide responsiveness in capsaicin-pretreated rats, suggests that ‘septide-sensitive' NK 1 receptors may be located on the central terminals of afferent neurons...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in cats anaesthetized with chloralose, (a) to examine the effect on blood pressure, heart rate and {{respiratory}} frequency produced by topical application of leptazol, nicotine and sodium pentobarbitone to the ventral surface of the medulla at an area around the rootlets of the XII cranial nerve, and (b) to study the role of this area in some cardiovascular reflexes. Leptazol applied uni- or bilaterally to this area produced hypotension, bradycardia and <b>bradypnoea.</b> The area from which leptazol produced these effects was localized 3 - 6 mm lateral to the mid line and 5 - 9 mm caudal to the lower border of the trapezoid bodies. When comparing the effects of leptazol and nicotine applied to this area {{it was found that}} in concentrations that produced similar falls in arterial blood pressure and heart rate leptazol produced a much stronger <b>bradypnoea</b> than nicotine. The hypotension produced by leptazol was mainly due to inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor tone since it was little affected by section of the vagi and by atropine given intravenously. Bilateral application of sodium pentobarbitone produced a small hypertension, tachycardia and pronounced tachypnoea. Unilateral application of sodium pentobarbitone had no effect by itself but inhibited the effects of leptazol applied to the same site. Cardiovascular reflexes produced by sinus nerve stimulation, by increased sinus pressure or by injections of veratridine into a vein or into the left ventricle of the heart were potentiated by topical application of leptazol to the ventral surface and depressed by the topical application of sodium pentobarbitone. The chemoreceptor reflex, produced by retrograde injections of lobeline into the lingual artery, was partially affected by topical application of sodium pentobarbitone: the evoked bradycardia was attenuated but the tachypnoea and hypertension were not affected. These results suggest that this medullary area on the ventral surface of the medulla {{plays an important role in}} normal cardiovascular regulation...|$|E
40|$|Vital signs can {{indicate}} patient deterioration {{prior to}} adverse {{events such as}} cardiac arrest, emergency admission to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU), or death. However, many adverse events occur in wards outside the ICU where the level of care and the frequency of patient monitoring are lower than in the ICU. This thesis describes models for detection of deterioration in acutely ill patients in two environments: a step-down unit in which patients recovering from an ICU stay are continuously monitored, and a general ward where patients are intermittently monitored following upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Existing data fusion models for classification of vital signs depend on a threshold which defines a “region of normality”. <b>Bradypnoea</b> (low breathing rate) and bradycardia (low heart rate) are relatively rare, and so these two types of abnormalities tend to be misclassified by existing methods. In this thesis, techniques for selecting a threshold are described, such that the classification of vital-sign data is improved. In particular, the proposed approach reduces the misclassification of bradycardia and <b>bradypnoea</b> events, and indicates the type of abnormality associated with the deterioration in a patient’s vital signs. Patients recovering from upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery have a high risk of emergency admission to the ICU. At present in the UK, most intermediate and general wards outside the ICU depend on intermittent, manual monitoring using track-and-trigger systems. Both manual and automated patient monitoring systems are reported to have high false alert rates. The models described in this thesis take into account the low monitoring frequency in the upper GI ward, such that the false alert rate is reduced. In addition to accuracy, early detection of deterioration is a highly desirable feature in patient monitoring systems. The models proposed in this thesis generate alerts for patients earlier than the early warning systems which are currently in use in hospitals in the UK. The improvements to existing models proposed in this thesis could be applied to continuous and intermittently acquired vital-sign data from other clinical environments. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
40|$|Induced {{hypothermia}} after {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} provides organ protection {{and is currently}} considered standard of care in clinical practice. An increasing number of reports indicate that induced hypothermia is also beneficial in other conditions of hypoxia-induced organ injury, including brain injury, intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury and acute lung injury. The mechanism of the protective effect {{is thought to be}} caused by a reduction in metabolism. A hibernation-like state, characterised by hypothermia, <b>bradypnoea</b> and a reduction in metabolic rate, was induced in animals that normally do not hibernate, after inhalation of hydrogen sulphide. This state was termed a 'suspended animation-like state'. In critically ill patients, an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response is common, which often results in multiple organ injury. Inducing a hypometabolic state during critical illness may limit organ injury by reducing oxygen consumption, constituting a fascinating new therapeutic perspective for the treatment of critically ill patients. In this manuscript, we describe mitochondrial dysfunction during critical illness and preclinical data that suggest a potential therapeutic possibility of lowering metabolism. In addition, we discuss issues that warrant further research before clinical applicabilit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRett {{syndrome}} is a neurodevelopmental disease accompanied by complex, disabling symptoms, including breathing symptoms. Because Rett {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in the transcriptional repressor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP 2), Mecp 2 -deficient mice have been generated as experimental model. Males of Mecp 2 -deficient mice (Mecp 2 (-/y)) breathe normally at birth but show abnormal respiratory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia from postnatal day 25 (P 25). After P 30, Mecp 2 (-/y) mice develop breathing symptoms reminiscent of Rett syndrome, aggravating until premature death at around P 60. Using plethysmography, we analyzed the sighs and the post-sigh breathing pattern of unrestrained wild type male mice (WT) and Mecp 2 (-/y) mice from P 15 to P 60. Sighs are spontaneous large inspirations known to prevent lung atelectasis and to improve alveolar oxygenation. However, Mecp 2 (-/y) mice show early abnormalities of post-sigh breathing, with long-lasting post-sigh apnoeas, reduced tidal volume when eupnoea resumes and lack of post-sigh <b>bradypnoea</b> which develop from P 15, aggravate with age and possibly contribute to breathing symptoms to come...|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} {{organization of the}} ventral respiratory group (VRG) was examined with respect to generation of respiratory rhythm (breathing frequency) versus control of the respiratory motor pattern on individual nerves. In urethane-anaesthetized, neuromuscularly blocked and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and respiratory motor outputs (phrenic, pharyngeal branch of the vagus, or superior laryngeal nerves) were recorded. The VRG organization was mapped systematically using injections of the excitatory amino acid dl-homocysteic acid (DLH; 5 – 20 mm, 2 – 6 nl) from single- or double-barrel pipettes at 100 – 200 μm intervals between the facial nucleus and the calamus scriptorius. Recording of respiratory neurons through the injection pipette ensured that the pipette was located within the VRG. At {{the end of each}} experiment, the injection pipette was used to make an electrical lesion, thereby marking the electrode position for subsequent histological reconstruction of injection sites. Four rostrocaudal regions were identified: (1) a rostral <b>bradypnoea</b> area, {{at the level of the}} Bötzinger complex, in which respiratory rhythm slowed and ABP increased, (2) a tachypnoea/dysrhythmia area, at the level of the preBötzinger complex, in which breathing rate either increased or became irregular, with little or no change in ABP, (3) a caudal <b>bradypnoea</b> area at the level of the anterior part of the rostral VRG in which ABP decreased and (4) a caudal ‘no effect’ region in the posterior part of the rostral VRG. The peak amplitude of phrenic nerve activity decreased with injections into all three rostral regions. Changes in respiratory rhythm were associated with opposite changes in inspiratory (TI) and expiratory (TE) durations after injections into either the Bötzinger complex or anterior rostral VRG, while both TI and TE decreased after injections into the preBötzinger complex. Effects on selected cranial nerves were similar to those on the phrenic nerve except that tonic activity was elicited on the superior larygneal nerve ipsilateral to injections in the Bötzinger complex and on the pharyngeal branch of the vagus ipsilateral to injections in the preBötzinger complex. These data reinforce the subdivision of the VRG into functionally distinct compartments and suggest that a further subdivision of the rostral VRG is warranted. They also suggest that region-specific influences, especially on the pattern of cranial motor discharge, can be used to assist the identification of recording sites within the VRG. However, the postulated clear functional separation of rhythm- versus pattern-generating regions was not supported...|$|E
40|$|The expiratory <b>bradypnoea</b> {{indicative}} of upper airway irritation in mice was evaluated {{during a period}} of 60 min of nasal exposure to methyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, ethyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, isopropyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate and 2 -methoxyethyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate vapors using nose only expo-sure. Irritation of the upper respiratory tract caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the respiratory rate. The maximum effect occurred within the first 10 min of exposure and was followed by a drop-off in the response during the remainder of the exposure period. The airborne concentration resulting in a 50 % decrease in the respiratory rate of mice (RD 50) was calculated for each chemical. The results show that the four chemicals had similar irritant potencies. The RD 50 values of methyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, ethyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, isopropyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate and 2 -methoxyethyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate were 1. 4, 0. 7, 0. 6 and 1. 0 p. p. m. Tentative estimates of threshold limit values showed that 0. 1 RD 50 was closer to the values recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists for methyl- and ethyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate than 0. 03 RD 50. On the basis of a threshold limit value for short-term exposure limit (TLV STEL) equal to 0. 1 RD 50, the TLV STELs for the four cyanoacrylates should not exceed 0. 1 or 0. 2 p. p. m...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{incidence}} and pattern of cardiac arrhythmias and other abnormalities in the early posttraumatic period of experimental cardiac contusion and to assess their contribution to death {{and the development of}} posttraumat-ic myocardial dysfunction. Materials and methods: experiments were carried out on non-inbred albino male rats anesthetized with sodium thiopental. An electrocardiogram, respiration rate, and left carotid blood pressure were recorded in the direct fashion. Cardiac contusion was reproduced by an original device that imitated a blow of the steering wheel to the anterior chest, as that observed when a moving car clashed against an obstacle. Some animals were traumatized after preadministration of atropine sulfate. Results: sinus bradycardia accompanied by <b>bradypnoea</b> or short-term apnoea and lowered blood pressure is a compulsory and persistent ECG abnormality. Preinjection of atropine significantly prevents the occurrence of these changes and points to the likely reflectory mechanism of their development. Other ECG abnormalities (heterotopic rhythms, premature beats, conduction blockade, terminal ventricular complex changes, etc.) are encountered in a variety of combinations, including those among which typical changes that are undetectable, are diverse, short-term, and labile. Among them, there are virtually no hemodynamic and potentially fatal arrhythmias. Conclusion: in experimental isolated cardiac contusion, the pattern of cardiac arrhythmias differs from that observed in the inpatient setting. Cardiac arrhythmias and other ECG abnormalities do not make a considerable contribution to a mortality rate under the conditions of this experiment since there are no hemodynamic ones.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} injections of alfentanil, fentanyl, phenoperidine or morphine on respiratory and peak inspiratory air flow rate, the diaphragm electromyogram (EMG), the activity recorded extracellularly from respiratory neurones {{located in the}} ventral respiratory group and the cardiovascular system were examined in anaesthetized rats. Alfentanil produced dose-dependent changes in peripheral and central respiratory parameters, which were prevented by naloxone pretreatment. Minimal effects were produced on the cardiovascular system. The <b>bradypnoea</b> was principally due to a prolongation of the inspiratory phase and {{was accompanied by a}} comparable decrease in the peak inspiratory air flow rate. Alfentanil prolonged the discharge duration of inspiratory neurones such that it still maintained a strict phase correlation with the diaphragm EMG, but changes in firing frequency were inconsistent and negligible. The action on expiratory neuronal discharge was analogous to that on inspiratory neuronal discharge but delayed in onset. Hypotension produced by morphine limited the dose used but the respiratory responses to morphine and other selected narcotic analgesics were otherwise similar to that of alfentanil, differing mainly in time-course and magnitude. From the respiratory parameters assessed, the order of duration of effect was morphine greater than phenoperidine greater than fentanyl greater than alfentanil and the relative potencies were 0. 1, 0. 5, 2. 5 and 1 respectively. The selective prolongation of inspiration and the immediate action on inspiratory neurones suggests that systemically administered narcotic analgesics may alter the mechanisms within the central respiratory rhythm generator which determine the cessation of inspiration...|$|E
40|$|We audited and {{analysed}} {{the adverse}} effects and safety of postoperative pain management on 2509 consecutive patients under care of the Acute Pain Service at a tertiary referral teaching hospital over a 32 -month period. Our standard respiratory monitoring consisted of continuous pulse oximetry, hourly respiratory rate counting, sedation scoring and intermittent arterial blood gas sampling. This protocol was reliable and detected six episodes of <b>bradypnoea,</b> 13 of hypercapnia and 23 of oxygen desaturation occurring in 39 patients (1. 8 % of all spontaneously breathing patients). Two patients required naloxone injection and none had long-term sequelae, Hypotension due to epidural bupivacaine 0. 0625 % and fentanyl 3. 3 μg. ml- 1 infusion occurred in four patients (1. 2 %), all with a sensory block higher than T 5. They readily responded to fluid infusion and ephedrine (two patients). Postoperative nausea or vomiting occurred in 723 (28. 8 %) and 380 (15. 1 %) patients, respectively. Odds ratio analysis showed that the risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting were: female gender, gynaecological operations, nongeriatric patients and systemic analgesia. Postoperative nausea and vomiting decreased analgesic efficacy by discouraging the use of patient-controlled analgesia and was regarded as equally distressing as pain. Other side-effects included: pruritus in 182 patients; dizziness in 333 and lower limb weakness in 73 (21. 2 % of patients receiving epidural local anaesthetics). It is concluded that a standard monitoring and management protocol, an experienced nursing team and reliable Acute Pain Service coverage is mandatory for the safe use of modern analgesic techniques. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Somatostatin (SST) neurons in the ventral {{respiratory}} column (VRC) {{are essential}} for the generation of normal breathing. Little {{is known about the}} neuromodulatory role of SST on ventral respiratory neurons other than that local administration induces apnoea. Here, we describe the cardiorespiratory effects of microinjecting SST into the preBötzinger and Bötzinger complexes which together elaborate a normal inspiratory augmenting and expiratory respiratory pattern, and on spinally projecting respiratory subnuclei (rostral ventral respiratory group; rVRG). Microinjections (20 – 50 nl) of SST (0. 15, 0. 45, 1. 5 mM) were made into respiratory subnuclei of urethane-anaesthetized, paralysed, vagotomized and artificially ventilated Sprague–Dawley rats (n= 46). Unilateral microinjection of SST into the Bötzinger complex converted the augmenting activity of phrenic nerve discharge into a square-wave apneustic pattern associated with a lengthening of inspiratory period and shortening of expiratory time. Following bilateral microinjection the apneusis became pronounced and was associated with a dramatic variability in inspiratory duration. Microinjection of SST into the Bötzinger complex also abolished the post-inspiratory (post-I) motor activity normally observed in vagal and sympathetic nerves. In the preBötzinger complex SST caused <b>bradypnoea</b> and with increasing dose, apnoea. In the rVRG SST reduced phrenic nerve amplitude, eventually causing apnoea. In conclusion, SST powerfully inhibits respiratory neurons throughout the VRC. Of particular interest is the finding that chemical inhibition of the Bötzinger complex with SST ablates the post-I activity that is normally seen in respiratory activity and leads to apneusis. This loss of post-I activity is a unique feature of inhibition with SST and is not seen following inhibition with other agents such as galanin, GABA and endomorphin. The effect seen on post-I activity is similar to the effect of inhibiting the Kölliker–Fuse nucleus in the pons. The mechanism by which SST exerts this effect on Bötzinger neurons remains to be determined. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{data from}} 1233 Chinese patients {{of a wide}} age range who received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) intravenous morphine for postoperative pain relief {{during the period from}} January 1992 to May 1995. The analgesic regimen was standardized as follows: PCA bolus 1 to 1. 5 mg; lock-out interval 5 minutes; one-hour maximum dose 0. 075 to 0. 1 mg. kg- 1 and background infusion 0 or 0. 5 mg. h- 1. Most patients underwent major surgery that was broadly subclassified according to the anatomical area involved. The median verbal numerical rating scales of pain (0 to 10) at rest and while coughing for the first, second and third 24 hours were 3. 0 / 5. 0, 1. 5 / 4, 0 and 0 / 3, 0 respectively and the corresponding demand to delivery ratios were 2. 8 ± 2. 9, 2. 6 ± 2. 4 and 2. 4 ± 2. 6. The overall morphine consumptions in 1004 of these Chinese patients were 27. 5 ± 16. 8, 178 ± 16, 1 and 18. 1 ± 21. 0 μg. kg- 1. h- 1 during the first 16, 17 to 41 and 42 to 66 postoperative hours respectively. These figures were the same as for Caucasian patients managed in the same institution. Morphine consumption was significantly higher following thoracic, upper abdominal and spinal surgery. Also it was higher in patients younger than 65 years, males, cigarette smokers and those with ASA physical status I or II. The commonest side-effects were nausea (34. 5 %) and vomiting (18. 2 %). <b>Bradypnoea</b> and oxygen desaturation occurred in 0. 5 % and 1. 6 % respectively. All cases were promptly detected and managed with no adverse outcomes. Most patients were satisfied (76. 7 % ranked 'good') with their postoperative analgesia. The commonest reasons for dissatisfaction were inadequate pain relief, nausea and reluctance to selfcontrol analgesic administration. It is concluded that PCA with intravenous morphine is effective and safe as a routine postoperative technique for Chinese surgical patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

No que se refere ao sistema digestivo, foram evidenciados, principalmente, hipomotilidade/atonia intestinal, edema dos lábios, distensão abdominal, deitar e levantar com freqüência, rolar no solo, olhar para o flanco, gemer e impactação do intestino grosso. Observaram-se ainda taquicardia, aumento do tempo de preenchimento capilar e mucosas congestas, estridor, taquipnéia, dispnéia, secreção nasal, bradipnéia e respiração abdominal. Todos os três casos naturais ocorreram após aspersão do amitraz. Os primeiros sintomas foram observados 2 e 3 dias após o banho. A evolução foi de 6, 7 e 17 dias. Um animal manifestou a maioria dos sinais referentes ao sistema nervoso observados nos experimentos, com exceção dos sinais de cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar, bocejos, lábios flácidos e exposição do pênis. Outro animal, intoxicado espontaneamente, manifestou somente sintomas digestivos como rolar, “patear”, hipomotilidade/atonia intestinal e impactação do intestino grosso. Um terceiro animal, inicialmente manifestou sintomas digestivos caracterizados por patear, rolar, atonia intestinal e impactação do intestino grosso, com conseqüente desenvolvimento de laminite; na fase final exibiu acentuada sintomatologia nervosa mostrando compressão da cabeça contra obstáculos, incoordenação motora com cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar e relutância em se movimentar. Baseados no quadro clínico observado, são sugeridos possíveis locais de lesão no sistema nervoso. Poisoning by amitraz was experimentally {{reproduced in}} 17 horses and a donkey. First symptoms were observed between 15 min. and 2 h 5 min. after oral administration, and between 6 h 28 min. and 8 h 38 min. after spraying with amitraz. The course of poisoning after oral administration was 4 to 9 days, and after spraying 5 to 6 days. Death of experimental animals occurred only after oral administration. One animal was euthanized after spraying. Doses of 5. 5 mg/kg (1 administration), 5. 8 mg/kg (2 administrations) and doses which varied between 7. 2 and 36. 4 mg/kg (5 administrations) were used when amitraz {{was given by}} mouth, all causing symptoms of poisoning. When the administration of amitraz was by spraying, poisoning was reproduced with solutions of 0. 1 and 0. 2 %. Regarding the nervous system, the main signs observed were recumbency, somnolence, palpebral and auricular ptosis, difficulties in apprehension, chewing and swallowing of food, dragging of the hooves, exposure of the penis, diminished or absent cutaneous sensibility, instability, abduction of the legs, lowering of the head, incoordination, jawning, labial flacity, exposure of the tongue, crossing of the legs when walking, diminished postural response after crossing or abducting the legs, diminished/absent reflex of the upper lip, palatal, tongue, flexor and swallowing reflex, diminished auricular, palpebral and menace reflex. The ambulatory response was diminished when tested by walking in circles of small radius. Regarding the digestive system, the signs were mainly intestinal hypomotility/atony, edema of the lips, abdominal distention, frequent lying down and standing up, rolling on the ground, looking at the flancs, groaning and impaction of the large bowel. Regarding the circulatory system, the main clinical signs were tachycardia, increase of the refilling time of capillaries, congested mucosa and splitting of the cardiac sounds. Regarding the respiratory system, stridor, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, nasal discharge, <b>bradypnoea</b> and abdominal respiration was observed. Beside these signs, there were alterations of the general condition, as apathy and hypothermia. All natural cases occurred after spraying with amitraz. First symptoms were seen 2 to 3 days after the application of amitraz. The course was 6, 7 and 17 days. One animal showed mainly the nervous signs {{as seen in the}} experiments, with exception of the signs of crossing the legs when walking, yawning and exposure of the penis. Another animal had only digestive symptoms as rolling, pawing, intestinal hypomotility/atony and impaction of the large bowel. A third animal initially showed digestive symptoms characterized by pawing, rolling, intestinal atony and impaction of the large bowel, followed by laminitis; in the final stage this animal showed severe nervous signs as pressing the head against obstacles, incoordination with crossing the legs when walking and reluctance to move. Possible location of lesions in the nervous system according to the clinical signs are suggested...|$|E
