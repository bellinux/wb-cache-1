25|$|On old and lower-cost CRT {{oscilloscopes}} the graticule is a {{sheet of}} plastic, often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps {{at the edge of}} the graticule. The lamps had a <b>brightness</b> <b>control.</b> Higher-cost instruments have the graticule marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate parallax errors; better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings. (Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital oscilloscopes, however, generate the graticule markings on the display in the same way as the trace.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} {{are often}} based on the SMPS topology, first rectifying the input power and then chopping it at a high frequency. Advanced electronic ballasts may allow dimming via pulse-width modulation or via changing the frequency to a higher value. Ballasts incorporating a microcontroller (digital ballasts) may offer remote control and monitoring via networks such as LonWorks, DALI, DMX512, DSI or simple analog control using a 0-10V DC <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> signal. Systems with remote control of light level [...] via a wireless mesh network have been introduced.|$|E
50|$|In {{televisions}} {{with automatic}} <b>brightness</b> <b>control,</b> the on-mode power consumption {{is reduced by}} 5% if the following conditions are fulfilled when the television {{is placed on the}} market:(a)the luminance of the television in the home-mode or the on-mode condition as set by the supplier, is automatically reduced between an ambient light intensity of at least 20 lux and 0 lux;(b)the automatic <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> is activated in the home-mode condition or the on-mode condition of the television as set by the supplier.|$|E
50|$|Under {{moonlight}} {{or lower}} conditions, the AN/PVS-4 {{can be used}} without the adaptor and the ABC or Automatic <b>Brightness</b> <b>Controls</b> will reduce the gain, although the image may be too bright for the reticle to show correctly.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{displays}} {{have replaced}} many mechanical displays in aircraft. The "glass" cockpit continues to advance. Electronic displays required adjustment of luminance (often {{referred to as}} brightness) and contrast as the ambient environment changes. Requiring pilots to manually <b>control</b> <b>brightness</b> creates additional pilot workload. Instead, automatic <b>brightness</b> <b>controls</b> (ABCs) have been suggested. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to summarize a research plan for the development of an ABC for military aircraft...|$|R

2500|$|... iOS 7 {{introduced}} the Control Center, a menu that users can access by swiping {{up from the}} bottom of the screen, providing access to frequently used settings such as Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb Mode, and Rotation Lock. There is a slider for adjusting screen <b>brightness,</b> <b>controls</b> for music playback, along with a volume slider. A Flashlight toggle is also available, as is an icon for quickly accessing the camera.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} system does run {{more slowly than}} on the 6230, possibly due to the increased processor drain of the higher resolution screen. Nokia also removed several options from menus, such as: <b>brightness</b> <b>control,</b> {{and the ability to}} automatically overwrite text messages in the Inbox/Sent Folders. These changes have brought widespread complaints.|$|E
50|$|These laptops are {{available}} with most major Linux distributions, including Fedora, RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, and SuSE. Significant improvements to stock Linux distributions come from the empkernel and a carefully configured /etc directory. Supported features include APM and ACPI suspend and hibernate support, CPU throttling, LCD backlight <b>brightness</b> <b>control,</b> wireless, and generally full support of the hardware under Linux.|$|E
5000|$|The EEE PC900 has a {{tendency}} for the display to fail with black blobs due to air leakage, this is repairable but depending on exact replacement unit sometimes needs the 8 pin E2PROM moved from the old display to the new one and a single track linked to regain picture and <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> after the new one is fitted.|$|E
500|$|The Yehudi project {{therefore}} used forward-pointing lamps {{mounted in}} the aircraft's nose and the leading edges of the wings, or suspended beneath the wings, their <b>brightness</b> <b>controlled</b> by a circuit containing a pair of photocells to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. [...] One photocell pointed at the sky, the other at an auxiliary lamp; the circuit adjusted lamp brightness to make the output from the two photocells equal. It was trialled in Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945.|$|R

Users {{can share}} files with the iPhone 5 onwards, the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPad (4th generation) onwards, or iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards. The {{operating}} system also adds Control Center, a control panel accessed by swiping {{up from the}} bottom of the screen. Control Center contains a number of commonly used functions, such as volume and <b>brightness</b> <b>controls,</b> along with toggles for enabling Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane mode, and for using the rear camera's flash LED as a flashlight.|$|R

50|$|Camera's captures include {{location}} information if the user provides the app {{permission to use}} it. Additional settings included in the app include time delay, zooming, focus control, sensitivity control, white balance control, shutter speed control, <b>brightness</b> <b>control,</b> and a toggle for switching between different cameras. For instance, most Windows phones and tablets have both front- and rear-facing cameras, so Cameraâ€™s switch button toggles between the two options.|$|E
5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, modern LCD {{monitors}} are not flicker free, {{since most of}} them use pulse-width modulation (PWM) for <b>brightness</b> <b>control.</b> As the brightness setting is lowered, the flicker becomes more noticeable, since the period when the backlight is active in each PWM duty cycle shortens. The problem is much more pronounced on modern LED backlit monitors, because LED backlight reacts faster to changes in current.|$|E
50|$|In some analog color CRT displays, {{starting}} in 1956, the <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> signal (luminance) is fed to the cathode connections {{of the electron}} guns, and the color difference signals (chrominance signals) are fed to the control grids connections. This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later solid state designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.|$|E
50|$|While Kodak instant {{films have}} been discontinued, Fuji's instant film {{available}} in Japan since the 1980s {{is very similar}} to Kodak's. The pictures are the same size, the cartridge is almost the same, with some easy plastic modifications; the Fuji Fotorama series film can be made to fit. It was closest to the Kodak with the ISO at 160, many of the camera's <b>brightness</b> <b>controls</b> can be adjusted to work with the different ISO; However, the FI-10 series was discontinued in the 1990s. The faster ISO 800 instant films will work as well but would require the use of a filter either on the film cartridge or lens.|$|R
25|$|The Control Center {{redesign}} unifies {{its pages}} and {{allows users to}} 3D Touch (or long press on devices without 3D Touch) buttons for more options.

5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra <b>brightness.</b> In <b>controlled</b> experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|R
50|$|SLR670a merges {{the best}} {{functions}} and features of SX-70 and SLR680 into a sleek, stylish body. It works with both 600 film and SX-70 film so no more neutral-density filter needed when shooting. The high ISO performance {{coupled with an}} advanced shutter and <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> gives better results in lower lighting situations {{without the use of}} flash. When using with ISO 160 film, the lighten/darken wheel can be turned to lighten.|$|E
5000|$|Another upgrade helped reject unsynchronized pulses, supplanting the two-layer display. This device, the [...] "Anti-Jamming Black-Out" [...] unit, AJBO, fed the Y-axis signal into a {{delay and}} then into the <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> of the CRT. Short pulses that {{appeared}} and disappeared were muted, disappearing from the display. Similar techniques using acoustic delay lines, both for jamming reduction and filtering out noise, became common on many radar units during the war.|$|E
50|$|In August 2014, Vukicevic and Hu founded Meural {{with the}} mission of facilitating art {{discovery}} and expression. The project was incubated out of Con Artist, an art collective, where {{they were able to}} get early feedback straight from artists. The first 12 months of the operation was dedicated to research and development, including: sourcing the LCD panel, developing the ambient light sensor <b>brightness</b> <b>control,</b> creating gesture control language, and designing the digital frames.|$|E
5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt.

5|$|The third version {{featured}} a photocell {{to measure the}} brightness of the night sky and the ship's side; the projectors' <b>brightness</b> was automatically <b>controlled</b> to balance out the difference. It was tested in September 1941 on the corvette HMCS Kamloops.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of in-vitro methods for the occlusal dentine caries diagnosis. Thirty-eight sites were evaluated on third molars without macroscopic carious cavitation in adult individuals from the city of Barretos (SP), Brazil. Visual inspection (VI), endoscopic evaluation (AcuCam), visual inspection and blunt-tipped exploratory probes (Tactile), conventional bite-wing radiographs (CR), direct bite-wing digital radiograph (DR), and direct digital radiograph with contrast and <b>brightness</b> <b>controled</b> (DRbc) were used by five observers. In order to validate the data, the teeth were sectioned and histologically evaluated. The average sensitivity and specificity values of the methods were respectively: 0, 25, 0, 96 (VI); 0, 15, 0, 92 (AcuCam); 0, 17, 0, 95 (Tactile); 0, 45, 0, 73 (CR); 0, 33, 0, 80 (DR) and 0, 35, 0, 84 (DRbc), the effectiveness of clinical methods (VI, AcuCam and Tactile) as well as that of radiographic methods (CR, DR and DRbc) were comparatively similar. The clinical methods presented a smaller number of false-positive diagnosis than the radiographic methods. It was concluded that visual inspection is an important diagnostic method; conventional bite-wing and digital radiography aid the diagnosis and are equally efficient to diagnose carious lesions in the dentine of teeth without visible cavitation...|$|R
50|$|In a {{monochrome}} receiver the {{luminance signal}} is amplified {{to drive the}} control grid in the electron gun of the CRT.
