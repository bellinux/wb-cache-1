5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> on the ruins of its gargantuan international <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{novelty of}} this paper is the {{comparative}} analysis of the Romanian and Icelandic <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> The study results reveal that despite the fact that Romania and Iceland are two different worlds, there are several similarities between the <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of these countries. They include a late development of <b>banking</b> <b>systems,</b> foreigners contributing a great deal {{to the development of the}} <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> in the early stage of evolution. After the Second World War until the 1990 s specialized banks operated in both countries. The <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of both countries prior to the 1990 s were dominated by politics. Liberalization of banking and capital occurred both in Romania and Iceland after 1990; the bank privatization process took place during a similar period (1999 - 2006, Romania; 1998 - 2002, Iceland). Before privatization, banks in both countries lacked experience in a new banking “arena”. The global financial crisis greatly affected the two <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite similarities, the evolution of the two <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> was also marked by differences, notably the ownership origin of banks after privatization (foreign dominance in Romania; domestic owners in Iceland) and different business models developed by banks in the pre-crisis period...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{identification}} of common and distinctive regularities of development of <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> with {{different levels of development}} of economy through study of the most important macro-economic and financial indicators. The article uses instruments of the applied statistics. The study is based on comparison of mean values of indicators in two groups of countries (countries {{with a high level of}} income and countries with a medium level of income), each of which is divided into two sub-groups based on whether there was banking crisis in 2008 or not. In the result of the study the article shows that there are both common and distinctive features of development of <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of countries with different levels of economic development. Thus, a typical scenario, characteristic for countries with developed economy that had banking crisis in 2008, includes availability of a relatively large-scale crediting of the economy under conditions of relatively low rates of economic growth and close connections of the national <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> with <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of other countries. Development of <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of developing countries during the pre-crisis period is characterised with the following specific features: relatively high rates of growth of scales of crediting of the economy and high rates of economic growth under conditions of use of significant volumes of resources, borrowed in financial markets, and close connection of the national <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> with <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of other countries. The study allows a more efficient use of experience of states with developed economy, since the described results give a possibility to adjust experience of other states, taking into account characteristic features of <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of developing countries. Also the study identified states, experience of which should be studied. The conducted analysis of interrelations of indicators could be used for building models of assessment of sustainability of <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> The article is not an exhaustive study, but it shows possibilities for further studies in this direction, outlining the most important and clearly expressed specific features of development of <b>banking</b> <b>systems</b> of states with different level of economic development in the pre-crisis period...|$|R

5|$|Juárez Celman's {{administration}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in the ratio of debt to GDP {{toward the end of his}} tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse of the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Glitnir would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> failed. On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, {{more than half a million}} depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.|$|E

The theoretical part also includes chapters about implementation approaches, the most common challenges in implementation and architecture of core <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> Next part of thesis is about the basic modules of core <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> The practical part is about the analysis of requirements on core <b>banking</b> <b>systems.</b> Especially the requirements that are mandatory from legislation perspective. These are SEPA payments, PSD 2 and instant payments. Gap analysis is used as the main method. We chose SEPA payment implemetation as the requirement that we will analyse. There are two possible solutions that can be used. The first one is the customization of the current payment module and the second solution is implementation of the payment hub. The conclusion of the thesis focuses on the best solution for each of two types of bank institutions. The main acquisition of the thesis is the recommended solution for two different types of banks.

5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E

While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed.

The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse.
