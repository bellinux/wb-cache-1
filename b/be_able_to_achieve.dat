Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E

25|$|A {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} study found that a single low dose of 10mg clomipramine to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50mg fluvoxamine. In the study, single doses of 5 to 50mg clomipramine resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while single doses of 12.5 to 50mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with clomipramine and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day citalopram. These results indicate that very low doses of clomipramine are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that clomipramine achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, clomipramine may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine.|$|E
25|$|On 8 July 2004 the Legislative Council {{passed the}} Education (Amendment) Bill.

500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{agreed with the}} decision to use helium. Szilard in particular was an early proponent of using liquid bismuth; but the major opponent was Wigner, who argued forcefully in favor of a water-cooled reactor design. He realized that since water absorbed neutrons, k would be reduced by about 3 percent, but had sufficient confidence in his calculations that the water-cooled reactor would still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> criticality. From an engineering perspective, a water-cooled design was straightforward to design and build, while helium posed technological problems. Wigner's team produced a preliminary report on water cooling, designated CE-140 in April 1942, followed by a more detailed one, CE-197, titled [...] "On a Plant with Water Cooling", in July 1942.|$|E

500|$|A single [...] {{diameter}} subwoofer {{driver was}} designed by Richard Clark and David Navone {{with the help of}} Dr. Eugene Patronis of the Georgia Institute of Technology.

500|$|French {{researchers}} Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported {{similar findings}} {{to that of}} O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D sonography of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating {{the ways in which}} erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina. On the basis of their findings, they argued that women may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot, because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 2009 published study, the [...] "coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall". Buisson and Foldès suggested [...] "that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction".|$|E
