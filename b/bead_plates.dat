Task Group 1 of the NeT collaborative network has examined this problem in an extensive programme of measurement and simulation extending from 2002 to 2008. As a result, the NeT <b>bead</b> on <b>plate</b> forms an ideal benchmark problem {{for the development of}} weld residual stress simulation techniques. One of the conclusions of NeT Task Group 1 is that the most accurate predictions of weld residual stresses in austenitic steels are achieved using mixed isotropic-kinematic material constitutive models. However, the use of these models can require both extensive materials data, and compromises in fitting either the monotonic or cyclic responses.

Predicted stresses and strains in the NeT <b>bead</b> on <b>plate</b> specimen are compared with the extensive database of residual stress measurements. Further studies examine sensitivity to the handling of high temperature inelastic strains, using a novel two-stage annealing functionality implemented within ABAQUS.

In the present work, the temperature distribution during <b>bead</b> on <b>plate</b> welding using MMA welding was experimentally determined for AISI type 304 stainless steel plates and low carbon steel plates of thickness 6 and 12 mm.

40|$|Diffusible {{hydrogen}} introduced {{during the}} welding process {{can drastically reduce}} the toughness and ductility of welds in steel structures. In welds experiencing high levels of longitudinal residual stress (such as upper passes in multipass thick sections), transverse weld metal cracking can occur. While there are methods available for assessing susceptibility of heat affected zones in the parent material to hydrogen cracking, there are few that are applicable to the deposited weld metal, and none that are quantitative in relation to transverse cracking. Therefore, the current work was undertaken to develop a test that isolates and quantitatively assesses the effects of diffusible hydrogen on transverse cracking in the weld metal. The test method was based on four point bending of as-deposited weld metal with controlled levels of diffusible hydrogen. It is proposed that such a test configuration allows quantitative assessment {{of the relationship between}} applied stress/strain, hydrogen content, microstructural characteristics and the fracture behaviour.

40|$|Keyhole welding, {{meaning that}} the laser beam forms a vapour cavity inside the steel, {{is one of the}} two types of laser welding {{processes}} and currently it is used in few industrial applications. Modern high power solid state lasers are becoming more used generally, but not all process fundamentals and phenomena of the process are well known and understanding of these helps to improve quality of final products. This study concentrates on the process fundamentals and the behaviour of the keyhole welding process by the means of real time high speed x-ray videography. One of the problem areas in laser welding has been mixing of the filler wire into the weld; the phenomena are explained and also one possible solution for this problem is presented in this study. The argument of this thesis is that the keyhole laser welding process has three keyhole modes that behave differently. These modes are trap, cylinder and kaleidoscope. Two of these have sub-modes, in which the keyhole behaves similarly but the molten pool changes behaviour and geometry of the resulting weld is different. X-ray videography was used to visualize the actual keyhole side view profile during the welding process. Several methods were applied to analyse and compile high speed x-ray video data to achieve a clearer image of the keyhole side view. Averaging was used to measure the keyhole side view outline, which was used to reconstruct a 3 D-model of the actual keyhole. This 3 D-model was taken as basis for calculation of the vapour volume inside of the keyhole for each laser parameter combination and joint geometry.
