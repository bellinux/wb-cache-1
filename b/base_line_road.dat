5|$|M-102 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey of the state, and the roadway is also called <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Road</b> in places. As a county road or city street, 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow Vernier Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at Vernier Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile Road name extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E
25|$|The entire landmass of Southern California was {{subdivided}} {{according to}} the San Bernardino Meridian, which was first plotted {{as part of the}} Public Land Survey System in November 1852, by Col. Henry Washington. <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> <b>road,</b> a major thoroughfare, today runs from Highland to San Dimas, intermittently along the absolute baseline coordinates plotted by Col. Washington. San Bernardino County was first formed out of parts of Los Angeles County on April 26, 1853. While the partition once included what is today most of Riverside County, the region is not as monolithic as it may sound. Rivalries between Colton, Redlands, Riverside and San Bernardino over the location of the county seat in the 1890s caused each of them to form their own civic communities, each with their own newspapers. On August 14, 1893, the state Senate allowed Riverside County to form out of land previously in San Bernardino and San Diego counties, after rejecting a bill for Pomona to split from L.A. County and become the seat of what would have been called San Antonio County.|$|E
500|$|... 8Mile Road is {{also known}} as <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Road,</b> for it was used to set the {{baseline}} for the Public Land Survey System in Michigan. The system helped bring order to county boundaries, which had often been set in other states by geographic markers such as rivers, hills, and trees, and were therefore rather irregular. Today, the baseline forms the northern or southern boundary of many southern Michigan counties.|$|E
50|$|Leaving Benmiller, {{the tornado}} {{entered into a}} more rural area once again, as it began to enter its final stages. Many tree limbs were removed by the tornado in {{addition}} to it toppling the trees themselves. The damage path also became more evident as it passed through open cornfields, downing large swaths of corn in an area about 200 metres wide. Crossing Sharpes Creek <b>Line</b> (Huron <b>Road</b> 31) there was more tree and corn damage by the tornado, though it was becoming increasingly weaker and sporadic in nature. The tornado eventually dissipated in the open fields between <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> (Huron <b>Road</b> 8) and London Road (Kings Highway 4), southwest of the village of Londesborough, after some 15 to 20 kilometres on the ground.|$|R
40|$|The author {{suggests}} a low cost special AB-Net from artificial fiber, which may protect cities and important objects from rockets, artillery and mortar shells, projectiles, bullets, and strategic weapons. The idea is as follows: The offered AB-Net joins an incoming projectile {{to a small}} braking parachute and this incoming projectile loses speed by air braking after a drag distance of 50 - 150 meters. A following interception net after the first may serve to collect the slowed projectiles and their fragments or bomblets {{so that they do}} not reach the aimpoint. The author offers the design of AB-Net, a developed theory of snagging with a small braking parachute by AB-Net; and sample computations. These nets may be used for defense of a town, city, military <b>base,</b> battle-front <b>line,</b> <b>road</b> (from terrorists), or any important objects or installations (for example nuclear electric station, government buildings, etc.). Computed projects are: Net to counter small rockets (for example, from Qassam), net to counter artillery projectile (caliber 76 mm), net to counter bullets (caliber 7. 6 mm). The offered method is cheaper by thousands of times than protection of a city by current anti-rocket systems. Discussion and results are {{at the end of the}} article. Key words: Protection from missile and projectile weapons, mortar, rocket, AB-Net, Qassam defense, incoming defense, armor. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
