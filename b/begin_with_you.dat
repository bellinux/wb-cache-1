40|$|The U. S. Department of Labor s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA),through its winter alert program, warns U.

MSHA records indicate that, historically, most explosions in underground coal mines occur during winter months. The changes in weather can {{increase the risk of}} fatal accidents, says David G. Dye, Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health. Each miner and mine operator must take individual responsibility to eliminate the kinds of hazards that can cause fatal accidents in the workplace. Safety is not the other guy s job safety <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> In fact, MSHA s slogan for this year s campaign is Winter Alert Starts Now and Safety <b>Begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>YOU.</b> This message reminds miners and mine operators of the risks of colder weather and educates them about helping to reduce risks and hazards. Safety requires the joint effort of both management and labor, Dye says. Everyone at the mine site must see safety as an individual value and act to ensure a safe working environment...|$|R
