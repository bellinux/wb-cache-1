Furthermore microbiological examinations were undertaken to characterize the activated sludges which produce N_ 2 O. The examinations showed that the total of N_ 2 O-N emissions from wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> (in respect to 1991) in the Federal Republic of Germany ranges from 2300 to 3400 t/a. 1500 to 2600 t/a come from domesticf, <b>biological</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> 770 t/a from industrial <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> which discharge directly into receiving waters. The NO-N emission is assessed {{to be less than}} 0, 1 %. The reasons which lead to a release of N_ 2 O are high concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, shock loads of substances with a high COD, deficiency of organic substrates, semi-aerobic conditions (< 0, 5 mg/l O_ 2), pH-values under 6. A correlation between the emission of N_ 2 O and a special waste water engineering process does not exist. In general all sludges can release N_ 2 O under denitrifying conditions. (orig.)

In March 1997, a new <b>biological</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> came on-line and the effluent was discharged via a longer outfall pipe into the Bay south of Heysham. The effect of the new sewage treatment {{on the quality of}} the bathing waters was monitored by testing sea water collected from the three EU designated bathing waters on Morecambe Bay: Morecambe North, Morecambe South and Heysham. After sewage treatment came on-line, the numbers of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were lower at Morecambe North and Morecambe South but higher at Heysham. Although the changes in numbers were not always statistically significant, they were sufficient to affect compliance with the EU Bathing Water Directive Imperative (mandatory) standards. Compliance improved markedly at Morecambe North and South but declined at Heysham, the closest bathing site to the new outfall. Numbers of thermophilic campylobacters were similar in both years, which is suggestive of their sources being different from those of the indicator bacteria.

On the basis of hydrochemical analyses it was stated that the discharge of treated sewage led to worsening of 18 out of 20 studied water quality indices in the Bobrza River. In the river water below the sewage discharge statistically significantly higher values of electrolytic conductivity, dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium were registered. A decrease in dissolved oxygen content in the water and increase in its electrolytic conductivity caused a change of water quality class in the Bobrza River from the maximum potential to potential below good. On the other hand, increase in concentrations of dissolved solids and sulphates caused a change of the water class from the maximum potential to good potential. Statistical factor analysis (FA) made possible a reduction of a set of 20 physicochemical elements to four mutually orthogonal factors explaining 95 % (above the treatment plant) and 96 % (below the treatment plant) of the internal structure of primary data. The first factor is connected with point source pollution (sewage discharge), the second describes oxygen conditions in water, the third results from seasonality and is responsible for the pollutants from natural sources, whereas the fourth factor has not been unanimously defined yet...|$|E

40|$|The Beaudesert <b>Sewage</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> (STP), {{originally}} {{built in}} 1966 and augmented in 1977, {{is a typical}} <b>biological</b> trickling filter <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> comprising primary sedimentation tanks, trickling filters and humus tanks. The plant, despite not originally being designed for nitrogen removal, has been consistently achieving over 60 % total nitrogen (TN) reduction and low effluent ammonium concentration of less than 5 mg NH 3 -N/L. Through the return of a nitrate-rich stream from the humus tanks to the primary sedimentation tanks and maintaining an adequate sludge age within the primary sedimentation tanks, the current plant is achieving a substantial degree of denitrification. Further enhanced denitrification has been achieved by raising the recycle flows and maintaining an adequate SRT. This paper describes the approach to operating a trickling filter plant to achieve nitrification and denitrification to a high level. The effectiveness {{of this approach is}} demonstrated through pilot plant trials and analysis of their corresponding results. These results show a significant improvement in nitrogen removal capability whilst maximising the asset life of existing infrastructure. This shows great potential as a retrofit option for small and rural communities with pre-existing trickling filters that require improvements in terms of nitrogen removal.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{that are}} {{intended}} for human use are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. This is predominantly from the excretion of pharmaceuticals by patients, in their urine and faeces, which subsequently enter <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>Sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> provides a final opportunity for pharmaceutical removal, prior to discharge into the environment, however, removal is often incomplete. Once in the environment, pharmaceuticals {{have the potential to}} cause effects on aquatic organisms. <b>Sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> that are designed to meet statutory discharge consents for nutrients, are increasing in number. These plants, capable of biological nutrient removal, are understudied for the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals. This thesis presents research findings on the behaviour, fate and removal of selected pharmaceuticals in a bespoke laboratory rig, and in operational <b>biological</b> nutrient removal <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> Pharmaceuticals possessing a broad range of physical and chemical properties were selected for this research, they included: salicylic acid, caffeine, propranolol, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Sensitive chromatographic methods were developed to quantify the analytes in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor rig and in operational plants. Radiolabelled 14 C isotopes of salicylic acid, caffeine, propranolol and diclofenac were dosed into the laboratory rig. The compounds exhibited different behaviours during a simulated <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> process. Salicylic acid and caffeine produced the highest amount of biodegradation, with 25. 2 % and 14. 5 % of the radiolabel mineralised to 14 CO 2 in the rig. However, parent degradation is likely to have been higher, since neither compound could be detected in the effluent by specific chemical analysis. These findings were replicated in the operational <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> with > 97 % removal of both pharmaceuticals, in all three plants investigated. Propranolol and diclofenac were less affected by biodegradation processes, and produced 3. 7 % and 0. 2 % mineralisation, respectively, in the laboratory rig. Furthermore, 33. 8 % of the radioactivity associated to 14 C propranolol was detected in the rig solids. These compounds showed insignificant removal from two operational plants; 6. 8 % and 20. 9 % (propranolol) and - 0. 9 % and - 39. 4 % (diclofenac). Monitoring of operational plants showed that concentrations of propranolol were highest in the activated sludge tanks at all three sites. This supports the findings from the rig, that propranolol interacts with the sludge, which might be more significant in plants with lower sludge wastage rates, such as sequencing batch reactors. This could have implications for the terrestrial environment, and therefore, terrestrial risk assessments should be refined accordingly. Monitoring of the operational <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> highlighted the widespread presence, and recalcitrant behaviour, of carbamazepine during <b>biological</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment.</b> Future work should focus on investigating the mechanisms of removal, of this pharmaceutical in the laboratory sequencing batch reactor. This work highlighted the problems biological systems face in effectively removing recalcitrant pharmaceuticals. Advanced wastewater treatment should be considered, if complete removal is desired.
