2500|$|To {{build the}} high banking, crews had to {{excavate}} {{over a million}} square yards of soil from the track's infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what {{is now known as}} Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph [...] "Sax" [...] Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange speedboat races on it.) 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track's <b>binding</b> <b>base,</b> over which asphalt would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny {{had to come up with}} a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) and eukaryotic thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) enzymes form a homologous {{family of}} DNA glycosylases that initiate base-excision repair of G:U/T mismatches. Despite low sequence homology, the MUG/TDG enzymes are structurally {{related to the}} uracil-DNA glycosylase enzymes, but {{have a very different}} mechanism for substrate recognition. We have now determined the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli MUG enzyme complexed with an oligonucleotide containing a non-hydrolysable deoxyuridine analogue mismatched with guanine, providing the first structure of an intact substrate-nucleotide productively bound to a hydrolytic DNA glycosylase. The structure of this complex explains the preference for G:U over G:T mispairs, and reveals an essentially non-specific pyrimidine-binding pocket that allows MUG/TDG enzymes to excise the alkylated base, 3, N(4) -ethenocytosine. Together with structures for the free enzyme and for an abasic-DNA product complex, the MUG-substrate analogue complex reveals the conformational changes accompanying the catalytic cycle of substrate <b>binding,</b> <b>base</b> excision and product release...|$|E
40|$|The RepA protein from {{bacteriophage}} P 1 binds DNA {{to initiate}} replication. RepA covers one {{face of the}} DNA and the binding site has a completely conserved T that directly faces RepA from the minor groove at position + 7. Although all four bases can be distinguished through contacts in the major groove of B-form DNA, contacts in the minor groove cannot easily distinguish between A and T bases. Therefore the 100 % conservation at this position cannot {{be accounted for by}} direct contacts approaching into the minor groove of B-form DNA. RepA binding sites with modified base pairs at position + 7 were used to investigate contacts with RepA. The data show that RepA contacts the N 3 proton of T at position + 7 and that the T=A hydrogen bonds are already broken in the DNA before RepA binds. To accommodate the N 3 proton contact the T+ 7  /A+ 7 ′ base pair must be distorted. One possibility is that T+ 7 is flipped out of the helix. The energetics of the contact allows RepA to distinguish between all four bases, accounting for the observed high sequence conservation. After protein <b>binding,</b> <b>base</b> pair distortion or base flipping could initiate DNA melting as the second step in DNA replication...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{is involved}} in epigenetic control of numer-ous cellular processes in eukaryotes, however, many mech-anistic aspects of this phenomenon are not yet understood. A bacterial prototype cytosine-C 5 methyltransferase, M. HhaI, serves as a paradigm system for structural and mechanistic studies of biological DNA methylation, but further analysis of the 37 kDa protein is hampered by its insufficient solubility (0. 15 mM). To overcome this problem, three hydrophobic patches {{on the surface of}} M. HhaI that are not involved in substrate interactions were subjected to site-specific mutagenesis. Residues M 51 or V 213 were substituted by polar amino acids of a similar size, and/or the C-terminal tetrapeptide FKPY was replaced by a single glycine residue (∆ 324 G). Two out of six mutants, ∆ 324 G and V 213 S/∆ 324 G, showed improved solubility in initial analyses and were purified to homogeneity using a newly developed procedure. Biochemical studies of the engineered methyltransferases showed that the deletion mutant ∆ 324 G retained identical DNA <b>binding,</b> <b>base</b> flipping and catalytic properties as the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the engine-ered enzyme showed (i) a significantly increased solubility (> 0. 35 mM), (ii) high-quality 2 D-[15 N, 1 H] TROSY NMR spectra, and (iii) 15 N spin relaxation times evidencing the presence of a monomeric well-folded protein in solution...|$|E
40|$|Ketolides are {{the latest}} {{derivatives}} developed from the macrolide erythromycin to improve antimicrobial activity. All macrolides and ketolides bind to the 50 S ribosomal subunit, where they {{come into contact with}} adenosine 2058 (A 2058) within domain V of the 23 S rRNA and block protein synthesis. An additional interaction at nucleotide A 752 in the rRNA domain II is made via the synthetic carbamate-alkyl-aryl substituent in the ketolides HMR 3647 (telithromycin) and HMR 3004, and this interaction contributes to their improved activities. Only a few macrolides, including tylosin, come into contact with domain II of the rRNA and do so via interactions with nucleotides G 748 and A 752. We have disrupted these macrolide-ketolide interaction sites in the rRNA to assess their relative importance for <b>binding.</b> <b>Base</b> substitutions at A 752 were shown to confer low levels of resistance to telithromycin but not to HMR 3004, while deletion of A 752 confers low levels of resistance to both ketolides. Mutations at position 748 confer no resistance. Substitution of guanine at A 2058 gives rise to the MLSB (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B) phenotype, which confers resistance to all the drugs. However, resistance to ketolides was abolished when the mutation at position 2058 was combined with a mutation in domain II of the same rRNA. In contrast, the same dual mutations in rRNAs conferred enhanced resistance to tylosin. Our results show that the domain II interactions of telithromycin and HMR 3004 differ from each other and from those of tylosin. The data provide no indication that mutations within domain II, either alone or in combination with an A 2058 mutation, can confer significant levels of telithromycin resistance...|$|E

Searching for the best concept the Nadler's method was finally chosen. Work on the above system was complemented by preparation of the land-recording subsystem "EKGRUN" designed by the same centre. This subsystem represents a separate element in the goodesic-cartographic information system "GEOKART" being designed now. It is an attempt at computerization of work on establishing and running a land cadastre making provisions for previously <b>binding</b> <b>base</b> contents and enriohod by a number of additional elements enhancing its utility values. This subsystem will be mainly used by local administration organs of all levels. The subsystem calls for application of the computer equipment of the ODRA 1300 series with tape recordings btit, taking into account the fact of systematic installation of RIAD equipment in computer centros work was started on redesigning the system to use RIÁD- 32 computer in its disk version. Another subsystem being designed at present in the ZETO-Lublin encompasses "Soil Environment". It is worth noting here that the computer centre in Lublin observes the principle that all subsystems about "land-region" designed in the ZETO-Lublin must be coherent, that is they should allow for reciprooal transfer of information being indispensable for effective management. Search for methods and designing solutions regional systems or those co-operating within a given region will be continued until there are elaborated and become binding certain norms, prinoiples of cohesion, and until there is performed a proper division of subject scope for particular subsystems excluding a chance of repetition in collection of the same data.
