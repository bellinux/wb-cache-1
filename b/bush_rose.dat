The air that flowed about the boy was sweet and scented with the fragrance of pine and cedar. All around him the <b>bush</b> <b>rose</b> in somber masses and a faint elfin sighing fell from the tops of the tall black trees.

5000|$|In 1961 she {{reactivated}} {{the rose}} breeding program in Ottawa {{aimed to develop}} completely winter-hardy, recurrent-flowering varieties. [...] She also sought varieties resistant to black spot and mildew, and ones with good ornamental features of flower and shrub. The rose varieties available in Canada in 1961 could not survive without winter protection outside the warmer conditions of southern Ontario (Niagara Peninsula) and the coast of British Columbia. Armed with patience and determination, Dr. Svejda managed to succeed in developing a first variety with these characteristics after 8 years. In 1968 she launched the first national trial of ornamental shrubs in Canada whereby she sent her roses and other plants to locations across North America to test their survival rates in local climates. The Explorer rose series includes 25 different varieties released between 1968 and 1999; 13 developed during her career, the remainder developed by the program after her retirement. The Explorer Roses are winter hardy, recurrent-flowering, disease-resistant plants that have {{made their way into}} park gardens and backyards all over Canada. Some of the hardier cultivars are also grown in Finland, Russia, Iceland, Germany and her homeland of Austria, and have been adapted by others for harsh climates such as the Nevada desert.The Explorer Roses include: Alexander Mackenzie, Captain Samuel Holland, Champlain (a <b>bush</b> <b>rose</b> that flowers throughout the summer and fall), Charles Albanel, David Thompson, De Montarville, Frontenac, George Vancouver, Henry Hudson, Henry Kelsey, J.P.

40|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>rose</b> architecture, {{among other}} factors, such as plant health, determines plant visual quality. The {{commercial}} product {{is the individual}} plant and interplant variability may be high within a crop. Thus, both mean plant architecture and interplant variability should be studied. Expansion is an important feature of architecture, {{but it has been}} little studied at the level of individual organs in bush roses. We investigated the expansion kinetics of primary shoot organs, to develop a model reproducing the organ expansion of real crops from non destructive input variables. We took interplant variability in expansion kinetics and the model’s ability to simulate this variability into account. Changes in leaflet and internode dimensions over thermal time were recorded for primary shoot expansion, on 83 plants from three crops grown in different climatic conditions and densities. An empirical model was developed, to reproduce organ expansion kinetics for individual plants of a real crop of <b>bush</b> <b>rose</b> primary shoots. Leaflet or internode length was simulated as a logistic function of thermal time. The model was evaluated by cross-validation. We found that differences in leaflet or internode expansion kinetics between phytomer positions and between plants at a given phytomer position were due mostly to large differences in time of organ expansion and expansion rate, rather than differences in expansion duration. Thus, in the model, the parameters linked to expansion duration were predicted by values common to all plants, whereas variability in final size and organ expansion time was captured by input data. The model accurately simulated leaflet and internode expansion for individual plants (RMSEP = 7. 3 % and 10. 2 % of final length, respectively). Thus, this study defines the measurements required to simulate expansion and provides the first model simulating organ expansion in rosebush to capture interplant variability...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{shape is}} a major {{component}} of the visual quality of ornamental plants. It is the result of their architectural construction. It can be analyzed by breaking down the plant into entities (axis, metamer) that can be characterized morphologically, topologically and geometrically. Eight <b>bush</b> <b>rose</b> cultivars were selected for their contrasting shapes (from upright to spreading) and their architecture was digitized at two scales, the plant and the axis, differentiating between short and long axes. Thirty-five variables were measured. Measurement acquisition is nevertheless tedious and time-consuming and not really compatible with an analysis involving a large number of individuals. To diminish these constraints, our approach aimed at reducing the number of variables measured, limiting ourselves to the ones most relevant for describing the architecture. A selection of variables was made using the following criteria: to represent the different categories of variables describing the plant architecture; to explain the variability observed; to present the weakest correlation between them. Seven variables were selected: at the plant scale, the number of determined axes, the number of long axes of order 3 and the branching order number; at the long axis scale, the number of metamers and the length of the axis; and at the short axis scale, the basal diameter of the axis and the branching angle of the cord in relation to the vertical axis. Four architectural profiles were differentiated based on these seven variables. Moreover, a high correlation was revealed between some of these architectural variables and a shape descriptor...|$|E

40|$|Rosebush {{architecture}} {{resulting from}} the spatial organisation of the plant axes induces plant shape and consequently within ornamental horticulture context, its visual quality and commercial value. This architecture can be modulated by environmental conditions, particularly in the horticulture {{context in which the}} possibilities to control growing conditions are numerous. The objectives of the study were to determine, ill young rose bushes, (1) whether short periods of nitrogen deficiency affect branching and (2) whether this effect is sufficient to modify the visual quality of the plant in a sustainable manner. Between vegetative bud burst and the petal colour visible stage of the generated primary branch, young rooted cuttings of <b>bush</b> <b>rose</b> (cv Radrazz) were subjected to one of three nitrogen regimes: (1) no nitrogen deficiency, (2) continuous nitrogen deficiency, i. e. 35 days of N deficiency, and (3) nitrogen deficiency restricted to the flowering stages, i. e. 18 days of N deficiency. After the petal colour visible stage, all three groups of plants were supplied continuously with nitrogen. We observed the morphology of the axes and the kinetics of axillary bud burst. Twelve weeks after the petal colour visible stage, the visual quality of the rose bushes was evaluated by an expert jury. We found that nitrogen deficiencies (1) increased bud burst ratios in the medial and basal zones of the primary branch, (2) delayed the bud burst in the apical zone of the primary branch and (3) had long-term effects on plant visual quality. The continuous nitrogen deficiency regime produced flatter, more asymmetric and less vigorous rose bushes than the no nitrogen deficiency regime. By contrast, nitrogen deficiency during the flowering stages only resulted in more symmetric, taller and more vigorous rose bushes than the no nitrogen deficiency regime. Based on these results, the role of nitrogen on bud burst was discussed and candidate processes at the origin of the visual quality modification were suggested. This new approach combining ecophysiology and sensory assessment of ornamental plants enabled the identification of some early architecture components to be correlated with later visual quality characteristics and then to better target the physiological processes of interest.

40|$|Apparent competition, {{mediated}} by a shared predator, {{plays a key}} role in conservation biological control. Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of <b>rose</b> <b>bush</b> [Rosa rugosa (Thunb.) ] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the <b>rose</b> <b>bushes</b> may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of <b>rose</b> <b>bushes</b> of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on <b>rose</b> <b>bushes</b> and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of <b>rose</b> <b>bushes</b> did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the <b>rose</b> <b>bushes</b> to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in <b>rose</b> <b>bushes</b> and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004...|$|R
