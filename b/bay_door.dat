2500|$|General Dynamics {{was chosen}} to make {{modifications}} to the B-57E as it had extensive experience in modifying Canberras with the RB-57D and RB-57F projects and turning the B-57 into a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft equipped with various electronic and imagery equipment. [...] The forward nose section of the B-57Es were modified to house a KA-1 36-inch forward oblique camera and a low panoramic KA-56 camera used on the Lockheed U-2. Mounted inside the specially-configured bomb <b>bay</b> <b>door</b> was a KA-1 vertical camera, a K-477 split vertical day-night camera, an infrared scanner, and a KA-1 left oblique camera. The modified aircraft were redesignated RB-57E.|$|E
2500|$|The Buccaneer {{had been}} {{designed}} specifically as a maritime nuclear strike aircraft. [...] Its intended weapon was a nuclear air-to-surface missile: codenamed Green Cheese, but this weapon's development was cancelled, and in its place was the unguided [...] Red Beard, which had been developed for the English Electric Canberra. [...] Red Beard had an explosive yield in the 10 to 20 kiloton range; and was mounted on a special bomb <b>bay</b> <b>door,</b> into which it nested neatly to reduce aerodynamic buffet on the launch aircraft. [...] At low levels and high speeds, traditional bomb bay doors could not be opened safely into the air stream; therefore, doors were developed that rotated into the fuselage to expose the payload; this feature also proved convenient in providing ground-level access.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{modified}} RB-57As {{were used by}} the 7499th Support Group at Wiesbaden AB, West Germany in Operation [...] "Heart Throb" [...] reconnaissance missions over Europe. [...] Ten aircraft were pulled off Martin's production line and modifications were performed in August 1955 by the Wright Air Development Center and by Martin. [...] All equipment not absolutely essential for the daytime photography role was eliminated. The bomb <b>bay</b> <b>door</b> was removed and the area was skinned over. The seat for the system operator/navigator was removed, and an optical viewfinder was installed in the nose so that the pilot could perform all the reconnaissance duties without {{the assistance of the}} navigator. The clear plexiglass nose cone was replaced by an opaque fiberglass cone, but with a small optical glass window cut for the viewfinder. The plane's J65-BW-5s were replaced by higher-thrust J65-W-7s. The aircraft was referred to as RB-57A-1. The weight reduction program shaved 5665 pounds off the weight of the RB-57A, and the ceiling was increased by 5000 feet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{prototype}} orbiter Enterprise {{originally had}} a {{flag of the}} United States on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters [...] "USA" [...] in black on the right wing. The name [...] "Enterprise" [...] in black was painted on the payload <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> just above the forwardmost hinge and behind the crew module; on the aft end of the payload <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> was the NASA [...] "worm" [...] logotype in gray.

2500|$|The name iPod was {{proposed}} by Vinnie Chieco, a freelance copywriter, who (with others) {{was called by}} Apple {{to figure out how}} to introduce the new player to the public. After Chieco saw a prototype, he thought of the movie [...] and the phrase [...] "Open the pod <b>bay</b> <b>door,</b> Hal!", which refers to the white EVA Pods of the Discovery One spaceship. Chieco saw an analogy to the relationship between the spaceship and the smaller independent pods in the relationship between a personal computer and the music player. Apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use. Joseph N. Grasso of New Jersey had originally listed an [...] "iPod" [...] trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in July 2000 for Internet kiosks. The first iPod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in New Jersey in March 1998, and commercial use began in January 2000, but had apparently been discontinued by 2001. The trademark was registered by the USPTO in November 2003, and Grasso assigned it to Apple Computer, Inc. in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Lone Survivor (2013), Luttrell was portrayed by actor Mark Wahlberg. Luttrell makes a {{significant}} cameo appearance (uncredited) {{in at least}} three scenes in the film and is present in other scenes, as well. He first appears as one of the SEALs, referred to as [...] "Frankie" [...] by Lt. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), lightheartedly hazing rookie SEAL Shane Patton (Alexander Ludwig) before the mission, jokingly giving Shane his first mission or [...] "op" [...] of cleaning the table, supplemented by knocking over a drink. His second appearance is during the presentation of the rules of engagement for Operation Red Wings where he can be seen shaking his head at the rules governing return fire. [...] This scene is significant. [...] In his book, Lone Survivor, Marcus explains extensively how these rules created substantial risk for the forces in Afghanistan. His third appearance is later in the film as one of the 16 special operators aboard the doomed Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Luttrell and his team. The camera stops on him and several real-life SEALs just before the Taliban's rocket-propelled grenade comes through the open rear <b>bay</b> <b>door</b> and impacts the Chinook's interior, killing everyone aboard. [...] "I {{was on the other side}} of the mountain when those guys came to help me," [...] Luttrell says of his real-life experience, [...] "so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me." ...|$|E

50|$|Inside, {{there were}} two levels. The upper level held seats for 32. The lower level was used for freight or to carry bombs when used in the bombing role, with two large {{duralumin}} bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors.</b> The floor was made of wood, with nine detachable panels, that helped with the accommodation (through the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors)</b> of heavy loads. The cockpit held four: two pilots, with the first (on the left) with an armoured seat, a mechanic and an engineer/gunner.|$|R

5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were {{able to get out of}} the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued.|$|R

5000|$|Modified {{with new}} glazed nose section, new {{radiators}} and new [...] "D" [...] fin and rudder. The dorsal turret {{was changed to}} a four-gun Boulton Paul Type A Mk VIII, and there were improvements to the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>door</b> sealing. Some aircraft were fitted with the H2S radar.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower deck}} set {{incorporated}} {{the front of}} the ship, including the cargo <b>bay</b> <b>door</b> and surrounding hull, the forward landing gear, and the engine nacelles, as well as a small amount of soundstage area where scenery could be placed in front of the ship. Digital effects were used to add the rest of the ship in during post-production. The lower deck was built on Stage 16, which was modified during the filming of Alien Resurrection to include a 36 by 45 m water tank under the floor for underwater scenes. The tank was located under Serenity’s cargo <b>bay</b> <b>door,</b> which Whedon planned to use in a later episode: several characters would run through the cargo bay and jump off the ramp into the tank, which would be dressed as a lake or lagoon.|$|E
50|$|French {{manufacturer}} Messier produced, to the Yugoslavian specification, {{the complete}} hydraulics equipment and landing gear. The system powered the landing gear, cooling gills, bomb <b>bay</b> <b>door,</b> and gunner sliding hood, tail wheel and flaps. Landing gear retracted into the nacelles behind the engines. The wheels were fitted with low pressure tires which {{allowed it to}} operate off grass airstrips.|$|E
5000|$|Some weapons [...] {{require that}} the weapon's {{guidance}} system acquire the target while the weapon is still attached to the aircraft. This forces relatively extended operations with the <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> open.|$|R
50|$|Stealth {{aircraft}} are still vulnerable to detection during, {{and immediately after}} using their weaponry. Since stealth payload (reduced RCS bombs and cruise missiles) are not yet generally available, and ordnance mount points create a significant radar return, stealth aircraft carry all armaments internally. As soon as weapons <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> are opened, the plane's RCS will be multiplied and even older generation radar systems {{will be able to}} locate the stealth aircraft. While the aircraft will reacquire its stealth as soon as the <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> are closed, a fast response defensive weapons system has a short opportunity to engage the aircraft.|$|R
