40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine information sources/media used by small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> and their relationships to the planning process, entrepreneurial intensity and firm performance.

40|$|The {{principle}} problem {{under investigation}} was: What {{is the relationship}} between the educational needs of small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> and the educational opportunities provided by marketing education? A competency identification approach was used to answer this question. ^ The literature indicated that small business management competencies could be separated into four categories. Seventy-two financial planning, 57 accounting procedure, 100 management, and 116 marketing competencies were identified. The importance of these competencies to successful small business management was assessed by 38 members of the Service Corps of Retired Executives. Competencies ranked in the fourth quartile (n = 85) were used in subsequent questionnaires. ^ A sample of 200 small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas was selected. This group indicated their need for education in the 85 competencies previously identified. A mailed questionnaire was used. ^ One hundred secondary and postsecondary marketing education instructors in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas were also selected. If they had responsibility for adult programs, they rated the importance of the 85 competencies in the programs they provide to small <b>business</b> <b>managers.</b> Those without adult program responsibility assessed their capabilities to teach the competencies. Mailed questionnaires were used. ^ Data from small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> were compared with data from marketing education instructors with adult program responsibilities. Data from both groups of instructors were also compared. ^ The major conclusions of the study were: (1) The importance of the competencies in programs provided to adults is different from the self-assessed capabilities to teach the competencies. (2) The educational needs of small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> in marketing and accounting procedures are related to the experiences provided by marketing education. (3) Service Corps of Retired Executives representatives, small <b>business</b> <b>managers,</b> and instructors with adult responsibility rated the competencies in a similar manner. (4) Small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> rated the competencies higher than marketing education instructors. (5) Marketing education philosophy concerning adult education is not practiced in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. (6) Instructors without adult program responsibility do not perceive themselves capable of teaching the competencies identified in this study. (7) The pre-service education of marketing education instructors is similar to the educational needs of small <b>business</b> <b>managers.</b> (8) Small <b>business</b> <b>managers</b> have educational needs that can be met by marketing education. ...|$|R
