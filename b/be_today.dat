5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might <b>be</b> <b>today,</b> as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign {{ingredients}} and influence from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, {{and in the case of}} a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would <b>be</b> <b>today.</b> She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E

25|$|The items used in {{decoration}} {{may also}} have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might <b>be</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{recommendations}} of Guyton covered only what would <b>be</b> <b>today</b> known as inorganic compounds. With the massive expansion of organic chemistry {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century and the greater understanding of the structure of organic compounds, the need for a less ad hoc system of nomenclature was felt just as the theoretical tools became available to make this possible. An international conference was convened in Geneva in 1892 by the national chemical societies, from which the first widely accepted proposals for standardization arose.|$|E
25|$|Riquet {{studied in}} depth {{the supply of}} water to the canal at the seuil de Naurouze. His study {{appeared}} rigorous and included a pilot phase {{with the construction of}} the Rigole de la plaine to substantiate his claim. The project still remained unclear in many respects especially the route of the canal. This route was not final and was not precise as it would <b>be</b> <b>today</b> for a highway project or high-speed railway. Only the directions of the route were known and plotted on a map. Changes in the route could be made by the Contractor depending on the difficulties he encountered on the ground.|$|E

25|$|In the 2nd century, Macedonia covered {{approximately}} {{the area where}} it is considered to <b>be</b> <b>today,</b> but the northern regions of today Republic of Macedonia were not identified as Macedonian lands. For reasons that are still unclear, over the next eleven centuries Macedonia's location was changed significantly. The Roman province of Macedonia consisted of what is today Northern and Central Greece, much of the geographical area of the present-day Republic of Macedonia and southeast Albania. Simply put, the Romans created a much larger administrative area under that name than the original ancient Macedon. In late Roman times, the provincial boundaries were reorganized to form the Diocese of Macedonia, consisting of most of modern mainland Greece right across the Aegean to include Crete, southern Albania, parts of south-west Bulgaria and southern Republic of Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|Freed of London was {{established}} in 1929 by cobbler Frederick Freed, his wife and an assistant. Freed {{and his wife had}} both been previously employed by Gamba, a London-based dance shoe maker. After several years of work at Gamba, they decided to open workshop {{in the basement of a}} shop in Covent Garden. In 1934, production became too large for the store basement in Covent Garden, and manufacturing was moved to a small factory in Endell street. In 1947, manufacturing was once again moved due to the increasing scale of production. Freed of London transitioned its headquarters to a larger factory on Mercer Street. It was during this time that Freed started to become the prestigious and well-known company that it continues to <b>be</b> <b>today.</b> Frederick Freed retired in 1968 and the company was acquired by D H Sam Thomson Limited and Magdalan Shoes of Norwich. The three companies joined together and continued to operate as Freed of London. It wasn't until 1985 that Freed began manufacturing dance apparel. In 1993, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese apparel company Onward Kashiyama. The Freed corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities were retained after the acquisition and continue to operate at their original location in London.|$|E

500|$|The Oxford English Dictionary {{defines the}} word cunt as [...] "The female {{external}} genital organs" [...] and notes [...] "Its currency is restricted {{in the manner}} of other taboo-words: see the small-type note s.v. FUCK v." [...] During the Middle Ages the word may often have been considered merely vulgar, having been in common use in its anatomical sense since at least the 13thcentury. [...] In The Miller's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer writes [...] "And prively he caughte hire by the queynte" [...] (and intimately he caught her by her crotch), and Philotus (1603) mentions [...] "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt." [...] Gradually though the word became used more as the obscenity it is generally considered to <b>be</b> <b>today.</b> [...] In John Garfield's Wandring Whore II (1660) the word is applied to a woman, specifically a whore—"this is none of your pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a sturdy C— but eighteen pence or two shillings, and repent of the business afterwards". [...] Francis Grose's A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue (1785) lists the word as [...] "C**t. [...] The chonnos of the Greek, and the cunnus of the Latin dictionaries; a nasty name for a nasty thing: un con Miege." ...|$|E

We’re all right on the limit and as we’ve seen here that’s causing quite a high rate of attrition. Third time lucky at Le Mans is the plan." [...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle. The {{chief executive officer of the}} World Endurance Championship Gerard Neveu {{described the}} event as [...] "a great day for motorsport" [...] but felt that it was slightly strange. He revealed that after the race, he had organised a meeting with several people and raised the question of why [...] "there was so much aggression and action in Spa. It's quite simple: the cars are all so close together, the competition is so hard as never before. It can happen at any time - that is exciting...".|$|E

500|$|Kepler {{had found}} that the {{distance}} between the planets increased in proportion to their distance from the Sun, and this led him to assume that the universe was created with a divine harmony, and that the size of the planets would increase in the same way. He had written in 1618, [...] "Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitude should be the same as the order of the spheres". When Horrocks's measurements of Venus, coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi, seemed to confirm this, Horrocks tentatively proposed a law which stated that all planets (with the exception of Mars) would be the same angular size when viewed from the Sun, this being 28 arc seconds. This meant that the assumption Kepler had made about the sizes of the planets held true, and led Horrocks to the false conclusion that the distance between each planet and the Sun was about 15,000 times its radius. Thus he estimated the average distance from the Earth to the Sun to be approximately 60 million miles (97 million km), suggesting that the Solar System was ten times larger than traditionally believed. His figure was much lower than the 93million miles (150million km) that the Astronomical Unit is known to <b>be</b> <b>today,</b> but, despite being based on a false premise, was more accurate than any suggested up to that time.|$|E

Walsh described Gately as his [...] "very, very best friend" [...] after the singer's death, saying: [...] "Of all the people I've worked with I don't think anybody thanked me as much as Stephen.

There have been angry statements by those adhering to the older pro-British position.
