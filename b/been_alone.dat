5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E

25|$|The Norse may {{not have}} <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> on the island when they arrived; a new influx of Arctic people from the west, the Late Dorset culture, may predate them. However, this culture {{was limited to the}} extreme {{northwest}} of Greenland, far from the Norse who lived around the southern coasts. Some archaeological evidence may point to this culture slightly predating the Norse settlement. It disappeared around 1300, around {{the same time as the}} westernmost of the Norse settlements disappeared. In the region of this culture, there is archaeological evidence of gathering sites for around four to thirty families, living together for a short time during their movement cycle.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of her murder, Christine and Fred Schultz had been {{divorced}} six months. Fred Schultz initially stated he was on duty investigating a burglary with his partner, Michael Durfee, at {{the time of}} the murder, but years later he admitted they were actually drinking at a local bar. When ballistics testing revealed it was his off-duty revolver that had been the murder weapon, suspicion shifted to Laurie Bembenek, as she had <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> in the apartment she shared with Schultz and had access to both the gun and a key to Christine's house that Fred Schultz had secretly copied from his oldest son's house key. Bembenek was arrested for Christine Schultz's murder on June 24, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said {{that while he was}} not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white {{teenagers}} from his vantage point between a box car and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro.

25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} {{opportunity}} to try to reach terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point. He had evidently prepared to overlook them by the time he made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have <b>been</b> <b>alone.</b> The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E

When Villa was four, his chances of becoming a footballer were put in jeopardy when he suffered a fracture to the femur in his right leg, but he made a complete recovery. Due to the injury, {{he and his father}} worked on strengthening his left leg and Villa ultimately became ambidextrous. He recalls his father being consistently supportive: [...] "He would be there throwing me the ball over and over, making me kick it with my left leg when my right was in plaster after breaking it, I was four.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song refer to a spirit that haunts {{the memory of a}} grieving loved one. Similar to several other songs written by Moody, the lyrics {{of the song}} are based on a short story he had {{previously}} written. According to Lee, it was [...] "Ben 's song." [...] Moody said that the song talks about [...] "a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone." [...] He also stated in the booklet of Fallen that he dedicated the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. In [...] "My Immortal", Lee expresses her feelings through the line, [...] "Though you're still with me / I've <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> all along."

On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Tracy awakened at 3:00am to make himself a cup of tea in his apartment in Beverly Hills, California. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: [...] "Just as I was about to give [...] a push, there was a sound of a cup smashing to the floor—then clump—a loud clump." [...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, [...] "He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him." [...] MGM publicist Howard Strickling told the media that Tracy had <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> when he died and was found by his housekeeper.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the first}} three days at Twickenham, Harrison had {{presented}} new compositions such as [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Let It Down" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] for consideration; these and other [...] "numerous beautiful songs", music journalist Martin O'Gorman writes, [...] "received derision and disinterest from Lennon or heavy-handed interference from McCartney". On 8 January, Harrison debuted [...] "I Me Mine", a song inspired by the bickering and negativity within the band. It was met with ridicule by Lennon and an argument ensued between the two musicians, during which Lennon dismissed Harrison's abilities as a songwriter. According to Sulpy and Schweighardt, Lennon's resentment was most likely a reaction to Harrison's productivity throughout the sessions, since he himself was [...] "unable to write a decent new song". In addition, Harrison had <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> in voicing his objections to Ono's presence, telling the couple how, in Lennon's later recollection, [...] "Dylan and a few people said she's got a lousy name in New York".|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} {{alerted the}} remainder of the Australians and the company prepared for action. Considering it unlikely that the dead men had <b>been</b> <b>alone,</b> O'Donnell assessed that {{the remainder of}} a Viet Cong squad was located somewhere further along the track and he subsequently requested artillery fire to block any escape, while 2 Platoon was ordered to sweep forward. Under the command of Second Lieutenant Graham Ross, 2 Platoon commenced its advance before coming under automatic fire [...] along the track by a Viet Cong squad which then went to ground after the Australians returned fire. Attempting to take the initiative, Ross began to manoeuvre for a quick attack, moving two sections to the high ground on the right flank, while the third section provided fire support. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong force, {{which turned out to be}} larger than first thought by the Australians, also attempted a flanking manoeuvre, moving one squad into a defensive position while two squads moved to their left flank. Deploying to the high ground at about the same time the two assault groups came face to face and a fierce fire-fight followed at close range, with both sides throwing grenades in an attempt to gain the initiative. Two Australians were killed and several more were wounded in the initial clashes.|$|E

500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him she has <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> {{since she was}} sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} {{what it felt like}} to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, {{unable to}} leave the TARDIS due to the plague, gives Rory the lens, his sonic screwdriver, {{and a pair of}} glasses through which the Doctor can see and {{communicate}} with Rory. Rory explores the complex, and runs into a group of Handbots. The robots are quickly defeated by an older and bitter Amy, who is now a vigilante with the aid of Interface, but has otherwise been unable to escape. She is angry with the Doctor, telling him she has been waiting 36 years for rescue. [...] She has <b>been</b> <b>alone</b> except for a reprogrammed Handbot called [...] "Rory". The Doctor realises they have mistakenly latched onto the wrong time stream, and urges the older Amy to help find her younger self. She refuses, knowing that if the younger Amy is rescued, she will cease to exist. Though Rory considers saving the older Amy, the Doctor warns him that by taking her aboard the TARDIS, they will forgo any chance of rescuing the younger Amy. The Doctor discovers evidence of younger Amy nearby, and instructs Rory to use the lens to communicate with her, hoping that seeing the younger, crying Amy will convince the older one to help with the rescue. The older Amy remembers this discussion from when she was younger Amy and had failed to convince the older Amy to help. However, this time the younger Amy convinces the older Amy to change her mind by asking her to consider Rory. The older Amy agrees to help if the Doctor would take her too; the Doctor promises to do so despite the difficulty in completing the action since the TARDIS will be unable to handle the paradox of having two Amys from different timestreams aboard together.|$|E

2500|$|The case came to {{the fore}} in 1998, when Bill Clinton's {{attorneys}} invoked it as a defense to perjury charges brought by the House of Representatives during his impeachment.

Even though later testimony had established that she was indeed alone with him on several brief occasions, he had not specifically denied it and that the Jones lawyers' failure to ask follow-up questions about specific occasions barred prosecution as surely as the similar failure by Bronston's questioner. They also cited other occasions where Clinton had similarly claimed he didn't remember, and his questioners had simply left the answer at that. The president's purportedly false testimony was, to them, [...] "simply a confused deposition record that could have been clarified contemporaneously".|$|E
