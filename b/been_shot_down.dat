5|$|The Americans claimed 35 German {{aircraft}} destroyed. Only 14 can {{be judged}} {{with a degree}} of certainty to have <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by USAAF fighters, and possibly two more. Four are confirmed to have <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by AAA fire. Total JG 11 losses were 28. The air battle over Asch had lasted 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Likewise on 14February2007 {{the remains}} of Captain Donald Westbrook, of the 602d Special Operations Squadron who had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in 1968 while searching for {{possible}} survivors of the battle, were positively identified from remains which had been returned in September1998.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{strength}} of the American and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942. Air raids continued on targets further from Britain after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on American fighter aircraft. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> as far east as Aachen in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.|$|E
50|$|On 9 July MiG-15s intercepted 6 B-29s {{that were}} attacking the airfield, 1 MiG <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by escorting F-86s while another <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by B-29 gunners.|$|R
5000|$|... 20-22 April 1941: one SM.79 (278th Squadriglia, torpedo unit) <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on the 21st, another, from 34 Gruppo <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> {{the next}} day, by Fulmars from ...|$|R
50|$|V6 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on 21 August 1942 on the Taranto to Tripoli route by a Bristol Beaufighter; V8 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on {{the same}} route on 10 December 1942.|$|R
5|$|Overclaiming in {{aerial warfare}} is not uncommon. During the Second World War, pilots often claimed more {{aircraft}} shot down than {{was actually the}} case. The Air Ministry released a press statement on 15 September that 175–185 German aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> The actual number of aircraft destroyed was ⅔ lower and significantly less {{than the number of}} German losses on 15 and 18 August (The Hardest Day), in which the Luftwaffe lost 75 and 69 respectively.|$|E
5|$|USAF Captain Leo K. Thorsness {{was awarded}} the Medal of Honor and Capt Harold Johnson the Air Force Cross for an F-105F Wild Weasel mission on 19 April 1967, flying F-105F, serial number 63-8301. Thorsness and Johnson {{protected}} an attempted rescue of another Wild Weasel crew that had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> in the process destroying two MiG-17s. After running out of ammunition, Thorsness and Johnson continued to act as decoys to draw the MiGs away from the rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{five days}} and {{multiple}} attempts to rescue Hambleton, five aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and another 16 seriously damaged, 10 service members {{had been killed}} or were missing in action, two were POWs, and two were behind front lines also waiting to be rescued. On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure technology, that every effort {{should be made to}} bring him out.|$|E

5000|$|We {{had to send}} a U-2 over to gain {{reconnaissance}} {{information on}} whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, {{and that it would}} represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought [...] "Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack." [...] Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.|$|R
5|$|On 23 July 2014, two Su-25s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in the Donetsk {{region of}} Ukraine. A {{spokesperson}} for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said the aircraft <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by missiles fired from Russia.|$|R
5|$|Altogether JG 1 lost 25 {{pilots and}} 29 {{aircraft}}. This return for around 60 enemy aircraft (54 on the ground) cannot {{be considered a}} complete success, although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant. Just nine of the fighters lost by JG 1 are confirmed to have <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in combat with Spitfires. It is possible a further three were shot down by Spitfires, or perhaps ground fire. Two Spitfires were shot down and destroyed, with two more damaged. One pilot of each Squadron (308 and 317) was killed. The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32.|$|E
5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
5|$|His {{two younger}} {{brothers}} also became fighter pilots and aces. Paul claimed 17 victories, he <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and killed on 31 October 1942. Wilhelm-Ferdinand, credited with 54 victories, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and killed on 17 August 1943.|$|R
50|$|A Macedonian {{helicopter}} <b>was</b> allegedly <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> {{during the}} clashes; KFOR claims that a helicopter <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in the area, while Skopje denied the reports.|$|R
5000|$|... 7 August 1945: Two of the squadron’s Privateers {{were caught}} by ﬁve enemy ﬁghters {{in the area}} of Sagami Wan. One enemy {{aircraft}} <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and one of the squadron PB4Y-2 bombers <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in ﬂames, with no survivors.|$|R
5|$|MacLachlan's stay was unhappy. On 19 April 1943 he {{received}} news {{that his brother}} Gordon MacLachlan had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> over Brest, France while escorting B-24 bombers. They were intercepted by Focke-Wulf Fw 190s belonging to 1./Jagdgeschwader 2. Unteroffizier Erich Henning and Hauptmann Jürgen Heppe each claimed a Spitfire. 616 Squadron lost Gordon and Squadron leader Pip Lefevre. Lefevre survived and evaded capture, returning to Britain via Gibraltar. Gordon was killed and the Germans recovered the body and buried him at Plouguerneau. MacLachlan was bitter {{at the loss of}} his brother and was keen to get back into action against the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{continued}} the deception {{to reinforce the}} existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in The Times on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star Leslie Howard had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.|$|E
5|$|Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took {{command of}} No.467 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancasters {{in the air}} war over Europe. He led his unit through the Battle of Berlin from November 1943 to March 1944. In April {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Flying Cross, and the {{following}} month promoted to temporary group captain. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No.467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside Brussels.|$|E
50|$|On 8 October 1987, an LPAF Su-22M-22K <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by a FIM-92A Stinger missile in {{northern}} Chad. The pilot, Capt. Diya al-Din, ejected and was captured. The LPAF immediately organized a recovery operation; subsequently a Jamahiriya MiG-23 Flogger <b>was</b> also <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by another Stinger. In December 1988 a Libyan People's Air Force SF.260 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> over northern Chad by Chadian troops.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that no civil {{aircraft}} may <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> even if the aircraft {{is used as a}} weapon by terrorist. The {{court held that}} the passengers' dignity and right to life would be violated if the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1943, the Swiss {{military}} began attacking Allied aircraft breaching Swiss airspace. Six Allied aircraft <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by Swiss Air Force {{fighters and}} four by anti-aircraft cannons, killing 36 Allied airmen. The first Allied aircraft to <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> over <b>were</b> two British bombers flying low over Swiss territory {{on the night}} of July 12-13, 1943, which <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by Swiss anti-aircraft fire over Valais. The first American bomber <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> over Switzerland <b>was</b> downed near Bad Ragaz on October 1, 1943, and only three of its crew survived.|$|R
5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese flight decks at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted to augment the Combat Air Patrol. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight intercepting F4Fs.|$|E
5|$|An armed {{reconnaissance}} by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the low cloud base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by fighters, however, and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation was odd considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{had to wait}} a {{month for}} his next victory on 23 December 1940. Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) sent 100 bombers led by Kampfgruppe 100 to attack Manchester. GCI {{vectored}} Cunningham onto the enemy aircraft. It was not yet dark and Cunningham identified the machine as a Heinkel He 111. Flying at 15,000 feet, he saw the Heinkel above the Beaufighter at 16,500 feet. Cunningham engaged the enemy 50 miles south of West Lulworth. The enemy climbed to 19,000 feet. Following, Cunningham opened fire at 200–300 yards. The He 111 was engulfed in fire. The bomber was high enough for the crew to jettison the bombs and incendiaries and glide to France where it crash-landed at Cherbourg. Two of Feldwebel Georg Deininger's crew were wounded. The 3./KGr 100 machine was written off. The crew were unaware they had {{been a victim of}} a night-fighter. They supposed they had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by a flak ship.|$|E
5|$|The He 111Z's {{operational}} {{history was}} minimal. One machine {{was caught by}} RAF fighter aircraft over France on 14 March 1944. The He 111Z was towing a Gotha Go 242, and <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> Eight <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> or destroyed {{on the ground in}} 1944.|$|R
50|$|A {{day later}} he <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and wounded on 16 August 1940 (research {{shows that he}} <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by Helmut Wick).

5|$|The II./Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77; II Group Fighter Wing 77)—under {{the command}} of Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher—took off from Nordholz Airbase and intercepted No. 9 Squadron. Feldwebels Hans Troitzsch and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another. These {{aircraft}} from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to have <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by enemy fighters {{during the war and}} Troitzsch was most likely to have been the first enemy pilot to shoot one down. Another four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery fire. The Germans believed their air defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack. Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach.|$|E
5|$|When they {{returned}} to the fight a week later, the North Koreans employed guerrilla tactics with their aircraft, some continuing to use ROKAF markings and timing their strikes when UN patrols were out of the skies refueling. On July 10, seven Yak-7s were hidden at the captured Kimpo airfield and used in strikes against UN positions at Cheongju. The next day they surprised and damaged several F-80s in the area. On July 12, the Yak-7s shot down a B-29 bombing bridges in Seoul. Two more attacked a flight of F-80s flying over a battle at Chochiwon, damaging them. By {{the end of the day}} another UN L-4 had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> On July 15, two more Yaks ambushed a flight of B-26 aircraft near Taejon, forcing one to land. Airstrikes against UN ground positions at Taejon persisted until July 19. The North Korean aircraft strafed ground positions and also dropped propaganda leaflets signed by US prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|A diabetic, Keenor {{suffered}} from disabilities {{stemming from a}} hard-living lifestyle {{that may have been}} a consequence of his tough upbringing. Following his retirement from football, he found it difficult to find work due to his ill-health and it became increasingly hard to earn money. Supporters of his former club Cardiff City held a collection during one league match to raise money for Keenor and his family and the Football Association of Wales also organised a fund for him as well as donating him some money. After a long spell in hospital for treatment of his diabetes, Keenor moved his family to Lamberhurst where he and his wife ran a corner shop and also raised chickens to be sold at Christmas time. He later volunteered for the Territorial Army, serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, but was discharged in June 1939 due to continuing problems with his diabetes treatment, just months {{before the start of the}} Second World War. Two of his sons, Frederick and Alfred were both killed in action during the conflict. Keenor and his wife later visited the village of Fruges in northern France where Alfred's plane had <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
50|$|Michael Enslin, 21 {{years of}} age the time, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in a BAe Hawk at 1000 feet while {{recovering}} from a dive. He survived for 5 days in the bush until he was rescued. He was the third pilot to <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
