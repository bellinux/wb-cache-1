25|$|The Deathly Hallows {{are three}} magical {{objects that are}} the focus of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – an unbeatable wand, a stone to bring the dead to life, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are {{generally}} remembered only as part of a wizard's fairy tale called The Tale of the Three Brothers, and have become mythological over time, but a small number of wizards including Dumbledore still <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> existence and seek them. According to Rowling, the story about how these objects came into existence is based upon Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale.|$|E

Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as [...] "a bland and minimally talented young actress" [...] Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe stated, [...] "Connelly {{is simply the}} wrong person for the right job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, {{you can see the}} onions in her eyes."

500|$|The {{innovator}} {{does not}} tend to {{care much about}} free speech, since they engage in innovation despite social resistance. Innovators may be separated into three categories: the hard millenarians, who <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> doctrine {{to the exclusion of}} all others, and who only seek to protect the dissemination of their own creeds; the virtuous millenarians, who emphasise that revolutionary transitions must begin through rational persuasion and the guidance of sages, and so are supportive of free speech; and the progressives, who cannot foresee the direction of future progress, but recognise that the free exchange of ideas is a prerequisite to it. For the philosopher, free speech allows people to engage in rational doubt, and to grow in their prudential duties. (Russell 1938:182–185) ...|$|E

500|$|Disraeli {{spoke in}} favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was [...] "completed Judaism", and asking the House of Commons [...] "Where is your Christianity {{if you do not}} <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Judaism?" [...] Russell and Disraeli's future rival Gladstone thought it brave of him to speak as he did; [...] the speech was badly {{received}} by his own party. The Tories and the Anglican establishment were hostile to the bill. Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, spoke strongly against the measure and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for helping elect him. With the exception of Disraeli, every member of the future protectionist cabinet then in Parliament voted against the measure. One who was not yet an MP, Lord John Manners, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. [...] Disraeli, who had attended the Protectionists dinner at the Merchant Taylors Hall, joined Bentinck in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration. The measure was voted down.|$|E

500|$|Through the {{depiction}} of the polytheism of Ansul, Le Guin suggests that their beliefs make them more tolerant of religious difference. The Alds refer {{to those who do}} not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> god as heathens. Memer, however, thinks to herself that [...] "If [...] meant anything, it meant people who don’t know what’s sacred. Are there any such people? 'Heathen' is merely a word for somebody who knows a different sacredness than you know." [...] Literature scholar Elizabeth Anderson argues that Le Guin's critique is directed more at religious fundamentalism than at monotheism. The Alds' beliefs are more complex than Memer believes: while they despise writing, they value poetry and spoken words, and are moved by Orrec's recitations. While Le Guin criticizes the violence of the Alds, she also depicts the failed violent uprising in a negative light. A diplomatic settlement is ultimately what ends the conflict, though Memer acknowledges her unsatisfied desire for revenge as Iddor and his followers are escorted out of Ansul to be tried for treason.|$|E
500|$|As {{late as the}} Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists {{could still}} <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{eventual}} victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised {{the independence of the}} American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, [...] "I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I {{would be the first to}} meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power." ...|$|E
500|$|Religion is a {{significant}} theme in [...] "Paradises Lost". According to speculative fiction scholar Brian Attebery, the novella {{was a response to}} a rise in religious fundamentalism in the U.S. and elsewhere. Le Guin reacted to the tendency within Christian, Islamic, and Hindu fundamentalism to reject scientific thinking and social change, and to use shared beliefs as armor against political pressure. Le Guin said in her introduction to the story that she was unable to start [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] until she worked in the religious theme, which in her words [...] "began to entwine itself with the idea of the sealed ship in the dead vacuum of space, like a cocoon, full of transformation, transmutation, invisible life: the pupa body, the winged soul". The adherents of Bliss believe {{they are part of a}} eternal voyage towards perfection; its beliefs specifically address phobias that develop in the enclosed space of the ship. Attebery writes that the story serves as a parable for the role of religion on Earth, but that the setting of a generation ship prevents the [...] "parallel from [...] too obtrusive." [...] The story also explores why certain characters are resistant to the allure of Bliss; by discussing their background and upbringing, Attebery says, Le Guin [...] "helps us <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> ability to choose a tough material reality".|$|E

This resulted in several attempts to prove illegal enslavement, numerous confrontations with the guardianship system - one of the guises of slavery - and various other demands with interesting implications. Thus, their daily resistance exposed the vicissitudes of the relations between liberated Africans and public administrators, as well as the conditions to which the former were submitted in the jobs to which they were assigned...|$|R

The lyrics of the closing song, seemingly telling the viewer [...] "Don't stop believin'," [...] are thought to support this, while the silent black screen space before the credits is meant to allow people to imagine and <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own continuations of Tony's story.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Colin Mackerras states, [...] "There {{was a major}} {{rebellion}} against Chinese rule in Tibet in March 1959, which was put down {{with the cost of}} much bloodshed and lasting bitterness {{on the part of the}} Tibetans." [...] The Tibetan government-in-exile reports variously, 85,000, 86,000, and 87,000 deaths for Tibetans during the rebellion, attributed to [...] "secret Chinese documents captured by guerrillas". Tibetologist Tom Grunfeld said [...] "the veracity of such a claim is difficult to verify." [...] Warren W. Smith, a writer with Radio Free Asia, writes that the [...] "secret documents" [...] came from a 1960 PLA report captured by guerrillas in 1966, with the figures first published by the TGIE in India in 1990. Smith states that the documents said that 87,000 [...] "enemies were eliminated", but he does not take [...] "eliminated" [...] to mean [...] "killed", as the TGIE does. A Tibetan Government in Exile (TGIE) official surnamed Samdup released a report for Asia Watch after three fact-finding missions from 1979 to 1981, stating that a speech by premier Zhou Enlai, published in Beijing Review in 1980, confirmed the 87,000 figure.
