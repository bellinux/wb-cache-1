40|$|Growing {{numbers of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality due to the cancer and coronary heart disease is recognized as the increasing challenge in the world. The initial stage of these diseases, early diagnosis and treatment are the main objectives of current researches. According to Lithuanian Health Information Centre {{morbidity and mortality}} due to these diseases in Lithuania exceed average of European Union. The oxidative stress occurs in cells as a result of normal physiological processes and environmental interactions, and the complex antioxidant defense system are of particular importance in protecting biological systems against oxidative damage by free radicals. Recently polyphenols and anthocyanins containing foods and preparations have attracted attention due to their health promoting benefits. Anthocyanins make one of the main groups of flavonoids, and represent polyphenolic compounds, that are found in vegetables and fruits, particularly in berries. An important effect of anthocyanins is the scavenging of oxygen-derived free radicals. They can interfere with few different free radical-producing systems, and can increase the function of the endogenous antioxidants. The aim of the research is to choose sources for the products with antioxidant activity from plants cultivated in Lithuania, evaluate quality and antioxidant activity of <b>black</b> <b>currant,</b> red currant and chokeberry products, to develop and evaluate technologies of phytopharmaceuticals with antioxidant activity. Innovation and practical significance of the research. Antioxidant activity of Lithuanian <b>black</b> <b>currant,</b> red currant and chokeberry berries concentrated juices was evaluated for the first time. There were applied DPPH and ABTS methods for these products. These results will bring antioxidant activity data performed by world scientists up-to-date. Dry product from Lithuanian <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> berries juices was made by spry draying. Production of tablets with <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> polyphenols (and athocyanins) was made {{for the first time in}} Lithuania. Two products with antioxidant activity were prepared for industry: tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and vitamin premix (vitamins E, C and β-carotene). Experimental series of tablets was produced, quality and stability was evaluated. Composition of tablet was optimized by experimental design. Scientific technological documentation for tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and vitamin premix was prepared. Results The stability of polyphenols and anthocyanins is significantly influenced by storage conditions of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry concentrated juices. It is recommended to store <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry concentrated juices at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. The results demonstrated insufficient stability of juice concentrates, and impossibility of application of long lasting drying processes in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry berries dry products manufacturing. Fast and efficient drying methods for liquid products should be applied to preserve qualitative and quantitative composition and their antioxidant activity. Only complex approach to quality evaluation of natural origin products presents reliable basis for establishment of product value. Determined contents of polyphenols and anthocyanins in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> product were higher and it possessed stronger antioxidant activity if compared to chokeberry. Therefore <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> concentrated juice was chosen for further processing and development of solid dosage form possessing antioxidant activity. Spray drying procedure was performed in Medical University of Gdansk, department of Pharmaceutical technology (Poland). Spry drier „ANHYDRO“ type LAB – S 1 (Denmark) was used for this procedure. <b>Black</b> <b>currant</b> juice concentrate was diluted with water (1 : 1) and 10 % of amorphous silica was admixed to the water-diluted concentrate. The resulting powder was dry and non-sticky. Other used product was <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins. Conclusions Researches were performed at 2001 - 2005. During this period there were analyzed and evaluated <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> (Ribes nigrum L.), chokeberry (Chokeberry melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) and red currant (Ribes rubrum L.) berries concentrated juices as raw material for production of preparations with antioxidant activity. There were produced tablets with spry dried <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> berries juices; tablets with <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins; and tablets with standardized (7 % anthocyanins) <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract and vitamin (E, C, β-carotene) mixture. Quality and stability of these tablets were evaluated. It can be concluded: 1. <b>Black</b> <b>currant</b> extract was chosen for production of antioxidant preparations. Results showed higher amount of polyphenols 3786, 25 ± 180 mg/l GAE (p= 0, 0193) and antioxidant activity 78, 49 ± 3, 9 % (p= 0, 0003) of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices then in chokeberry juices. Results showed low antioxidant activity, small amounts polyphenols and anthocyanins of red currant juices. Therefore red currant analysis was not continued. 2. Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods were applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis; Acceptability of these methods was validated for analysis of raw material and stability of tablets. 3. Polyphenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity significantly decreased after storage at 20 ± 0, 5 and 40 ± 0, 5 ºC temperatures. Best stability was determinated at 2 ± 0, 5 ºC temperature (p< 0, 001). It is recommended to store <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> and chokeberry concentrated juices at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. 4. Dependence of antioxidant activity on anthocyanin amount was determinated (r= 0, 76). Anthocyanins in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices were more stabile (p= 0, 0062) then in chokeberry juices. 5. Spray drying was applied for <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices, conditions of drying were determinated. Spry dried product is appropriate for production of solid dosage forms due to good technological properties. 6. Tablets with dry concentrate of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices were produced, appropriate excipients were chosen for good quality tablet production by direct pressing. Analysis confirmed quality and stability of tablets with dry concentrate of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> juices. 7. Two technologies of tablets with standardized <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract, standardized <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract and vitamin mixture (vitamins E, C and β-carotene) were studied as potential antioxidant phytopharmaceuticals. Tablets technology of these two compositions was established, quality and stability were evaluated. Tablet composition with standardized <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> extract was optimized by orthogonal full factorial design model. Optimal mounts of excipients were determinated: 18, 0 mg of silica, colloidal anhydrous, 3, 5 mg of magnesium stearate and 278, 5 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. Results satisfied Europe pharmacopeias requirements for tablet quality. 8.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in the inclusion of berries, especially the <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> in the human diet mainly for the health benefits associated with their consumption. <b>Black</b> <b>currant</b> (Ribes nigrum L.) belonging to the genus Ribes is widely cultivated across temperate Europe, Russia, New Zealand, parts of Asia {{and to a lesser}} extent North America. Besides high content of tasty juice, <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> is a valuable source of bioactive compounds like vitamin C and polyphenols, acting as antioxidants, with a potential to protect against disorders such as cardiovascular events, cancer and other degenerative symptoms. Industrially, <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> fruits are considered to be of importance; however other anatomical parts like buds and leaves are also excellent sources of phenolic compounds. The leaf and bud extracts are of relevance as raw material for the food and health industry thereby making <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> a lucrative product for use as functional food ingredient. Research until now has investigated the content of different polyphenolic fractions of the fruits and to lesser extent on content of these fractions on plant parts like buds and leaves. The breeding of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> is mainly focussed on national and international requirements, as related to specific quality desired from the processing sector alongside with important agronomic characters. <b>Black</b> <b>currant</b> cultivation is in different areas limited by a lack of climate adaptation in the existing cultivars as well as susceptibility of these cultivars to different pests and diseases. Also, the levels of bioactive compounds in <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> like content of ascorbic acid and polyphenols are influenced by genotype, environment and genotype x environment interactions. Durable resistance towards damaging pest and diseases together with an increase in content of health promoting compounds and adaptability to local climates remain to be of high priority for breeders. Additionally flavour, mouth feel, aroma and after taste are important primary quality factors for the fresh fruit market and juice industry. This introductory paper focuses on the history of development and biology of black currant; their ecology and environmental adaptability; crop utilisation; bioactive compounds, genetic, biochemical and phenotypic diversity.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pre-harvest MJ application on the increase of the main flavonoids and the antioxidant properties of <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> (Ribes nigrum) cultivars. [Results] Significant enhancement of individual and total anthocyanins was measured after elicitation with MJ, particularly when 0. 2 mM concentrations were used. Total anthocyanins increased from 28288. 74 [*]±[*] 253. 65 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 to 43561. 08 [*]±[*] 145. 87 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 in Ben Hope <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> after elicitation with 0. 2 mM MJ.
