40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{the past}} 20 years, the {{emphasis}} for avoiding dengue epidemics {{has focused on}} <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> of Aedes aegypti, the principal mosquito vector of dengue viruses. A general consensus is that mosquito <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> holds the best promise for reducing dengue epidemics, although its actual effectiveness is still unknown and subject to {{a great deal of}} uncertainty. The objective of this research was to assess the cost-effectiveness of emergency <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> programs for reducing dengue transmission in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico and to develop guidelines to help choose between carrying out a rapid-response, emergency <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> intervention and not conducting such an intervention. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on dengue transmission and its likely impacts in Puerto Rico were used as a case study to develop intervention guidelines. A distribution of economic impacts was simulated using available data on disease rates and economic variables, including the costs of treating patients and the opportunity costs represented by lost wages. Successful <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> interventions were assessed by determining two parameters: (1) the costs of an intervention and (2) the expected reduction in the reported case rate of dengue. In addition, we examined how these guidelines would change with an early warning system that provides information on a possible outbreak of dengue. RESULTS: In Puerto Rico, <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> programs that are expected to reduce dengue transmission by 50 % and cost less than US$ 2. 50 per person will be cost-effective. Programs that cost more per person but that further reduce transmission are still likely to be cost-effective. Having an early warning system, even one that provides a low level of accuracy, can extend the range of <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> programs that are cost-effective. For example, with an early warning system, a <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> program that reduces dengue transmission by 50 % and that costs less than US$ 4. 50 per person would be expected to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines such as the ones that we developed for Puerto Rico can be useful to public health authorities in helping {{to decide whether or not}} to spend resources for a <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> program to reduce dengue transmission. The range of <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> interventions that are cost-effective can be increased by having an early warning system that provides even a small amount of information regarding possible outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|The {{two main}} {{interventions}} presently being deployed {{for control of}} malaria vectors, that is, long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) involve the use of chemical insecticides and target adult mosquitoes. Meanwhile, the potential of <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> is increasingly being acknowledged for the reduction of insecticide-resistant and/or exophagic Anopheles populations. <b>Larval</b> <b>control</b> {{has proven to be}} cost-effective and ideal for localities where mosquito-breeding sites are well defined and approachable. Utilising biological control tools to control anopheline larvae can lower the problem of resistance development, a common feature of chemical control. Fortunately, there are many options of biological <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> tools. Besides their direct impact on mortality, the effects of these tools can reach beyond the larval stage.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of impregnated mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying and <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> relative to the impacts of climate variability in the decline of malaria cases in Eritrea. Methods: Monthly data on clinical malaria cases by subzoba (district) in three zobas (zones) of Eritrea for 1998 â€“ 2003 were used in Poisson regression models {{to determine whether there}} is statistical evidence for reduction in cases by DDT, malathion, impregnated nets and <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> used over the period, while analysing the effects of satellite-derived climate variables in the same geographic areas. Results: Both indoor residual spraying (with DDT or malathion) and impregnated nets were independently and significantly negatively associated with reduction in cases, as was <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> in one zoba. Malaria cases were significantly positively related to differences in current and previous monthsâ€™ vegetation (NDVI) anomalies. The relationship to rainfall differences 2 and 3 months previously was also significant, but the direction of the effect varied by zoba. Standardized regression coefficients indicated a greater effect of climate in the zoba with less intense malaria transmission. Conclusion: The results support the view that both indoor residual spraying and impregnated nets have been independently effective against malaria, and that <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> was also effective in one area. Thus climate, while significant, is not the only explanation for the recent decline in malaria cases in Eritrea. If appropriate statistical approaches are used, routine surveillance data from cases attending health facilities can be useful for assessing control programme success and providing estimates of {{the effectiveness of}} individual control measures.

40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{investigate the}} influence of <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> methods (using temephos, keeping fish and covering containers with lids), water use and weekly cleaning of containers {{on the presence of}} Aedes aegypti larvae in water-storage containers in rural and urban households in Khon Kaen province. method Cross-sectional questionnaire survey and larval survey covered 966 households and 5821 containers were inspected. result In rural and urban areas <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> was patchy and often ineffective. Consequently, the mosquito indices exceed the target indices for dengue control with the Breteau Indices of 201 and 113, and Container Indices of 25 and 28 in rural and urban areas, respectively. The containers most fre-quently infested with larvae were rectangular cement containers storing water for bathing (rural: 37. 2 %; urban: 35 %) and flushing the toilets (rural: 35. 7 %; urban: 34. 3 %). Keeping fish [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) : 0. 08 â€“ 0. 16] was the most effective methods of control. Correctly covering containers with lids was similarly effective (AOR: 0. 10 â€“ 0. 25) when used on jars for storing drinking water. However, frequent use of containers reduced the effectiveness of lids. Temephos was effective only in dragon jars in urban areas (AOR: 0. 46) where a standard package of temephos were available. Weekly cleaning of containers was an effective method for <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> in most types of containers. A combination of control methods increased effectiveness. conclusion This study highlights the complex interaction of household water use and <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> practices as well as the importance of determining the most effective control measures compatible with water practices for implementing control promotion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Based on {{sensitivity}} {{analysis of the}} MacDonald-Ross model, {{it has long been}} argued {{that the best way to}} reduce malaria transmission is to target adult female mosquitoes with insecticides that can reduce the longevity and human-feeding frequency of vectors. However, these analyses have ignored a fundamental biological difference between mosquito adults and the immature stages that precede them: adults are highly mobile flying insects that can readily detect and avoid many intervention measures whereas mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae are confined within relatively small aquatic habitats and cannot readily escape control measures. Presentation of the hypothesis We hypothesize that the control of adult but not immature mosquitoes is compromised by their ability to avoid interventions such as excito-repellant insecticides. Testing the hypothesis We apply a simple model of intervention avoidance by mosquitoes and demonstrate that this can substantially reduce effective coverage, in terms of the proportion of the vector population that is covered, and overall impact on malaria transmission. We review historical evidence that <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> of African malaria vectors can be effective and conclude that the only limitations to the effective coverage of <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> are practical rather than fundamental.

We simultaneously monitored female oviposition and juvenile development in 80 experimental containers located across 20 houses in Iquitos, Peru, {{to test the hypothesis}} that Ae. aegypti oviposit preferentially in sites with the greatest potential for maximizing offspring fitness. Females consistently laid more eggs in large vs. small containers (Î²â€Š=â€Š 9. 18, p< 0. 001), and in unmanaged vs. manually filled containers (Î²â€Š=â€Š 5. 33, p< 0. 001). Using microsatellites to track the development of immature Ae. aegypti, we found a negative correlation between oviposition preference and pupation probability (Î²â€Š=â€Š- 3. 37, p< 0. 001). Body size of emerging adults was also negatively associated with the preferred oviposition site characteristics of large size (females: Î²â€Š=â€Š- 0. 19, p< 0. 001; males: Î²â€Š=â€Š- 0. 11, pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 002) and non-management (females: Î²â€Š=â€Š- 0. 17, p< 0. 001; males: Î²â€Š=â€Š- 0. 11, p< 0. 001). Inside a semi-field enclosure, we simulated a container elimination campaign targeting the most productive oviposition sites. Compared to the two post-intervention trials, egg batches were more clumped during the first pre-intervention trial (Î²â€Š=â€Š- 0. 17, P< 0. 001), but not the second (Î²â€Š=â€Š 0. 01, pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 900).

Understanding larval habitat succession and its ecology in different land use managements and cropping systems can give an insight for effective larval source management practices. This study investigated larval habitat succession and ecological parameters which influence larval abundance in malaria epidemic prone areas of western Kenya. A total of 51 aquatic habitats positive for anopheline larvae were surveyed and visited once a week for a period of 85 weeks in succession. Habitats were selected and identified. Mosquito larval species, physico-chemical parameters, habitat size, grass cover, crop cycle and distance to nearest house were recorded. Polymerase chain reaction revealed that An. gambiae s. l was the most dominant vector species comprised of An. gambiae s. s (77. 60 %) and An. arabiensis (18. 34 %), the remaining 4. 06 % had no amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Physico-chemical parameters and habitat size significantly influenced abundance of An. gambiae s. s (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 024) and An. arabiensis (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 002) larvae. Further, larval species abundance was influenced by crop cycle (Pâ‰¤ 0. 001), grass cover (Pâ‰¤ 0. 001), while distance to nearest houses significantly influenced the abundance of mosquito species larvae (râ€Š=â€Š 0. 920;Pâ‰¤ 0. 001).

We {{have used}} a {{relatively}} simple but accurate model for predicting the impact of integrated transmission control on the malaria entomologic inoculation rate (EIR) at four endemic sites from across sub-Saharan Africa and the southwest Pacific. The simulated campaign incorporated modestly effective vaccine coverage, bed net use, and <b>larval</b> <b>control.</b> The results indicate that such campaigns would reduce EIRs at all four sites by 30 - to 50 -fold. Even without the vaccine, 15 - to 25 -fold reductions of EIR were predicted, implying that integrated control with a few modestly effective tools can meaningfully reduce malaria transmission {{in a range of}} endemic settings. The model accurately predicts the effects of bed nets and indoor spraying and demonstrates that they are the most effective tools available for reducing EIR. However, the impact of domestic adult vector control is amplified by measures for reducing the rate of emergence of vectors or the level of infectiousness of the human reservoir. We conclude that available tools, including currently neglected methods for <b>larval</b> <b>control,</b> can reduce malaria transmission intensity enough to alleviate mortality.

However, an integrated approach to malaria <b>control,</b> including <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> methods, continues to be the best chance for success, in view of insecticide resistance, the behavioural adaptation of the vectors to changing environments and the difficulties of reaching the poorest populations most at risk,. Laboratory studies investigating the effects of neem seed (Azadirachta indica) extracts on Anopheles larvae have shown high rates of larval mortality and reductions in adult longevity, as well as low potential for resistance development. Methods This paper describes a method whereby seeds of the neem tree can be used to reduce adult Anopheles gambiae s. l. abundance {{in a way that is}} low cost and can be implemented by residents of rural villages in western Niger. The study was conducted in Banizoumbou village, western Niger. Neem seeds were collected from around the village. Dried seeds were ground into a coarse powder, which was then sprinkled onto known Anopheles larvae breeding habitats twice weekly during the rainy season 2007. Adult mosquitoes were captured on a weekly basis in the village and captures compared to those from 2005 and 2006 over the same period. Adult mosquitoes were also captured in a nearby village, Zindarou, as a control data set and compared to those from Banizoumbou. Results It was found that twice-weekly applications of the powder to known breeding habitats of Anopheles larvae in 2007 resulted in 49 % fewer adult female Anopheles gambiae s. l. mosquitoes in Banizoumbou, compared with previous captures under similar environmental conditions and with similar habitat characteristics in 2005 and 2006. The productivity of the system in 2007 was found to be suppressed compared to the mean behaviour of 2005 and 2006 in Banizoumbou, whereas no change was found in Zindarou.

40|$|Background: <b>Larval</b> <b>control</b> {{of malaria}} vectors has been {{historically}} successful in reducing malaria transmission, but largely {{fell out of}} favour {{with the introduction of}} synthetic insecticides and bed nets. However, an integrated approach to malaria <b>control,</b> including <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> methods, continues to be the best chance for success, in view of insecticide resistance, the behavioural adaptation of the vectors to changing environments and the difficulties of reaching the poorest populations most at risk,. Laboratory studies investigating the effects of neem seed (Azadirachta indica) extracts on Anopheles larvae have shown high rates of larval mortality and reductions in adult longevity, as well as low potential for resistance development. Methods: This paper describes a method whereby seeds of the neem tree can be used to reduce adult Anopheles gambiae s. l. abundance {{in a way that is}} low cost and can be implemented by residents of rural villages in western Niger. The study was conducted in Banizoumbou village, western Niger. Neem seeds were collected from around the village. Dried seeds were ground into a coarse powder, which was then sprinkled onto known Anopheles larvae breeding habitats twice weekly during the rainy season 2007. Adult mosquitoes were captured on a weekly basis in the village and captures compared to those from 2005 and 2006 over the same period. Adult mosquitoes were also captured in a nearby village, Zindarou, as a control data set and compared to those from Banizoumbou. Results: It was found that twice-weekly applications of the powder to known breeding habitats of Anopheles larvae in 2007 resulted in 49 % fewer adult female Anopheles gambiae s. l. mosquitoes in Banizoumbou, compared with previous captures under similar environmental conditions and with similar habitat characteristics in 2005 and 2006. The productivity of the system in 2007 was found to be suppressed compared to the mean behaviour of 2005 and 2006 in Banizoumbou, whereas no change was found in Zindarou.

40|$|Background & objectives: <b>Larval</b> <b>control</b> is an {{integral}} part of malaria vector management in Ethiopia andelsewhere. For effective <b>larval</b> <b>control,</b> a sound understanding of the factors responsible for spatio-temporalvariation in larval production is essential. A study was thus conducted to characterize larval habitats of anophelinemosquitoes in irrigation and major drainage areas between Adami Tulu and Meki towns, in the middle course ofthe Ethiopian Rift Valley. Methods: Aquatic habitats were sampled for anopheline larvae and the associated environmental variables(water temperature, turbidity, water current, water pH and other variables) were measured, characterized andanalyzed. Results: Microscopic identification of the late instars (III and IV) of anopheline larvae collected throughout thestudy period yielded nearly 47. 6 % Anopheles pharoensis, 32. 1 % An. arabiensis, 17. 1 % An. squamosus and only 3. 2 % of other species (An. coustani and An. cinereus). Larvae of the local malaria vectors, An. arabiensis andAn. pharoensis were most abundantly sampled from sand pools and natural swamps, respectively. Logisticregression analysis detected four best predictor variables associated with larval abundance of malaria vectorspecies. Thus, relative abundance of An. arabiensis larvae was significantly and inversely associated with aquaticvegetation and water current, whereas the relative abundance of An. pharoensis larvae was significantly andpositively associated with water temperature and the presence of algae in the water bodies. Conclusion: Dry season anopheline larval habitats such as riverine sand pools that are created and maintainedby perennial water bodies and their associated water development projects need to be considered in vectorcontrol operations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{successful}} {{control of}} malaria vectors requires {{the control of}} both the larval and adult stages. The adult control methods through indoor residual spraying (IRS) and use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) continue to be widely used with some high measure of success. <b>Larval</b> <b>control</b> methods are also being used {{by a number of}} National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) with limited understanding of its contribution. <b>Larval</b> <b>control</b> might be needed in some areas to move from malaria control to elimination. This experimental study was conducted to assess the field effectiveness of winter larviciding on the larval stages of the mosquito in Botswana and Zimbabwe. METHODS : Two villages were selected in each of the two countries, one as an intervention and the other as the control. Water bodies in the intervention villages were treated using the commercial product VectoBacÂ® WG (Valent BioSciences Corporation, IL, USA) containing the active ingredient Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), a WHO recommended bio-larvicide, applied at a rate of 300 g per hectare. Random-effects Poisson regression was employed during data analysis to compare intervention with control sites with respect to larval counts. RESULTS : The average marginal effect of larviciding on the mosquito larvae taking interaction with time (period) into account, was âˆ’ 1. 94 (95 % CI âˆ’ 2. 42 to âˆ’ 1. 46) with incidence rate ratio of 0. 14, thus an 86 % larval reduction attributable to the intervention for both countries combined. There was a 92 % and 65 % effect for Botswana and Zimbabwe respectively. The effect on the early larval and late stages was 77 % (P < 0. 001) and 91 % (P < 0. 001), respectively. Overall, intervention larval sampling points had five more larvae than the control at baseline and 26 less after 16 weeks. The effect on the different species also showed similar trends. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION : <b>Larval</b> <b>control</b> using Bti showed a high effect on the population of the mosquito larvae. The reduction of the early and late larval stages can lead to reduced adult mosquito emergence and low adult mosquito densities. Larviciding can be used to control mosquito vector population by suppressing the larval stages thereby reducing adult emergence and malaria risk.

40|$|Abstract Background Half of the {{population}} of Africa will soon live in towns and cities where it can be protected from malaria by controlling aquatic stages of mosquitoes. Rigorous but affordable and scaleable methods for mapping and managing mosquito habitats are required to enable effective <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> in urban Africa. Methods A simple community-based mapping procedure that requires no electronic devices in the field was developed to facilitate routine larval surveillance in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The mapping procedure included (1) community-based development of sketch maps and (2) verification of sketch maps through technical teams using laminated aerial photographs in the field which were later digitized and analysed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Results Three urban wards of Dar es Salaam were comprehensively mapped, covering an area of 16. 8 km 2. Over thirty percent of this area were not included in preliminary community-based sketch mapping, mostly because they were areas that do not appear on local government residential lists. The use of aerial photographs and basic GIS allowed rapid identification and inclusion of these key areas, as well as more equal distribution of the workload of malaria control field staff. Conclusion The procedure developed enables complete coverage of targeted areas with <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> through comprehensive spatial coverage with community-derived sketch maps. The procedure is practical, affordable, and requires minimal technical skills. This approach can be readily integrated into malaria vector control programmes, scaled up to towns and cities all over Tanzania and adapted to urban settings elsewhere in Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{the most}} {{effective}} means of malaria vector control is the killing of adult mosquitoes with a residual insecticide applied to bed nets or sprayed on house walls and ceilings. Major reductions in all-cause child mortality have been achieved in Africa by these means. In some circumstances, personal protection and <b>larval</b> <b>control</b> may also make a contribution. We discuss the prospects of genetic control by release of sterile male mosquitoes or driving genes for refractoriness to malaria into wild populations. Many major malaria vectors belong to complexes of sibling species which differ in vectorial and biological characteristics. Distinguishing the species by cytogenetic or molecular methods is important for epidemiological studies and could improve the targeting of control...|$|R
