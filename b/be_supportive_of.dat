5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna know much more about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E

However, it issued a statement mourning the death of Kim Jong-il. Since the overturn of socialism in the Soviet bloc, the CPC (ML) has largely abandoned its previously strident anti-revisionist position. The CPC (ML) has become strongly supportive of Cuba and the Cuban Revolution and now has close relations with the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa. It prints the English language edition of the Cuban Communist Party's newspaper, Granma, for Canadian distribution.|$|E
25|$|The Irish {{physician}} and inventor, William Reid Clanny, {{who had moved}} to nearby Sunderland, introduced Jane to Sir Robert Peat, a sycophantic chaplain of the Prince Regent.

Jane was taken {{with the idea of}} a title if she were to marry Peat, but was afraid to put her wealth at the disposal of a husband. When Sir Robert proposed to Jane, he was heard to have said that she would never marry as long as Herrington House still stood.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian {{information}} technology (IT) sector {{is made up}} equally of women and men, {{with large numbers of}} women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are interested in IT, this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of upward social mobility. Malaysia's push to develop an endogenous research culture should deepen this trend.|$|E

25|$|With regular police {{raids on}} people known to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> the Angry Brigade and with Mendleson a wanted person (although for cheque fraud only), {{the police were}} {{interested}} in finding any addresses where she might be found. Mendleson was keeping in regular touch with her family in Stockport and a police informer there passed the Amhurst Road address to police on 18 August 1971. An observation was set up and when Jim Greenfield was seen leaving the flat, a search warrant was obtained. At 4:15 PM on 20 August the police entered the flat and arrested Mendleson, Creek, Barker and Greenfield. Mendleson again gave her name as 'Nancy Pye'. The police reported that their searches of 359 Amhurst Road discovered not only duplicating equipment on which Angry Brigade publications had been produced, but a stick of gelignite, two submachine guns, a Browning pistol and 81 rounds of ammunition. Mendleson was remanded in custody at Holloway Prison and was eventually charged with possession of the armaments and conspiracy to cause explosions. Mendleson's fingerprints were found on a copy of Rolling Stone magazine used to wrap a bomb planted at the Italian consulate in Manchester, and she was also charged with attempting to cause this explosion.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{initially}} {{refused to}} endorse {{either side of}} the debate in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, citing the abuse he had received after his comments in 2006. Just before the referendum, Murray tweeted a message that was considered by the media to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> independence. He received online abuse for expressing his opinion, including messages that were described as [...] "vile" [...] by Police Scotland; one referred to the Dunblane massacre. A few days after the vote, in which a 55% majority opposed Scottish independence, Murray said that he did not regret stating his view, but said that it was out of character and that he would concentrate on his tennis career in the future.|$|E

500|$|Will's wife, Terri, {{returns to}} the series in [...] "Funk", giving her first vocal performance. Murphy planned a redemptive storyline for Terri, in which she realizes that Finn is similar to Will. He explained: [...] "She met Will at 16, so she sees a way to redemption... a way to redo that {{relationship}} {{in a positive way}} [...] almost as Finn's guardian angel, his fairy godmother. She gives him proper moral advice." [...] Murphy enjoyed seeing Gilsig and Monteith work together, so much so that he stated their friendship will continue into the show's second season. On June 2, 2010, Megan Masters of E! Online reported that Gilsig had yet to be officially invited back for the second season, but was confident that she would be. Discussing Terri's relationship with Finn, Gilsig explained: [...] "She sees in Finn so much of what she saw in Will when she first met him because he's the same age as Will was. It's her way of remembering happier times—when she used to be kind to Will. And she realizes, here's a chance to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> this kid." ...|$|E

[...] On May 2 the New York Daily News published a brief item about Giuliani's other woman, without name or description. [...] On May 3 the New York Post finally published its photographs of Giuliani and the woman, now identified as Judith Nathan, leaving a restaurant together, under the front page headline [...] "Rudy's Mystery Brunch Pal is Upper East Side Divorcée". [...] (Some observers felt that Giuliani, known {{for his ability to}} manipulate the New York media, had been eager for news of the relationship to come out.) [...] Later that day, Giuliani responded to a barrage of questions on the subject at a news conference by acknowledging Judith Nathan publicly for the first time, calling her [...] "a very good friend" [...] and expressing his annoyance that her privacy was being invaded. [...] The next days were filled with New York media coverage on Nathan's background and on the relationship. [...] On May 6 Hanover held an unusually-located news conference at the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral before the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor; visibly trembling, she said, [...] "I will <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> Rudy in his fight against his illness, as this marriage and this man have been very precious to me." [...] The following day half the press tried to stake out Nathan's known locations while the rest pestered Nathan's hometown relatives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Giuliani looked weak in a public appearance.|$|E
500|$|Rachel's {{cover of}} [...] "Firework" [...] by Katy Perry was {{reviewed}} negatively by Coachman. She wrote, [...] "I'm not loving Michele’s vocals on this track. It {{was like they}} wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T." [...] by Michael Jackson and [...] "When I get You Alone" [...] by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no Freddie Mercury, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger." ...|$|E
