5|$|The Nine Stones, {{also known}} as the Devil's Nine Stones, the Nine Ladies, or Lady Williams and her Dog, is a stone circle located near to the village of Winterbourne Abbas in the {{south-western}} English county of Dorset. Archaeologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was likely erected during the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death. Liberty and others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{took so long}} to publish much of his work because of his controversial theory on the suicide of Custer's men. Historian Brian Dippie suggests that the Great Depression may also have been a contributing factor.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to have a}} successful performance review {{in order to get}} a raise. He makes elaborate posters, prepares a ridiculous speech, and pumps himself up in the office's hallway. Unfortunately for him, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) successfully prank him by making him <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a Friday instead of a Thursday. He arrives at the office very late the next day, much to Michael's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels {{built in the}} interim, so {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her {{marriage}} to King Henry VIII, Anne had befriended Sir Thomas Wyatt, {{who was one of}} the greatest poets of the Tudor reign. In 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Cobham, who by many accounts, was not a wife of his choosing. Thus, in 1525, Wyatt charged his wife with adultery and separated from her; coincidentally, historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was also the year where his interest in Anne intensified. In 1532, Wyatt accompanied the royal couple to Calais in France.|$|E

5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins at}} a funeral, {{attended}} by Guy, Caroline, Boyce (Oliver Chris), Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) and Sue White (Michelle Gomez). References {{made in the}} episode lead the viewer to first <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Mac's funeral, but then a giant picture of Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), who left the hospital in series two, appears. The cause of her death is not fully explained, although comments made by the characters indicate she died in a hunting accident with a moose. The plot then splits between three groups of characters.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system.

It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect the prestige of each territory, or they may represent an early example of book-keeping. Many historians {{are convinced that the}} Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E

5|$|In June 1841, {{with the}} help of {{influential}} supporters (among them was Domingo Róxas), Pule again {{sent a letter to the}} Real Audiencia requesting for the cofradía to be recognized. This letter was forwarded to the office of Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. The Governor-General himself personally reviewed the petition and was disturbed by the cofradías rule which excluded Spaniards and mestizos from joining without Pule's permission. This made De Oraá <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a seditious organization where religion was used as a blind for potential insurgence against Spanish authorities. De Oraá then recommended Pule's dismissal from San Juan de Dios Hospital and had the cofradía outlawed in July 1841, ordering its disbandment and the arrests of its members. Pule immediately went into hiding to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Norbert Wiener {{approached}} Bush with {{a proposal}} to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it {{on the grounds that}} he did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be completed {{before the end of the}} war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision.|$|E
5|$|Kingston Russell Stone Circle, {{also known}} as the Gorwell Circle, is a stone circle located between the villages of Abbotsbury and Littlebredy in the {{south-western}} English county of Dorset. Archaeologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Kingston Russell ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles.|$|E
