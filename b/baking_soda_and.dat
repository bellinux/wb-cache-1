5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E

Although NaHCO3 {{is itself}} an {{intermediate}} product of the Solvay process, the heating needed to remove the ammonia that contaminates it decomposes some NaHCO3, making it more economic to react finished Na2CO3 with CO2.|$|E

25|$|Chametz {{does not}} include baking soda, baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as {{leavening}} agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for tooth whitening. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> salt to make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E
500|$|The old-fashioned {{doughnut}} {{is a type}} of cake doughnut, and {{has been}} described as a [...] "subset" [...] of the cake doughnut. The cake doughnut itself originated in the United States circa 1829, when the increased availability of pearlash in the U.S., a type of leavener that preceded baking powder, lent to the increase of cake doughnut consumption. It is unclear when the old-fashioned doughnut itself was invented, but this very likely occurred after the cake doughnut was invented. Prior to circa 1829, doughnuts were typically the yeast-risen variety in the U.S. Circa the 1830s, the leaveners <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> baking powder began to be available to U.S. consumers, which is around the same time that cake doughnut recipes first appeared in U.S. cookbooks.|$|E

50|$|An early {{figure was}} Captain John Baptiste Ford, {{who used the}} salt to create soda ash, which in turn was used to create plate glass. In 1893, he created Michigan Alkali Company, which created <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> <b>soda</b> ash <b>and</b> lye. The company, later renamed Wyandotte Chemicals Co., went on to create a variety of soaps and cleaners, {{eventually}} becoming part of BASF and expanding into the BASF industrial complex.|$|R
2500|$|In Britain and Ireland, [...] {{fish and}} chip shops {{traditionally}} use a simple water and flour batter, adding a little sodium bicarbonate (<b>baking</b> <b>soda)</b> <b>and</b> a little vinegar to create lightness, as they react to create bubbles in the batter. Other recipes may use beer or milk batter, where these liquids are often substitutes for water. The {{carbon dioxide in}} the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter. Beer also results in an orange-brown colour. A simple beer batter might consist of a 2:3 ratio of flour to beer by volume. The type of beer makes the batter taste different: some prefer lager whereas others use stout or bitter.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the cradle}} cap is not severe, it could simply be combed out gently after bathing. The {{softened}} scales {{can then be}} brushed away with a soft brush, comb or cloth, but if not done very gently, this could worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. [...] Applying petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. [...] The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning. [...] Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (<b>baking</b> <b>soda)</b> <b>and</b> leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales. There have been no studies done on these treatments.|$|E
2500|$|For {{laboratory}} use, {{sodium acetate}} is inexpensive and usually purchased {{instead of being}} synthesized. It is sometimes produced in a laboratory experiment by the reaction of acetic acid, commonly in the 5–8% solution known as vinegar, with sodium carbonate ("washing soda"), sodium bicarbonate ("baking soda"), or sodium hydroxide ("lye", or [...] "caustic soda"). Any of these reactions produce sodium acetate and water. When a sodium and carbonate ion-containing compound is used as the reactant, the carbonate anion from sodium bicarbonate or carbonate, reacts with hydrogen from the carboxyl group (-COOH) in acetic acid, forming carbonic acid. Carbonic acid readily decomposes under normal conditions into gaseous carbon dioxide and water. This is the reaction {{taking place in the}} well-known [...] "volcano" [...] that occurs when the household products, <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> vinegar, are combined.|$|E

2500|$|Red wasp {{stingers}} do {{not remain}} in their victims. A red wasp sting is often painful and causes localized swelling and itchiness. In some cases, people report developing a full-body, itchy rash. Applying a cold compress or ice to the area can help relieve swelling, while application of calamine lotion or 1% hydrocortisone cream can help relieve itching and pain. [...] If neither of these creams is available, a paste made from <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> water is an effective sting remedy. The paste should be thick enough {{to stay on the}} area of the sting until it dries. Some individuals are known to have severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to wasp stings, so should seek immediate medical attention if severe symptoms begin to present. In very rare cases, children may develop shock after a red wasp sting.|$|E
2500|$|After exhuming {{the corpses}} from their graves, Moskvin {{researched}} mummification theories and technique from books {{in an attempt}} to preserve the bodies. He dried the corpses using a combination of salt and <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> <b>and</b> then cached the bodies in secure and dry places in and around cemeteries. Once the bodies were dried, he carried the bodies back to his home where he used various methods to make [...] "dolls" [...] of the corpses. Unable to prevent the bodies from withering and shrinking as they dried, he would wrap the limbs in strips of cloth to provide fullness, or he would stuff the bodies with rags and padding, sometimes adding wax masks decorated with nail polish over their faces before dressing them in brightly colored children's clothes and wigs. These details made the bodies appear to be large homemade dolls, which prevented their discovery. It was unclear if each dolls contained a full set of human remains. Moskvin claimed he made the dolls over the course of ten years. His parents, who were away for large portions of the year, were unaware of his activities.|$|E

50|$|The {{most popular}} {{version of the}} dish {{consists}} of finely grated, raw potato and mashed potato with flour, <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> buttermilk <b>and</b> sometimes egg.

The mixture is fried on a griddle pan for a few minutes on each side, similar to a normal pancake. Traditional alternatives include using only raw potatoes, boiling it as a dumpling or baking it as a loaf. The most noticeable difference between boxty and other fried potato dishes is its smooth, fine grained consistency.|$|R
