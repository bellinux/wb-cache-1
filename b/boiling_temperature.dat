25|$|However, {{the boiling}} point for aqueous {{ethylene}} glycol increases monotonically with increasing ethylene-glycol fraction. Thus, the use of ethylene glycol not only depresses the freezing point, but also elevates {{the boiling point}} such that the operating range for the heat-transfer fluid is broadened {{on both ends of}} the temperature scale. The increase in <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> is due to pure ethylene glycol having a much higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure than pure water; there is no chemical stabilization against boiling of the liquid phase at intermediate compositions, as there is against freezing.|$|E
25|$|A zone {{of rapid}} {{salinity}} increase with depth {{is called a}} halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around −1.9nbsp&°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, {{as is the case}} in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, {{as is the case in}} tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.|$|E
25|$|Compared to liquid water, {{microwave}} heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment). Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves {{due to the}} dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens. This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much {{in the manner of}} conventional , braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> of water.|$|E

The QSPR models developed with CODESSA allow accurate computation of the <b>boiling</b> <b>temperatures</b> of organic compounds using simple constitutional, topological, electrostatic and quantum indices that can be computed with standard quantum chemistry packages. For the group of 127 aldehydes and ketones, a good multiple linear regression equation was obtained using five theoretical descriptors, with the following statistical indices: r = 0. 990, r LOO = 0. 986, s = 5. 3 °C, and F = 1190. Equally good results were obtained for the group of 73 esters (r = 0. 993, r LOO = 0. 991, s = 4. 2 °C, and F = 906) and all 200 compounds (r = 0. 988, r LOO = 0. 987, s = 5. 6 °C, and F = 1628).

25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} shows a {{negative}} azeotrope of ideal constituents, X and Y. Again the bottom trace illustrates the <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> at various compositions, and again, below the bottom trace the mixture must be entirely liquid phase. The top trace again illustrates the condensation temperature of various compositions, and again, above the top trace the mixture must be entirely vapor phase. The point, A, shown here is a boiling point with a composition chosen very near to the azeotrope. The vapor is collected at the same temperature at point B. That vapor is cooled, condensed, and collected at point C. Because this example is a negative azeotrope rather than a positive one, the distillate is farther from the azeotrope than the original liquid mixture at point A was. So the distillate is poorer in constituent X and richer in constituent Y than the original mixture. Because this process has removed a greater fraction of Y from the liquid than it had originally, the residue must be poorer in Y and richer in X after distillation than before.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} azeotrope of constituents X and Y {{is shown}} in the adjacent diagram. Two at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the high-pressure system. The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point, B, which is {{on the same side of}} the azeotrope as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature.</b> If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure, it boils at point C. From C, by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point D, which is on the same side of the high-pressure azeotrope as C. If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure, it boils at point E, which is on the opposite side of the low-pressure azeotrope to A. So, by means of the pressure swing, it is possible to cross over the low-pressure azeotrope.|$|E
25|$|The various geyser basins {{are located}} where {{rainwater}} and snowmelt can percolate into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt {{at the surface}} as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are {{where most of the}} large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular fracture zone around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau's high elevation the average <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> at Yellowstone's geyser basins is 199°F (93°C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest geyser). Water erupting from Yellowstone's geysers is superheated above that boiling point to an average of 204°F (95.5°C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators.

25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} shows a {{positive}} azeotrope of hypothetical constituents, X and Y. The bottom trace illustrates the <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> of various compositions. Below the bottom trace, only the liquid phase is in equilibrium. The top trace illustrates the vapor composition above the liquid at a given temperature. Above the top trace, only the vapor is in equilibrium. Between the two traces, liquid and vapor phases exist simultaneously in equilibrium: for example, heating a 25% X : 75% Y mixture to temperature AB would generate vapor of composition B over liquid of composition A. The azeotrope is the point on the diagram where the two curves touch. The horizontal and vertical steps show the path of repeated distillations. Point A is the boiling point of a nonazeotropic mixture. The vapor that separates at that temperature has composition B. The shape of the curves requires that the vapor at B be richer in constituent X than the liquid at point A. The vapor is physically separated from the VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) system and is cooled to point C, where it condenses. The resulting liquid (point C) is now richer in X than it was at point A. If the collected liquid is boiled again, it progresses to point D, and so on. The stepwise progression shows how repeated distillation can never produce a distillate that is richer in constituent X than the azeotrope. Note that starting {{to the right of}} the azeotrope point results in the same stepwise process closing in on the azeotrope point from the other direction.|$|E

While the equation for the minimum film <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{which can be found}} in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective. One critical parameter to consider is the surface tension. The proportional relationship between the minimum film <b>boiling</b> <b>temperature</b> and surface tension is to be expected since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of nucleate boiling. Since film boiling occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for film boiling should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.|$|E
