40|$|Background: For the {{treatment}} of calcific tendinitis of the shoulder a variety of treatment regimes exist. Commonly used treatment measures include medication with oral analgesics, corticosteroid injections, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, ultrasound guided needling and lavage, and surgical treatment. Earlier cohort studies suggest that patients may benefit from these treatments, but there are few randomized studies and conflicting evidence {{about the effectiveness of}} the various treatments. In the present study we aim to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound guided needling and lavage (<b>barbotage)</b> together with a steroid injection to sham <b>barbotage</b> with and without an additional steroid injection. Methods: The study will be performed in six secondary-care institutions in Norway and Sweden. It is designed as a pragmatic, randomized, three-arm, parallel group, double-blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial with a 2 -year follow-up. It will be performed on 210 patients, aged 30 years or older, presenting with painful arc, positive impingement sign and a calcium deposit amp;gt; 5 mm. Randomization to one of the three treatment options will be performed by using an online central randomization system. The three treatment groups are <b>barbotage</b> together with a subacromial steroid injection (the <b>barbotage</b> group), sham <b>barbotage</b> together with a subacromial steroid injection (the steroid group) or sham <b>barbotage</b> without a subacromial steroid injection (the placebo group). In the placebo group the steroid injection will be replaced by a short-acting local anaesthetic. Standardized home-based post-treatment physiotherapy will be performed by all patients for 8 weeks. Follow-ups are at 2 and 6 weeks, 4, 8, 12 and 24 months after treatment was given and will be performed with the patients and the outcome assessors blinded for group assignment. Primary outcome will be the Oxford shoulder score at 4 month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures are the QuickDASH upper extremity score, the EQ- 5 D- 5 L general health score and visual analogue scales for pain at rest, during activity, and at night. Discussion: The scientific evidence from this placebo-controlled trial will be of importance for future treatment recommendations in patients with calcific tendinitis.

40|$|Bladder cancer, {{the fourth}} most common noncutaneous {{malignancy}} in the United States, is characterized by high recurrence rate, with a subset of these cancers progressing to a deadly muscle invasive form of disease. Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that contain proteins, mRNA and miRNA, thus potentially modulating signaling pathways in recipient cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell–cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. EMT has been implicated in the initiation of metastasis for cancer progression. We investigated the ability of bladder cancer-shed exosomes to induce EMT in urothelial cells. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from T 24 or UMUC 3 invasive bladder cancer cell conditioned media or from patient urine or bladder <b>barbotage</b> samples. Exosomes were then added to the urothelial cells and EMT was assessed. Urothelial cells treated with bladder cancer exosomes showed an increased expression in several mesenchymal markers, including α-smooth muscle actin, S 100 A 4 and snail, as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) -treated cells. Moreover, treatment of urothelial cells with bladder cancer exosomes resulted in decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin, {{as compared with the}} control, PBS-treated cells. Bladder cancer exosomes also increased the migration and invasion of urothelial cells, and this was blocked by heparin pretreatment. We further showed that exosomes isolated from patient urine and bladder <b>barbotage</b> samples were able to induce the expression of several mesenchymal markers in recipient urothelial cells. In conclusion, the research presented here represents both a new insight into the role of exosomes in transition of bladder cancer into invasive disease, as well as an introduction to a new platform for exosome research in urothelial cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Studying gas {{interaction}} process during the <b>barbotage</b> at the multi-component oxide melt {{with the purpose}} of testing the selective extraction possibility is of both scientific and practical interest. The solution of this problem within the scope of the complex solution of the rational raw material resources development problem is of especial interest for the Urals and for the Sverdlovsk region in particular. The processes mentioned above are the heterogeneous ones and go through the number of sequential stages. Each stage can be limiting one and influence the overall process. However despite of the mode of the reaction its speed depends on the chemical composition of the gas contained in the bubbles that rise in the melt. If the bubble resides in the melt for long enough time, the equilibrium is reached inside it, and the processes of gas interaction with melt stop.

Ninety-four urine samples from patients with TCC, patients with other urogenital diseases, and healthy donors were analyzed. Multiple protein changes were reproducibly detected in the TCC group, including five potential novel TCC biomarkers and seven protein clusters (mass range, 3. 3 to 133 kd). One of the TCC biomarkers (3. 4 kd) was also detected in bladder cancer cells procured from bladder <b>barbotage</b> and was identified as defensin.

40|$|Introduction/Aim: Chemotherapy or BCG given intravesically {{to prevent}} {{recurrence}} after transurethral resection (TUR) of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC) cause frequent, sometime severe, local toxicity. As a consequence, many patients do not complete the planned treatment (1). A major {{challenge for the}} urologists is to identify an early biomarker of urothelial damage to recognize and prevent local toxicity improving patient’s compliance. The purpose of our research {{was to investigate the}} relation between urothelial injury by intravesical treatment and the expression of potential biomarkers in urine and/or in <b>barbotage</b> solution. The urinary HB-EGF expression in interstitial cystitis has been analyzed by a few studies (2, 3). As a preliminary step, the variations of Fibronectin (FN), Epidermal Growth Factor- Receptor (EGF-R) and Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor (HB-EGF) during intravesical therapy and after the administration of a solution with the potential role of urothelial repairing (hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate) were investigated. Patients and Methods: the toxicity of intravesical therapy with mitomycin, epirubicin or BCG was classified in 3 grades (absent, moderate, severe). Urine and bladder washing solution during intravesical therapy in 55 patients after NMI-BC TUR and in 10 healthy controls for a total of 200 samples were collected. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cell pellet using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen®). FN and EGF-R gene expression by Real Time quantitative PCR were analyzed. The expression of HB-EGF was measured in urine samples by ELISA (Abcam®). Results: In <b>barbotage</b> samples the FN gene expression and the EGF-R levels in our patients were respectively increased a median of 4. 7 fold and decreased of 0. 9 fold compared to controls. Before intravesical therapy and in absence of local toxicity, gene expression increased 1. 9 fold for FN and 1. 1 fold for EGF-R. In contrast, in patients with local toxicity due to intravesical therapy, the FN gene expression levels increased to a median of 5. 82 fold, while EGF-R remained unchanged. The administration of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution decreased the mean FN gene expression from 3 to 0. 6 fold, with concomitant symptomatic relief. HB-EGF protein median urine levels were 25. 7 pg/ml in 13 patients before intravesical therapy and 18. 9 pg/ml in 5 healthy controls. No significant variations in relation to the local toxicity. During therapy median HB-EGF protein levels in urine varied from 21. 6 pg/ml in absence of toxicity to 25. 7 pg/ml in case of severe toxicity to 18. 5 pg/ml after hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution. Preliminarily, the observed variations of HB-EGF, increasing no more than 1. 2 fold compared to healthy controls, do not seem possible marker of urothelial damage. Discussion and Conclusion: EGF-R gene and HBEGF expressions do not seem to vary significantly in relation to local toxicity due to intravesical therapy. FN gene is overexpressed in presence of urothelial damage significantly reduced by intravesical hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate solution administration, according with symptoms relief...|$|E

40|$|Treatment of "subacromial {{impingement}} syndrome" of {{the shoulder}} has changed drastically in the past decade. The anatomical explanation as "impingement" of the rotator cuff {{is not sufficient to}} cover the pathology. "Subacromial pain syndrome", SAPS, describes the condition better. A working group formed from a number of Dutch specialist societies, joined by the Dutch Orthopedic Association, has produced a guideline based on the available scientific evidence.

The important conclusions and advice from this work are as follows: (1) The diagnosis SAPS can only be made using a combination of clinical tests. (2) SAPS should preferably be treated non-operatively. (3) Acute pain should be treated with analgetics if necessary. (4) Subacromial injection with corticosteroids is indicated for persistent or recurrent symptoms. (5) Diagnostic imaging is useful after 6 weeks of symptoms. Ultrasound examination is the recommended imaging, to exclude a rotator cuff rupture. (6) Occupational interventions are useful when complaints persist for longer than 6 weeks. (7) Exercise therapy should be specific and should be of low intensity and high frequency, combining eccentric training, attention to relaxation and posture, and treatment of myofascial trigger points (including stretching of the muscles) may be considered. (8) Strict immobilization and mobilization techniques are not recommended. (9) Tendinosis calcarea can be treated by shockwave (ESWT) or needling under ultrasound guidance (<b>barbotage).</b> (10) Rehabilitation in a specialized unit can be considered in chronic, treatment resistant SAPS, with pain perpetuating behavior.

Cytology, immunocytology and DNA‐image‐cytometry were performed in spontaneously voided urine samples and <b>barbotage</b> bladder washings from 71 patients. The DNA content was determined using the CM‐ 1 Cytometer according to the recommendation of the ESCAP Consensus Report on Standardization of DNA‐image‐cytometry (1995). For immunocytological examination we used the monoclonal anti Lewis X antibody P‐ 12 and antibody 486 p 3 / 12. All patients underwent subsequent cystoscopy and for any suspicious lesion biopsy or transurethral resection was done. Histological findings revealed 31 patients with transitional cell carcinomas of different stages and grades of malignancy. 40 patients had various benign diseases of the urinary bladder. Cytology yielded a sensitivity of 68 % and a specificity of 100 %. DNA aneuploidy was detected in 81 % of cancer patients with a specificity of 100 %. By combination of these two methods the overall sensitivity increased to 87 %. Immunocytology with Lewis X and 486 p 3 / 12 antibodies showed reactivity in 84 % and 87 % in combination with a specificity of 80 % and 70 %, respectively. By combining urinary cytology, immunocytology and/or DNA‐image‐cytometry the overall sensitivity increased to 94 % with no change in specificity. DNA‐image‐cytometry should be used to evaluate particularly urothelial cells suspicious for malignancy in urinary specimens. Because of low specificity the monoclonal antibodies against Lewis X‐ and 486 p 3 / 12 antigens are not helpful in screening for bladder cancer. Nevertheless, their high sensitivity may justify their use in case DNA image cytometry is not available and in the follow up of patients with transitional cell carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Arylamine N-acetyltransferases are {{xenobiotic}} metabolising enzymes, {{involved in}} metabolic pathways leading to either detoxification or bio-activation {{of drugs and}} carcinogens. In humans, polymorphisms of the two functional NAT genes (NAT 1 and NAT 2 } have been implicated to cancer susceptibility. The genomic region of the NAT 1 loci, 8 p 22, is often deleted in tumours and is believed to contain tumour suppressor genes. Two previously developed cosmid probes, carrying either NAT 1 or NAT 2, were tested as probes for FISH analysis using nuclei from healthy lymphocytes and the RT 112 urothelial carcinoma cell line (Chapter 3). FISH analysis of cells obtained from <b>barbotage</b> samples of bladder cancer patients was performed and deletion of the NAT genomic region was a common observation (Chapter 6). To allow refined mapping of the NAT region on 8 p 22, a series of PAC clones carrying the NAT loci were isolated by PCR screening of a genomic library (Chapter 3). Furthermore, the NAT 1 and NAT 2 isoenzymes were studied in healthy intestinal and mammary tissue, {{as a first step}} towards understanding their potential involvement in these two types of cancer (Chapter 6). The mouse has been extensively used as a model for studying NAT. Three functional Nat genes are present in the mouse genome. A fine restriction map was generated for the Nat 1 and Nat 2 genomic region in mice, using Nat -positive genomic DNA plasmid clones previously isolated from the fast acetylator Balb/c and 129 /Ola strains. The Nat 1 and Nat 2 genes were mapped 9. 4 kb apart and no polymorphisms were detected between the two strains for the restriction enzymes used for mapping (Chapter 4). The 129 /Ola restriction map has since been the basis for the production of a construct for Nat 2 knockout and transgenic mouse strains. PAC clones positive for Nat were isolated from a mouse genomic library and used as FISH probes to map the three murine Nat genes on chromosome 8, band B 3. 1 - 3. 3. One PAC clone contained all three Nat loci, establishing co-localisation of Nat 3 with the other two Nat genes in mice. The minimum distance of Nat 3 from Nat 1 and Nat 2 was estimated to be 22 kb, while the three loci are within 130 kb. YAC clones carrying the Nat genes were also isolated to facilitate physical mapping of the Nat cluster in mice (Chapter 5). This will allow integration of cytogenetic, physical and previous genetic data for comparative studies. </p...|$|E
