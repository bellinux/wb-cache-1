50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> {{because there is}} no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, cut wire, grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted {{as well as on the}} expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.|$|E

40|$|All {{activities}} {{of an organization}} involve risks that should be managed. The risk management process aids decision making by taking account of uncertainty {{and the possibility of}} future events or circumstances (intended or unintended) and their effects on agreed objectives. With that idea, new ISO Standard has been drawn up. ISO 31010 has been recently issued which provides a structured process that identifies how objectives may be affected, and analyses the risk in term of consequences and their probabilities before deciding on whether further treatment is required. In this lecture, that ISO Standard has been adapted to Open Pit <b>Blasting</b> <b>Operations,</b> focusing in Environmental effects which can be managed properly. Technique used is Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), which is applied in all possible scenarios, providing to Blasting Professionals the tools to identify, analyze and manage environmental effects in <b>blasting</b> <b>operations.</b> Also this lecture can help to minimize each effect, studying each case. This paper also can be useful to Project Managers and Occupational Health and Safety Departments (OH&S) because <b>blasting</b> <b>operations</b> can be evaluated and compared one to each other to determine the risks that should be managed in different case studies. The environmental effects studied are: ground vibrations, flyrock and air overpressure (airblast).

5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation.</b> To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>operations</b> in the {{vicinity}} of residential areas usually produce significant environmental problems which may cause severe damage to the nearby areas. Blast-induced air overpressure (AOp) {{is one of the most}} important environmental impacts of <b>blast</b> <b>operations</b> which needs to be predicted to minimize the potential risk of damage. This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) optimized by the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) for the prediction of AOp induced by quarry blasting. For this purpose, 95 <b>blasting</b> <b>operations</b> were precisely monitored in a granite quarry site in Malaysia and AOp values were recorded in each operation. Furthermore, the most influential parameters on AOp, including the maximum charge per delay and the distance between the blast-face and monitoring point, were measured and used to train the ICA-ANN model. Based on the generalized predictor equation and considering the measured data from the granite quarry site, a new empirical equation was developed to predict AOp. For comparison purposes, conventional ANN models were developed and compared with the ICA-ANN results. The results demonstrated that the proposed ICA-ANN model is able to predict blast-induced AOp more accurately than other presented techniques...|$|R

40|$|Road {{aggregate}} is {{the largest}} component contributing to road construction. In Sri Lanka, naturally occurring sources that suits construction work are not available. Therefore, this requirement is most commonly fulfilled by excavating rocks and crushing them to suitable sizes. Demand for road aggregate has increased due to the current development of highway sector in Sri Lanka, {{and it is difficult}} to satisfy the requirement. In some areas of the country, especially in the Northern region, it is hard to fulfill these requirements due to several reasons such as archeological sites and environmental-sensitive forest areas. Therefore, quality control and fulfillment of the requirement with the available limited sources is a challenge. Considering the use of crushed rock for road construction, it is important to select materials in an acceptable quality. Especially when crushed rock is used for the road bases and surfacing, these properties play a vital role in ensuring durability. To ensure the quality, various tests have been introduced by relevant authorities. When selecting a source to produce crushed rock as road construction material, production from the selected source have to satisfy certain requirements. The los angeles abration value (LAAV) and aggregate impact value (AIV) is the two important tests which ensure the strength requirement of road aggregate. With the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation,</b> a considerable variation of rock fragmentation is noted. This is mainly due to the explosive quantity used for <b>blasting</b> <b>operation.</b> Types and features of explosives and blasting design also play an important role of rock mass fragmentation. In Sri Lanka, blasting design patterns and the explosives used do not vary considerably. But usage of explosives changes in continuous operation even the place is unchanged. These changes may be due to environmental conditions such as rainy seasons or due to some significant change of nature and properties of rock mass. The objective of this study was to identify the changes of AIV and LAAV with the use of explosive percentage used for the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> and improve the strength of road aggregate by controlling the explosive usage for aggregate production. There was not found a relationship between explosive usage for blasting and the aggregate strength properties. But the significant relationship was found between the LAAV and AIV of the aggregate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn <b>blasting</b> <b>operation,</b> {{the aim is}} {{to achieve}} proper {{fragmentation}} and to avoid undesirable events such as backbreak. Therefore, predicting rock fragmentation and backbreak is very important to arrive at a technically and economically successful outcome. Since many parameters affect the blasting results in a complicated mechanism, employment of robust methods such as artificial neural network may be very useful. In this regard, this paper attends to simultaneous prediction of rock fragmentation and backbreak in the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> of Tehran Cement Company limestone mines in Iran. Back propagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are adopted for the simulation. Also, regression analysis is performed between independent and dependent variables. For the BPNN modeling, a network with architecture 6 - 10 - 2 is found to be optimum whereas for the RBFNN, architecture 6 - 36 - 2 with spread factor of 0. 79 provides maximum prediction aptitude. Performance comparison of the developed models is fulfilled using value account for (VAF), root mean square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R 2) and maximum relative error (MRE). As such, it is observed that the BPNN model is the most preferable model providing maximum accuracy and minimum error. Also, sensitivity analysis shows that inputs burden and stemming are the most effective parameters on the outputs fragmentation and backbreak, respectively. On the other hand, for both of the outputs, specific charge is the least effective parameter...|$|E
30|$|The {{impact of}} {{blasting}} on {{crushing and grinding}} was also investigated in mining literature (Workman and Eloranta 2003). Drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> determined the particle size of the crusher feed. Since more energy required to break coarser feed size (Pothina et al. 2007), smaller fragmentation size can provide substantial cost savings for the crushing process by reducing the energy consumption. However, decreasing particle size causes {{an increase in the}} production as more material is loaded and hauled in a cycle. In this case, the production capacity of crusher may be exceeded which leads to a queue at the crusher and the opportunity costs for the hauling and loading equipment.|$|E
40|$|In {{the open}} cast mining {{drilling}} and <b>blasting</b> <b>operations</b> are required for extraction of ore or coal and simultaneously it helps in loosening the strata. Drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>operations</b> {{are associated with a}} numerous number of problems such as formation of dust, evolution of harmful gases, ground vibrations, crack development and production of noise. As a result these operations are not considered as eco-friendly. So we are in a search of blast free mining method. Also these operations are too costly as a lot of machinery and labour cost is associated with it. Blast free mining is the demand of the era to conserve the environment. As s a result from various kinds of studies and research it has been found that Ripper dozer could be a possible solution. Ripper dominantly put in use for the extraction of overburden. It not only reduces the number of machinery but also produces a better solution for the problems posed by drilling and <b>blasting</b> <b>operations.</b> As a result we have to be conscious for installing any ripper and dozer so proper rippability measurement of the strata with the present machine to be installed must be done properly. There are various constraints on which rippability of rocks depend on. Relationships are studied between the constraints and production of rippers. Taking in account of all these constraints rippers are employed into the mines...|$|R
