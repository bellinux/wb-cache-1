40|$|In cancer oncology, {{using of}} Mega {{electron}} Volt (MeV) bremsstrahlung photons has been clinically practised on cancer patients since photons can deliver a significant dose to tumour volumes when projected {{into the body}} in several beam directions as in techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radio Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). However, photons in a single beam deposit their maximum energy just a few millimetres at the beam's <b>body</b> <b>entrance</b> and a decreasing dose deposition beyond the tumour site. Cancer research and clinical practice have resorted to use of charged particles like protons and carbon ion beams for cancer therapy since they deposit a large fraction of their energy at their extreme range in a Bragg peak with very less dose deposition after the Bragg peak targeted to the tumour. This ensures maximum dose to tumour for therapy and spares organs at risk in both forward and behind the clinical target volume. The intention {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the feasibility of prompt gamma imaging for the on- line verification of the Bragg peak position. In order to achieve this aim, interactions of 160 MeV proton and 300 MeV/u carbon ion pencil beams within a soft tissue phantom were simulated. Monte Carlo simulations based on FLUKA, have been performed to analyse prompt gamma radiation produced as a result of inelastic nuclear interactions during both proton and carbon ion therapy procedures. These simulations were performed with a main view of designing a prompt gamma imaging device utilizing Compton scatter events and photoelectric effect processes of gamma radiation for real time control of incident beam during hadron therapy. Such a gamma detector system is called a Compton camera which has potential to utilize high energy photons emitted out of patients during hadron therapy which has long been a constraint in Anger cameras as they are only capable to image low energy photons of about 140 keV in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). In this project, two chief objectives were to be achieved and these were: first, to present the physical and interaction characteristics of both primary beam and secondary radiation like protons, neutrons and more so prompt gammas by their angular distribution after their production and photon energy spectrum as a result of de-excitation of the different atomic nuclei of human soft tissue. The fine energy loss and inelastic nuclear interactions with tissue nuclei for both 160 MeV proton beam and 300 MeV/u carbon ion beams as they traverse through human soft tissue have also been included in these studies. The second objective which was divided into two sub-tasks was; to simulate the imaging performance of first, a High Purity Germanium (HPGE) Compton Camera and second, a single scattering Compton camera made up of a sub-detector system of silicon to act as a photon scattering detector and a germanium absorber detector. Primary beam range and photon source distribution were investigated using an iterative algorithm for reconstruction of cones using Compton scatter angle and energy deposition at Compton scattering and photoelectric effect positions in each Compton camera since reconstructed cones carried position and directional information of emitted prompt gamma radiation. Results from the first task of this project showed that prompt gammas from soft tissue nuclei de-excitation were emitted isotropically in all directions for both proton and carbon ion simulations of 1 x 10 ^ 7 primaries with distinct peaks at 2. 3 MeV, 3. 6 MeV, 4. 4 MeV, 5. 3 MeV and 6. 2 MeV which corresponded to 14 ^N, 20 ^Ca, 12 ^C, 14 ^N and 16 ^O atomic nuclei de-excitation photon energies respectively. For a HPGE Compton camera of dimensions 32 cmx 8 cmx 32 cm placed 8 cm to the top of the soft tissue phantom at orthogonal angle to the incident primary beam, data acquisition was done using gammas first Compton scattered within the detector and secondary photo-absorbed in the same germanium crystal. Only two successive interaction events were considered with a major assumption that the scattered quantum photon was completely absorbed at its second and last interaction in the germanium crystal. The number of secondary radiation that reached the detector included neutrons, electrons, positrons, protons and photons. Photons were Compton scattered in the angular range from 0 to 180 with low energetic photons scattered in angles greater than 90. The energy spectrum of photons before Compton scattering showed an energy range from 0. 1 MeV to 1. 6 MeV with a sharp peak at 0. 2 MeV in the 160 MeV proton beam simulation. This peak was shifted to 0. 18 MeV in the 300 MeV/u carbon ion simulation and both simulations exhibited a 0. 511 MeV photon peak. The angular resolution of the detector measured by angular resolution measure showed that ARM values of less than 3 mm would give better photon source predictions with a clear distinct primary beam range at 16 cm depth into human soft tissue using the germanium block Compton camera while as when using the single scattering Compton camera, the ARM values less than 6 mm accurately predicted the prompt gamma production distribution in the soft tissue phantom. Comparing the HPGe Compton camera with single scattering Compton camera in terms of photon energy range optimization for Compton cone reconstruction, the single scattering Compton camera proved to be better than the HPGe detector since it utilized photons from 0. 03 MeV to 3 MeV for Compton cone reconstruction and yet the HPGe Compton camera only used a short energy from 0. 1 MeV to 1. 6 MeV. But single scattering Compton camera reconstruction results were affected by Doppler broadening as photons of energies less than 0. 1 MeV were inclusive in the energy spectrum. The single scattering Compton camera was further found to have a better overall efficiency of 0. 07 % over that of HPGe Compton camera which was 0. 032 %. For both Compton cameras, the reconstruction source distribution tracked the original photon production distribution at the distal fall off by a precision of 0. 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|ReviewInternational audienceIn {{the past}} year, the {{influence}} of psychosocial and environmental stressors in different pathogenesis received increased awareness. The brain is the master manager of the interpretation of what is stressful and of the physiological responses that are produced. Animals have developed conserved strategies to respond to stressful conditions, in particular, the secretion of stress-specific neuromediators which mediate protective and adaptative effects {{in the short run}} and yet can accelerate pathophysiology when they are over-produced or mis-managed. The Cortico-Releasing Factor (CRF) and their derived peptides are the majors stress neuromediators. Their localization has originally been described in the central nervous system where they play a pivotal role to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and was recently extended to the periphery. While the peripheral effects of CRF signalling need to be more thoroughly investigated, it has been described to influence disease negatively, in particular in the intestine. The epithelial barrier is a crucial checkpoint to control <b>body</b> <b>entrances.</b> Prolonged exposure to stress can cause ultrastructural epithelial abnormalities and can increase barrier permeability, which favors luminal translocation, immune activation and thus induces inflammation. This review summarizes the present knowledge on the stress response and the effects of both acute and chronic stress to induce pathological damage to the intestine. We present the potential pathways involved, and the proposed mechanisms of action, mediating these effects. The CRF system is potentially useful as a diagnostic marker or a therapy target for inflammatory diseases and cancer...|$|R

40|$|Bats of {{temperate}} zones which hibernate {{during winter}} become cold-lethargic during their diurnal rest time even in summer. At {{the end of}} their nocturnal activity period they show a drop in body temperature close to ambient temperature (M. myotis, cf. Pohl, 1961). This takes place periodically even if the bats are kept in constant darkness (Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis lucifugus, cf. Menaker, 1959, 1961). The daily drop in body temperature is not simply the result of one single reduction in heat production, but seems to be a more complicated process since EKG-records during entrance into cold lethargy (Kulzer, 1967) showed increases and decreases in heart frequency which can be related to a regulatory activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Normothermy, with body temperatures at about 37 °C, and even lethargy, with body temperatures close to ambient temperature, are both levels with more or less precisely regulated <b>body</b> temperature. <b>Entrance</b> into cold-lethargy may be the process during which the thermoregulatory level is changing from normothermy to lethargy, and the EKGvariations may be related to this change in thermoregulation. In order to obtain more data on thermoregulation during entrance into cold-lethargy, O 2 -consumption, CO 2 -production, and two different body temperatures were measured in Myotis myotis.

50|$|On 27 October 1480 a {{group of}} Florentine {{painters}} left for Rome, {{where he had been}} called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV.

40|$|The {{stability}} of {{temperature and humidity}} in caves is well known. However, little is known if higher or lower cave environmental stability (temperature, humidity, light and others) implies changes {{in the structure of}} the biological communities. Number, position and size of entrances, then size, depth, host rock and extent of the cave, the amount and type of food resources are all factors that can have strong influence on the cave biological communities. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between the presence of water <b>bodies,</b> size of <b>entrances</b> and the linear development of caves with the terrestrial invertebrate richness and species composition in 55 limestone caves located in the Brazilian Savannah, sampled from 2000 to 2011. Invertebrates were sampled by active search throughout the caves, prioritizing micro-habitats (sites under rocks) and organic resources (litter, twigs, feces and bat guano). We recorded 1, 451 invertebrate species. Species richness was positively correlated with presence of cave streams, width of entrances and linear development of the caves. The richness of troglomorphic species was positively correlated to the presence of perennial pools and linear development of the caves. The presence of cave streams was a decisive factor for determining the community structure, increasing the number and the similarity of troglophile species among the caves. Flood pulses can cause disturbances that eventually select the same species besides importing resources.

60|$|A little scream from Mrs. Budd, {{which was}} dutifully {{taken up by}} the maid, {{interrupted}} the speech of the latter, and every eye was turned on Mulford, as if to ask an explanation of the groaning sound that had been heard within the wreck. The young mate comprehended only too well. The rolling of the wreck had lifted a portion of the open hatchway above the undulating surface of the sea, and a large quantity of the pent air within the hold had escaped in a <b>body.</b> The <b>entrance</b> of water to supply the vacuum had produced the groan. Mulford had made new marks on the vessel's bottom with his knife, and he stepped down to them, anxious and nearly heart-broken, to note the effect. That one surging of the wreck had permitted air enough to escape to lower it in the water several inches. As yet, however, the visible limits of their floating foundation had not been sufficiently reduced {{to attract the attention of}} the females; and the young man said nothing on the subject. He thought that Jack Tier was sensible of the existence of this new source of danger, but if he were, that experienced mariner imitated his own reserve, and made no allusion to it. Thus passed the day. Occasionally the wreck rolled heavily, when more air escaped, the hull settling lower and lower in the water as a necessary consequence. The little bubbles continued incessantly to rise, and Mulford became satisfied that another day must decide their fate. Taking this view of their situation, he saw no use in reserving their food, but encouraged his companions to share the whole of what remained at sunset. Little persuasion was necessary, and when night once more came to envelope them in darkness, not a mouthful of food or a drop of water remained to meet the necessities of the coming morn. It had rained again for a short time, in the course of the afternoon, when enough water had been caught to allay their thirst, and what was almost of as much importance to the females now, a sufficiency of sun had succeeded to dry their clothes, thus enabling them to sleep without enduring the chilling damps that might otherwise have prevented it. The wind had sensibly fallen, and the ground-swell was altogether gone, but Mulford was certain that the relief had come too late. So much air had escaped while it lasted as scarce to leave him the hope that the wreck could float until morning. The rising of the bubbles was now incessant, the crevices by which they escaped having most probably opened a little, in consequence of the pressure and the unceasing action of the currents, small as the latter were.|$|R
60|$|The idea of SOLIDITY {{we receive}} by our touch: and it {{arises from the}} {{resistance}} which we find in <b>body</b> to the <b>entrance</b> of any other body into the place it possesses, till it has left it. There is no idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether we move or rest, in what posture soever we are, we always feel something under us that supports us, and hinders our further sinking downwards; and the bodies which we daily handle make us perceive that, whilst they remain between them, they do, by an insurmountable force, hinder {{the approach of the}} parts of our hands that press them. THAT WHICH THUS HINDERS THE APPROACH OF TWO BODIES, WHEN THEY ARE MOVED ONE TOWARDS ANOTHER, I CALL SOLIDITY. I will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid be nearer to its original signification than that which mathematicians use it in. It suffices that I think the common notion of solidity will allow, if not justify, this use of it; but if any one think it better to call it IMPENETRABILITY, he has my consent. Only I have thought the term solidity the more proper to express this idea, not only because of its vulgar use in that sense, but also because it carries something more of positive in it than impenetrability; which is negative, and is perhaps more a consequence of solidity, than solidity itself. This, of all other, seems the idea most intimately connected with, and essential to body; so as nowhere else to be found or imagined, but only in matter. And though our senses take no notice of it, but in masses of matter, of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in us: yet the mind, having once got this idea from such grosser sensible bodies, traces it further, and considers it, as well as figure, in the minutest particle of matter that can exist; and finds it inseparably inherent in body, wherever or however modified.|$|R
40|$|We use path {{integral}} simulations {{to investigate}} the separation of H- 2 and HD, as well as H- 2 and D- 2, in carbon slit pores of various sizes using a new improved set of carbon-hydrogen interaction parameters determined in our laboratory. As expected, the selectivity of HD over H- 2 is {{lower than that of}} D- 2 over H- 2 at the same conditions due to the smaller mass of HD molecules and hence larger quantum effects, In the pressure range of 0. 1 - 10. 0 bar, the selectivity is not sensitive to the pressure at the temperature of 77 K. At 40 K the selectivity shows a positive relation to the adsorbed phase density. We also report all unusual crossover effect in which the selectivity in a pore of width 0. 85 nm exceeds that in a smaller pore (0. 69 nm) at high densities due to enhanced quantum confinement effects when a second layer forms in the larger pore. The optimal pore widths for HD/H- 2 separations were identified to be 0. 56 - 0. 57 nm, with operating pressures of 10. 0 and 0. 1 bar for the two pore sizes, respectively. We also simulate equilibrium separation in the commercial Takeda 3 angstrom carbon molecular sieve, based on a slit-like pore model with a distribution of pore sizes, but find only modest equilibrium selectivity for HD over H- 2). It is suggested that while quantum effects are small within the pore <b>bodies,</b> narrow pore <b>entrances</b> must lead to significant quantum effects on the dynamics in order to explain literature data of faster uptake of D- 2 compared to H- 2 at 77 K in this material. Thus, kinetic molecular sieving at narrow necks. for which this material is well established, maybe a more attractive option than equilibrium separation. Alternatively, materials with controlled smaller pore sizes ire needed for more efficient equilibrium HD/H- 2) separation.
