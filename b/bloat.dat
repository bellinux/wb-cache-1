25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus, {{also known}} as <b>bloat,</b> affects Airedale Terriers. The stomach can twist and block the esophagus, causing a buildup of gas and leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Signs of <b>bloat</b> include gastric distress (stomach pain), futile attempts at vomiting, and increased salivation. <b>Bloat</b> usually occurs when the dog is exercised too soon after eating. They will eat up to 4-6 cups of food at a time.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} very deep-chested breeds, gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (also known as <b>bloat)</b> {{is the most}} common serious health problem in the borzoi. This life-threatening condition is believed to be anatomical rather than strictly genetic in origin. One common recommendation in the past has been to raise the food bowl of the dog when it eats. However, studies have shown that this may actually increase the risk of <b>bloat.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abdominal <b>bloating</b> is {{commonly}} reported {{by men and}} women of all ages. <b>Bloating</b> occurs in nearly all patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and it also occurs in patients with other functional and organic disorders. <b>Bloating</b> is frequently disturbing to patients and frustrating to clinicians, as effective treatments are limited and are not universally successful. Although the terms <b>bloating</b> and abdominal distention are often used interchangeably, these symptoms likely involve different pathophysiologic processes, both of which are still not completely understood.

30|$|Some {{suggestions}} and recommendations {{were made by}} patients that require some reflection and discussion. First, <b>bloating</b> was endorsed by 11 (44 %) patients as a relevant symptom of gastroparesis, four of which (16 %) suggested adding this symptom to the diary. It {{should be noted that}} <b>bloating</b> was part of the original GCSI measure but was subsequently removed following FDA recommendations and previous research that indicated overlap in postprandial fullness and <b>bloating</b> concepts by gastroparesis patients [30]. Furthermore, the current study showed that less than half of patients endorsed <b>bloating.</b> Future clinical studies may include the <b>bloating</b> item as an exploratory symptom for gastroparesis.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>bloating</b> is a fastidious symptom {{reported}} by many patients {{who also have}} other gastrointestinal functional disorders. <b>Bloating</b> {{is more common in}} women, and it is often associated with meals and improves or disappears overnight. No specific treatments are to date available for this disturbing symptom. Aims: to evaluate the effects of an oral enterovaccine (Colifagina®) on <b>bloating</b> and other abdominal symptoms in patients with prevalent complaints of functional <b>bloating.</b> Patients and methods: one hundred and forty-eight patients with functional <b>bloating</b> according to Rome III criteria were recruited. Questionnaires and a VAS scale on their symptoms were administered at baseline and after four weeks of therapy with Colifagina®. Results: after treatment, a significant amelioration of <b>bloating</b> (p < 0. 0001), abdominal pain (p < 0. 0001) and flatus (p < 0. 0001) was observed; nausea and vomiting scores were not significantly different {{at the end of the}} treatment.

40|$|Abdominal <b>bloating</b> is a {{very common}} and {{troublesome}} symptom of all ages, {{but it has not}} been fully understood to date. <b>Bloating</b> is usually associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders or organic diseases, but it may also appear alone. The pathophysiology of <b>bloating</b> remains ambiguous, although some evidences support the potential mechanisms, including gut hypersensitivity, impaired gas handling, altered gut microbiota, and abnormal abdominal-phrenic reflexes. Owing to the in-sufficient understanding of these mechanisms, the available therapeutic options are limited. However, medical treatment with some prokinetics, rifaximin, lubiprostone and linaclotide could be considered in the treatment of <b>bloating.</b> In addition, dietary intervention is important in relieving symptom in patients with <b>bloating.</b> (J Neurogastroenterol Motil 2013; 19 : 433 - 453...|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to other}} {{purebred}} dogs, Bloodhounds suffer {{an unusually high}} rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with gastric dilatation volvulus (<b>bloat)</b> being {{the most common type}} of gastrointestinal problem. The breed also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments; thus these areas should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of <b>bloat,</b> which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat quickly.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{diseases}} {{can affect}} the Leonberger—certain types of cancers are very common in the breed. Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called <b>bloat,</b> is another serious condition that affects many of the large and giant breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests. It causes the stomach to twist and can be fatal quite quickly. Adult Leonbergers should always be fed twice a day rather than one large meal {{in order to reduce}} the likelihood of <b>bloat.</b> Leonbergers are not alone in inheriting serious diseases and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus in dogs {{is likely}} {{caused by a}} multitude of factors, but in all cases the immediate prerequisite is a dysfunction of the sphincter between the esophagus and stomach and an obstruction of outflow through the pylorus. Some of the more widely acknowledged factors for developing GDV include increased age, breed, having a deep and narrow chest, eating foods such as kibble that expand in the stomach, overfeeding, too much water consumption in a small period of time before or after exercise and other causes of gastrointestinal disease and distress. Studies have indicated {{that the risk of}} <b>bloat</b> in dogs perceived as happy by their owners is decreased, and increased in dogs perceived as fearful. This {{may be due to the}} physiological effects of the dog's personality on the function and motility of the gastrointestinal system. Alternatively, the dogs may become unhappy/uncomfortable as a consequence of the conditions that lead up to exhibiting <b>bloat.</b> Dogs with inflammatory bowel disease may be at an increased risk for <b>bloat.</b>|$|E

25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (<b>bloat)</b> is {{a common}} condition in dogs in which the stomach fills with gas, and can become torsed. This requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent necrosis of the stomach wall and death of the dog. During surgery, the stomach is deflated and put back into its normal position. A gastropexy may be performed, whereby the stomach {{is attached to the}} body wall to prevent this condition from recurring. A splenectomy or partial gastrectomy may also be required.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) in this breed, which occurs when twisting of the stomach (volvulus or torsion) causes or is caused by excess gas. Symptoms include restlessness, inability to get comfortable, pacing, or retching without being able to bring up anything. The dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen, but <b>bloat</b> or torsion can occur without visible swelling. A dog with GDV requires immediate veterinary care. The dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get to a veterinarian in time.|$|E
40|$|Background: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a common}} gastrointestinal disorder. Recent studies suggest the importance of gut flora in the pathophysiology of it. Therefore, antibiotics have demonstrated a substantial benefit to reduce gut flora. Having few side effects, and applying one-dose per day, we studied the effect of azithromycin to treat IBS. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty-six patients enrolled a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The treatment group received azithromycin in addition to common treatment. Patients were followed for 12 weeks. Patients completed daily diaries documenting their symptoms. Results: One hundred and thirteen patients completed the study. The onset of relief occurred significantly sooner, and duration of relief was significantly longer in azithromycin group. Movement, abdominal pain, <b>bloating,</b> and gas were significantly better in azithromycin group. Monthly results showed superior relief in <b>bloating,</b> gas, overall symptom, and overall <b>bloating</b> during 3 months. Significantly more patients in azithromycin group felt relief in <b>bloating</b> and gas and had greater consistency relief in almost all weeks. Conclusion: In our study, azithromycin significantly relieved most symptoms, such as abdominal pain, <b>bloating,</b> and gas. Overall symptom and overall <b>bloating</b> were relieved significantly in more patients in the intervention group in all weeks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{determining}} {{the criteria for}} defect formation {{during the early stages}} of thermal binder removal within an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) polymer filled with submicron SiC ceramic powder. The only product of the early stage thermal degradation reaction of EVA within an inert atmosphere is acetic acid. This single component and well characterized organic reaction product has allowed the defect forming criteria to be definitively examined. It will be shown that <b>bloating</b> occurs {{in the early stages of}} binder removal as a result of pressure build-up in the specimen resulting from acetic acid formed from the thermal elimination reaction of EVA. The first part of this paper examines defect formation occurring in the pure polymer within a hot-stage optical microscope. Bubble formation is observed in the pure polymer. Next, <b>bloating</b> occurring in the molded system is examined. The affect of mineral oil on <b>bloating</b> is also discussed as well as the effect that molding pressure has on <b>bloating.</b> It was found that molding pressure effects defect formation.
