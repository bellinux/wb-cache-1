He also founded and helped create the Prescott hill climb. His 1950 book Horseless Carriage contains a diatribe against the emergence of mass production in the English car industry, claiming that [...] "mass production methods must develop towards the ultimate end automatic procreation of machines by machines, although by doing so, they involve either the supersession of men by machines or a continual expansion of production". His preference for traditional craftsmanship helps to explain his subsequent career.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} preview {{trials of the}} busway were held, during which some {{problems}} were encountered, particularly with cyclists using the busway. In one incident a cyclist cycling on the guide beams, rather than the cycle path next to the busway, {{was struck by a}} bus coming in the opposite direction. Trials of recovery procedures should a bus break down were also held, with the test finding that a stranded bus could be connected up and removed within five to ten minutes of a specially-adapted <b>breakdown</b> <b>vehicle</b> reaching the scene. During one preview journey held for journalists on 28 July 2011, Hugh Morris of the Cambridge First newspaper staged a race between the guided bus and a car travelling from Cambridge to St Ives to see which was quickest to reach the end of the track. The car beat the bus by ten minutes, although he noted that the trip had not been held during rush hour, during which the A14 road is noted for congestion. A journey from St Ives to the Cambridge Science Park was found to take 20 minutes.|$|E

40|$|A vehicle-based {{service system}} might be {{susceptible}} to unexpected costs and delays due to unforeseen events, {{such as a}} vehicle breakdown, a traffic accident, a medical emergency, etc. In such situations, a priori algorithmic solution may be deteriorated and fleet plans {{may need to be}} adjusted in real-time {{as a function of the}} dynamic system state. I consider real-time logistics management problems where a vehicle breaks down in the midst of operations. First, a backup vehicle needs to be determined to pick up the passengers/cargo from the <b>breakdown</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and from the breakdown point completing the remaining portion of the planned trip. This backup vehicle can be dispatched from the depot or from the vehicles currently in service. In the former case, it may impose a significant delay if the depot is far away from the breakdown location. In the latter case, the vehicle used as backup may have to change its own schedule. Trips uncompleted by this backup vehicle may have to be further covered by other vehicles. Thus, a good solution should be acquired in conjunction with the status of all other vehicles in the entire network. Yet, the new schedule may be considerably different from the original one after rescheduling is done. These changes may make the crew-rescheduling problem challenging, since it is essential to ensure that all crews know the itinerary of their new trips. Furthermore, the vehicle breakdown may not only delay the current trip that is directly affected by the disruption but also other trips that the <b>breakdown</b> <b>vehicle</b> has to cover in the network. Some of the delayed trips may have to be cancelled. A good approach should consider operating cost, fixed vehicle cost, delay cost, schedule disruption cost as well as trip cancellation cost simultaneously. This real-time logistics management problem has not been properly addressed in the literature. The major contributions of this study are the modeling and formulation of this vehicle rescheduling problem, and the development of some fast algorithms to solve it quickly. The exact algorithms or heuristics are proposed based on the different requirements and assumptions of the problem...|$|E

50|$|A <b>vehicle</b> <b>breakdown</b> is the {{mechanical}} {{failure of a}} motor vehicle {{in such a way}} that the underlying problem prevents the vehicle from being operated at all, or impedes the vehicle's operation so much, that it is very difficult, nearly impossible, or else dangerous to operate. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>breakdowns</b> can occur for a large number of reasons.

40|$|Abstract—Effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (or/and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, called also V 2 X communication) on traffic flow, {{which are}} {{relevant}} for ITS, are numerically studied. To make the study adequate with real measured traffic data, a testbed for wireless vehicle communication {{based on a}} microscopic model {{in the framework of}} threephase traffic theory is developed and discussed. In this testbed, vehicle motion in traffic flow and analyses of a vehicle communication channel access based on IEEE 802. 11 mechanisms, radio propagation modeling, message reception characteristics as well as all other effects associated with ad-hoc networks are integrated into a three-phase traffic flow model. Thus simulations of both vehicle ad-hoc network and traffic flow are integrated onto a single testbed and perform simultaneously. This allows us to make simulations of ad-hoc network performance as well as diverse scenarios of the effect of wireless vehicle communications on traffic flow during simulation times, which can be comparable with real characteristic times in traffic flow. In addition, the testbed allows us to simulate cooperative vehicle motion together with various traffic phenomena, like traffic breakdown at bottlenecks, moving jam emergence, and a possible effect of danger warning massages about the <b>breakdown</b> <b>vehicle</b> on traffic flow.

Vehicle are consists of many spare parts. Paying attention for the spare parts must be considered by every driver. Preventive {{maintenance is}} conducted to decrease costs as a results of used vehicle. When doing preventive maintenance, there are many types of works that should be known by a driver i. e. : checking parts, settlement, replacement, etc. In this study, distance kilometers and operational interval service in periodic level are being consideration to give information about vehicle preventive maintenance areas which is being showed it on board diagnostic warning on vehicle dashboard. In this study, the two parameters generally determine vehicle preventive maintenance diagnostic as the impact of them as long as a periodic time. Instrument process by using fuzzy design which can show us about stepping that should have to be done when it is working. When reading the information from on board diagnostic, the position of diagnostic instrument can show if it is the time for setting, checking or replacing of all parts. There are some conditions can be showed by instrumentation designing. Firstly, when the diagnostic position is showing null level can express that it is not being necessary to do anything for doing maintenance time. At the second, when diagnostic position is between at null level and one level the instrument can give the information needs to be checked at the areas of preventive maintenance including i. e. checked, settling and replacing of the spare parts to be maintained.
