What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by <b>Blunt,</b> then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war.

40|$|The apex {{of human}} vertebro-basilar {{junctions}} can be sharp-edged or <b>blunted.</b> In the present study, {{the effect of}} a <b>blunted</b> apex on the flow in vertebro-basilar junction models is investigated We compared the flow phenomena in a series of junction model with <b>blunted</b> apices and confluence angles 45, 85, and 125 deg with the flow phenomena in a series of junction models with sharp-edged apices and the same range of confluence angles, studied in a previous paper (Ravensbergen et al., 1996 b). The <b>blunting</b> of the apex appears to {{have an effect on the}} size of the local recirculation area near the apex and the prevailing low velocities. Large recirculation areas are found in the model with <b>blunted</b> apices, especially in those with small confluence angles. In addition, the <b>blunting</b> of the apex has no influence on the flow further downstream, nor on the structure and strength of the secondary flow field. Further more, a <b>blunted</b> apex appears to be a geometric risk factor for atherosclerosis.

5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of <b>blunt</b> injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in <b>blunt</b> chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of <b>blunt</b> chest trauma deaths. In people with <b>blunt</b> trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of <b>blunt</b> chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E

50|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) was previously {{known to cause}} negative feelings, such as depressed mood, re-experiencing and hyperarousal. However, recently, psychologists have started to focus their attention on the <b>blunted</b> affects and also the decrease in feeling and expressing positive emotions in PTSD patients. <b>Blunted</b> affect, or emotional numbness, {{is considered one of}} the consequences of PTSD because it causes a diminished interest in activities that produce pleasure (anhedonia) and produces feelings of detachment from others, restricted emotional expression and a reduced tendency to express emotions behaviorally. <b>Blunted</b> affect is often seen in veterans as a consequence of the psychological stressful experiences that caused PTSD. <b>Blunted</b> affect is a response to PTSD, it {{is considered one of the}} central symptoms in post-traumatic {{stress disorder}}s and it is often seen in veterans who served in combat zones. In PTSD, <b>blunted</b> affect can be considered a psychological response to PTSD as a way to combat overwhelming anxiety that the patients feel.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ductile <b>blunting</b> under plane stress conditions in cracked polycarbonate plates was studied. Because {{this phenomenon is}} intimately connected {{with the amount of}} crack opening displacement (CTOD) and its analogous {{phenomenon of}} crack tip advance displacement (CTAD), a study was undertaken of the mechanism of the development of <b>blunting</b> by evaluating the mode of evolution of CTOD and CTAD in the specimens. As study by scanning electron microscopy is limited to a thin layer of the surface of the specimen, this method is most convenient for studying <b>blunting</b> phenomena under plane-stress conditions.

40|$|<b>Blunted</b> {{cardiovascular}} reactivity to acute {{psychological stress}} {{has been linked}} to a range of adverse health and behavioral outcomes. However, the origins of <b>blunted</b> reactivity remain unclear. The current study aimed to explore the following possibilities: different appraisals of task stressfulness and/or difficulty, diminished task effort, or reduced physiological capacity to respond. Individuals characterized, via pre-screening, as <b>blunted</b> (n = 17) or exaggerated (n = 16) heart rate (HR) reactors to acute psychological stress (socially evaluative mental arithmetic) were exposed to a psychological stress, cold pressor and exercise tasks during a follow-up testing session while HR and blood pressure (BP) were measured. At follow-up, groups again mounted significantly different HR reactions to psychological stress, despite reporting similar levels of subjective stress and difficulty, and achieving similar tasks scores (measure of task effort) at both testing sessions. In response to the cold pressor and exercise <b>blunted</b> and exaggerated reactors displayed similar HR and BP responses. Results indicated that <b>blunted</b> reactors do not differ from exaggerated reactors on appraisals of task stressfulness or difficulty, or objective task effort, and do possess the physiological capacity to respond to other laboratory challenges. Other sources of <b>blunted</b> stress reactivity remain to be explored...|$|R
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) imaging consistently shows <b>blunted</b> striatal dopamine release and decreased dopamine D 2 receptor availability in addiction. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical studies indicating that this neurobiological phenotype {{is likely to}} be both a consequence of chronic drug consumption and a vulnerability factor in the development of addiction. We propose that, behaviorally, <b>blunted</b> striatal dopamine transmission could reflect the increased impulsivity and altered cost/benefit computations that are associated with addiction. The factors that influence <b>blunted</b> striatal dopamine transmission in addiction are unknown. Herein, we give an overview of various factors, genetic, environmental, and social, that are known to affect dopamine transmission and that have been associated with the vulnerability to develop addiction. Altogether, these data suggest that <b>blunted</b> dopamine transmission and decreased D 2 receptor availability are biomarkers both for the development of addiction and resistance to treatment. These findings support the view that <b>blunted</b> dopamine reflects impulsive behavior and deficits in motivation, which lead to the escalation of drug use...|$|R

40|$|Our {{emotions}} don’t have {{lives of}} their own, but mutually influence each other across time. Augmentation and <b>blunting</b> occur when experience of a current emotion increases or decreases the experience of another, subsequent emotion, and {{play a role in}} many everyday phenomena. In this study, we investigated patterns of augmentation and <b>blunting</b> between the experience of anger, sadness, relaxation, and happiness in daily life. In general, emotions with similar (opposite) valence showed augmentation (<b>blunting)</b> from one moment to the next. In search for a possible underlying mechanism, we showed that strength of augmentation and <b>blunting</b> was a function of degree of idiosyncratic appraisal overlap between two emotional states. This occurred even to the point that emotions with similar valence <b>blunted</b> one another in cases of small overlap, and emotions with opposite valence augmented one another in cases of large overlap.

40|$|A {{study of}} ductile <b>blunting</b> edge cracks in tensile {{specimens}} was undertaken {{in this paper}} by detecting the forms of different stages of <b>blunting</b> of the cracks under conditions of mode-l deformation as the loading progressed.

It was shown that an intermediate type of <b>blunting</b> was detected on the surfaces of the specimens by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and this was explained by the fact that at the surfaces of specimens possessing a significant thickness to width aspect ratio the state of stress at the surface is strongly influenced by the plane stress conditions prevailing at the lateral faces of the specimens. © 1989 Chapman and Hall Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Three J-integral {{methods and}} their {{modified}} versions {{have been used}} to characterize the fracture toughness of high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) with different thicknesses. The J c values obtained were highest from the E 813 - 87 method, followed by the E 813 - 81 method, then by the hysteresis method. The hysteresis method based on the steep rising of hysteresis energy under constant displacement-controlled loading in J c determination has many ad-vantages over the ASTM E 813 - 81 or the E 813 - 87 method. The requirement of crack growth length measurements is no longer necessary and the controversial issue on the crack <b>blunting</b> line can also be avoided. The E 813 - 87 method resulted in significantly higher J c values for polymers, but the modified version of E 813 - 87, by moving the offset line from the original 0. 2 to 0. 1 mm, resulted in comparable Jc values. Since crazes as the main failure mechanism for HIPS, well-defined crack <b>blunting</b> does not expect to occur and the J c obtained by the original E 813 - 81 based on the theoretically predicted <b>blunting</b> line is indeed slightly higher. The modified version of E 813 - 81 by neglecting the <b>blunting</b> line in J c determination is believed to be more reasonable for HIPS. The nature of polymers will determine whether the crack tip will be <b>blunted,</b> partially <b>blunted,</b> or not <b>blunted.</b> ASTM E 813 - 81 is appropriate for those polymers with a well-defined <b>blunted</b> crack tip (such as elastomer-modified poly-carbonate), whereas the modified version of ASTM E 813 - 81 seems better for those polymers with craze as the main failure mechanism (such as HIPS). Experimental results indicated that this hysteresis method is able to inherently adjust the crack <b>blunting</b> effect and therefore can be applied to any type of ductile polymer. 0 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
