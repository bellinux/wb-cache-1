5|$|Charles E. <b>Barber</b> {{was born}} in London in 1840. His grandfather, John <b>Barber,</b> led the family to America in the early 1850s. Both John and his son William were {{engravers}} and Charles followed in their footsteps. The <b>Barber</b> family initially lived in Boston upon their arrival to the United States, though they later moved to Providence to allow William {{to work for the}} Gorham Manufacturing Company. William Barber's skills {{came to the attention of}} Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre, who hired him as an assistant engraver in 1865; when Longacre died in 1869, William <b>Barber</b> became chief engraver and Charles was hired as an assistant engraver.|$|E
5|$|The badge {{lacked the}} {{inscriptions}} required for coins; to accommodate them, <b>Barber</b> shrank the design, surrounding it with letters. The ship {{on the reverse}} did not have sufficient detail in Warner's version; <b>Barber</b> requested {{a photograph of the}} caravel to be exhibited at the fair from Ellsworth, then turned the reverse over to his assistant, George T. Morgan. The chief engraver had discerned Ellsworth's desire to have the Lotto portrait used, and several times in October wrote warmly to him, apprising him of progress. By October 17, <b>Barber</b> had completed test dies; by the 31st, trial strikes were made and <b>Barber</b> informed Ellsworth that Leech had pronounced them the best-looking coins ever struck by the Mint. The Mint Director had micromanaged the fine-tuning of the designs for the <b>Barber</b> coinage the previous year; this time he did not intervene, and departed on November 9 for a monetary conference in Brussels.|$|E

5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto painting to Leech, who consulted with <b>Barber</b> and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that <b>Barber</b> could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to <b>Barber</b> in Philadelphia. <b>Barber</b> prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was negative, and the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{health hazards}} {{including}} communicable diseases and skin conditions {{are associated with}} Barbers’ profession to which their visitors are exposed. Thus, knowledge and practice of <b>Barbers</b> would play a vital part in prevention and control of these health hazards. So, {{the aim of this}} study is to assess knowledge and practice, and associated factors among <b>barbers</b> about biological hazards associated with their profession in Gondar town, North West Ethiopia. Methods To assess knowledge and practice, and associated factors among <b>barbers</b> about biological hazards associated with their profession in Gondar town, North West Ethiopia, A work place based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 28 to April 6, 2012. The total numbers of <b>Barbers</b> in the town were 960 of which 400 <b>Barbers</b> were participated in the study. Sample size was determined using the formula for single population proportion by considering, 51 % proportion, knowledgeable <b>Barbers</b> from Jimma, Ethiopia, 95 % level of confidence, 5 % margin of error and 15 % none response rate. The numbers of <b>barbers</b> included in the study were selected by using systematic random sampling. Data was collected by face to face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. Binary and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice of <b>barbers.</b> Results Of 400 <b>barbers,</b> only 72 (18 %) had good knowledge about biological hazards associated to their profession, While only 61 (15. 3 %) were practicing safely during <b>barbering.</b> Knowledge of the <b>barbers</b> was associated significantly with educational level, owner of the business, working hour and work experience, while practice was associated only with availability of UV sterilizers in the room and working hour. Conclusion Barbers’ practice and knowledge to prevent biological hazards associated with their profession is very poor. Thus, giving training for the <b>Barbers</b> is required toward prevention of biological hazards associated to their profession. </p...|$|R

5|$|Although <b>Barber</b> did {{not play}} any more Tests, his scoring was {{consistent}} in the four seasons up until World War II. In all but 1936 (he scored 993 runs that year), he scored around 1,500 runs and in all but 1938 (he averaged just under 34), he averaged between 36 and 38. He was second in the Yorkshire batting averages in 1936, fourth in 1937 and 1939 but slipped to sixth in 1938. Following the war, <b>Barber</b> played one more full season, scoring 1,170 runs {{at an average of}} 30.00 in 1946 to be fourth in the Yorkshire averages. It was the eighth and final time he passed 1,000 runs in a season. During these seasons, Barber's runs contributed to Yorkshire being County Champions in four consecutive seasons from 1937 to 1939 and then again after the war in 1946. He played a further three matches in 1947 to bring his career to a close. From 1932, when <b>Barber</b> became a regular player, until his last full season in 1946, he was part of a Championship winning side seven times.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barber</b> {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington.

Preston sent the coins to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. <b>Barber</b> was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E

5|$|In 1646, {{the council}} allowed the <b>Barber</b> Surgeons {{to build their}} hall {{just east of the}} site: this {{agreement}} was given on 15 March 1647.

A second hall built in 1730 disappeared under the railway viaduct in the 1840s. The most aged claimants were preferred for placements at the Hospital and on 22 March 1779, the Mayor and common council of Newcastle ordered that several candidates produce certificates to prove their respective ages, to be filed in the town-clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. <b>Barber,</b> slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} suggest that he most likely did {{it as part of}} a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles <b>Barber</b> was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office.

The Commission rejected the <b>Barber</b> and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
5000|$|In modern times, {{the term}} [...] "barber" [...] is used {{both as a}} {{professional}} title and to refer to hairdressers who specialize in men's hair.

40|$|<b>Barbering,</b> where a "barber" mouse plucks {{hair from}} its cagemates or itself, {{is both a}} spontaneously {{occurring}} abnormal behavior in mice and a well validated model of Trichotillomania (TTM). N-Acetylcysteine, (NAC) a cysteine derived food additive, is remarkably effective in treating TTM patients, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), also known as free radicals, form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen. Under normal circumstances, cells are able to defend themselves against ROS damage with antioxidant pathways. NAC is the precursor to the main antioxidant produced to defend the brain. Therefore, we hypothesized that <b>barbering</b> is a disease of oxidative stress, whereby ROS and/or a failure of antioxidant defenses leads to neuronal damage that induces <b>barbering</b> in susceptible animals. We tested this hypothesis in 32 female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by treating half with 1 g/kg BW/day of NAC in their diet, and testing for protection against developing <b>barbering</b> behavior and curing of <b>barbering</b> behavior, and simultaneously testing for a panel of biomarkers of oxidative stress. NAC reduced the chance that mice would be <b>barbers,</b> and this effect did not differ between healthy (i. e. prevention) and affected animals (i. e. cure). <b>Barbering</b> animals had elevated urinary antioxidant capacity, indicative of oxidative stress, at all timepoints. Additionally, after treatment the risk of <b>barbering</b> increased with decreasing hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) levels, and with increasing glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels, further indicating that <b>barbering</b> mice were under oxidative stress regardless of treatment with NAC. We did not find compelling evidence that urinary total antioxidant capacity, or urinary 8 -OHdG, could predict response to NAC treatment. We conclude that NAC is effective in preventing and/or curing <b>barbering</b> {{at least in part}} by promoting GSH synthesis, thereby preventing oxidative damage...|$|R
