2500|$|The <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> in {{its current}} form {{developed}} from the violent clash between the rival Nirankari and Akhand Kirtani Jatha (AKJ) sects on the festival of Vaisakhi in India on 13 April 1978, where thirteen Sikhs were killed. The founders of this Panthic group vowed to avenge the deaths of Sikhs. Talwinder Singh Parmar led the militant wing of AKJ, which became the <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa,</b> to [...] "punish" [...] the Nirankaris.

The <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> was considered the most dangerous, well-armed, and puritanical of the various Sikh militant organisations fighting Indian rule in Punjab. Whereas other militant organisations made some compromise with the tenets of Sikhism during the militancy period, <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> stood alone in its insistence on the strict compliance of the rules of the Khalsa brotherhood. According to C. Christine Fair, <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> was more concerned with propagating the ideas of Sikhism, than with the actual Khalistan movement.|$|R

50|$|The name <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> {{is taken}} from the Babbar Akali Movement of 1920, which {{agitated}} against British colonial rule in India. The modern-day <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> was created {{as a result of}} the bloody clash on April 13, 1978, between a group of Amritdhari Sikhs of Akhand Kirtani Jatha who went to protest against a gathering of the rival Nirankari sect. The confrontation led to the murder of thirteen demonstrators. When a criminal case was filed against the Nirankari leader, he had his case transferred to neighboring Haryana state, where he was acquitted the following year. This gave rise to new organisational expressions of Sikh aspirations outside the Akali party, and an angry sentiment that if the government and judiciary would not prosecute enemies of Sikhism, taking extrajudical measures could be justified to avenge the death of Sikhs. Among the chief proponents of this attitude was the <b>Babbar</b> <b>Khalsa</b> founded by Talwinder Singh Parmar.|$|R
