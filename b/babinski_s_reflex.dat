The effect of Jendrassik 2 ̆ 7 s method on H-wave was still remarkable after procaine narcosis of the γ fibre in the tibial nerve. This fact postulates the direct facilitory tract from the upper center. In order to elucidate this mechanism, influence of electrical stimulation of the radial nerve on H-wave was examined. The enlargement of the H-wave was recorded about 100 〜 150 msec, after the stimulus. In this method, the participation of cortical motor area is always denied and only muscle movement is related. From the lapse of time it may be inferred that there is a facilitatory tract through which impulses ascend to the upper centers and then descend to the leg.

40|$|By {{means of}} the evoked electromyogram, we studied {{variation}} of H wave in the normal and in patients who were suffering from spasticity or rigidity, and influence of Jendrassik 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reflex</b> reinforcement to H wave. The H wave was elucited by stimulation of the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa and recorded from the soleus muscle with surface electrodes as stimulating and recording electrodes. I) Hitherto we believed that the frequency distribution of amplitude of H wave (H) was in accordance with normal distribution and we applied arithmetic mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation to clinical analysis. As a result of more precise analysis of frequency distribution of H in above stated three cases, the said factors are still practically applicable, however, {{it became apparent that}} they held not always true. 1. The principle of frequency distribution of H passes for in three cases, i. g. the normal, the spasticity and the rigidity. 2. The frequency distribution of the greatest H without M is the reprensentative of frequency distribution at any magnitude of H. 3. It proved that a hundred or more H were sufficient to get a frequency distribution of H and it belongs to binominal distribution. Its factors are arithmetic mean, mode, median, quartile distance, relative quartile distance from the point of mode relative distance from the point of median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness and binominal probability. It can be divided into two parts: one is an area of accumulation, the other is an area of scatter. The distribution is pathognomonic in the normal, the spastic and the rigid respectively. 4. The form of frequency distribution can be modified by medicine. The medicine which works facilitatory to the central nervous system modifies the curve in distal part origin. The medicine which works inhibitory to H wave modifies it in proximal part from origin. From these points it is considered that pathophysiological differences between the normal and the spastic or the rigid lie in the fault of mechanism which controls the frequency distribution of H and we propose that analysis of the frequency distribution of H can be applicable in clinical neurology. II) Often a clear response can be obtained while the subject tightly clasps his hands together and pulls or grips tightly. This is the method used to produce reflex reinforcement of tendon jerks termed Jendrassik 2 ̆ 7 s maneuver. It has been suggested that this mechanism is attributable to the avertion of the subject 2 ̆ 7 s attention from his leg to his hand which calls forth overflowing of impulses. But some authors asserted that it was due to an increased fusimotor discharge to motoneurons via gamma-loop. Our opinions are as follows. 1.

In 1751, before he had published his formal analysis of the reflex are, Whytt described the direct and consensual pupillary response to light and the pupillary response to accommodation. On the basis of some simple, well conceived and controlled observations, Whytt showed that the pupillary response was not due to a direct effect of light on the uvea or pupillary muscles, but involved light acting on the retina, leading to an activation of the optic nerve which caused the sentinent principal within the neuraxis to produce pupillary constriction via the activity of the nerves to the pupillary muscles.

40|$|Spinal {{reflexes}} in {{the rabbit}} are suppressed tonically by endogenous opioids. The contributions made to this suppression by mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors {{have been investigated}} by studying {{the actions of a}} range of opioid antagonists and agonists on reflexes evoked by sural nerve stimulation in the ankle extensor gastrocnemius medialis (g. m.), and in the knee flexor semitendinosus (s. t.). When given at a total dose of 88. 5 micrograms kg- 1 i. v., either of the universal opioid receptor antagonists (-) -naloxone and (-) -quadazocine enhanced the g. m. response to more than 7 times the pre-drug control values, and the <b>s.</b> t. <b>reflex</b> to 1. 5 times controls. The effects of quadazocine were stereospecific. The selective delta antagonist ICI 174864 (3. 5 mg kg- 1 i. v. total) also augmented the g. m. reflex but only to twice pre-drug controls. The mu-agonists fentanyl (100 micrograms kg- 1) and morphine (50 mg kg- 1) suppressed both g. m. and <b>s.</b> t. <b>reflex</b> responses to less than half control levels by a naloxone-reversible mechanism. The kappa-agonists bremazocine (50 micrograms kg- 1 total), tifluadom (100 micrograms kg- 1), ethylketocyclazocine (200 micrograms kg- 1) and U 50488 H (1 mg kg- 1) potentiated the g. m. reflex and had variable effects on the s. t. response. Naloxone usually added to the facilitatory actions of these drugs. kappa-Opioid receptor agonists also caused a profound, naloxone-reversible depression of arterial blood pressure. It may be concluded that the endogenous opioid-mediated suppression of spinal reflexes in the rabbit is mediated mainly, if not exclusively, through mu-receptors. There are no known endogenous ligands which are specific for the mu-receptor, so in the present case it seems that selectivity is determined by the receptor population rather than by the ligand...|$|R

40|$|Although Tarlov, or perineural cysts (TC) {{can easily}} be seen on MRI, they are mostly {{considered}} asymptomatic and therefore overlooked as a possible cause of sacral and sciatic pain, as well as urogenital and bowel problems. This {{is especially true for}} smaller cysts. Moreover, there are only few diagnostic characteristics {{that can be used to}} confirm or exclude that the cysts are the cause of the symptoms. As a consequence, controversy remains regarding their clinical importance. Because of this underdiagnosed condition, patients often suffer for several years from unrecognized chronic neuropathic pain and neurological disorders. We present case reports of patients with giant and smaller symptomatic sacral TC, in which electromyography was performed in order to demonstrate nerve involvement. Electromyographic examination included studies of the sural nerve (S 1 S 2) and the <b>S</b> 1 -Hoffmann <b>reflexes,</b> as well as a needle EMG of the gastrocnemius muscle (S 1), the tibial nerve innervated intrinsic foot muscles (S 2), the external anal sphincter (S 3 S 4), and the ano-anal <b>reflex</b> (<b>S</b> 3 S 4). We conclude that electromyography of the sacral nerve roots can be a powerful tool for documenting nerve dysfunction in symptomatic TC, as well as for their differentiation from other pathological entities causing sacral pain and sciatica. Moreover, using electromyography, it was documented that smaller cysts of less than 1 cm can cause debilitating symptoms. Therefore, the incidence of symptomatic TC may be higher than initially suspected. In patients with sacral or perineal pain, and/or sciatica, especially when in combination with urogenital and bowel symptoms, the presence of TC should be taken in consideration. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{carbon and}} glass fiber composite with epoxy resin. The wings have an elliptical planform, vertical or elliptical design winglets. The wing structure includes {{extensive use of}} carbon fiber, both in the sandwich skins and in the tapered I-beam wing spar which uses pultruded carbon rods for the spar caps. The wing geometry is notable in that it varies non-linearly from the root to the tip, both in overall planform shape and in wing section profile. The flaperons stretch for 11.0 meters of the full wingspan and their range of motion varies from positive landing L +8°, to +4° for thermalling, to 0°, -4°, and <b>S</b> -8° <b>reflex</b> positions for cruising. Schempp-Hirth-type spoilers extend on the upper wing surface only. Opening the single-element spoilers with stick held results in a noticeable nose-down pitch movement. This, however, can easily be avoided by maintaining the nose attitude relative to the horizon; doing this will cause little airspeed change. Closing the spoilers has a similar pitch-up effect, again easily controlled with stick movement. On approach, the spoilers are moderately effective. Descent rate can be quickly increased by slipping. At approach speed with spoilers out, {{there is a clear}} view ahead over the nose.|$|R

If the prestimulus duration is longer than 1; <b>s,</b> blink <b>reflex</b> amplitude is facilitated. The present study investigated the effect of repeated presentations of prestimulus-blink eliciting stimulus pairings on blink reflex modulation. Subjects in Experiment 1 (N = 59) were presented with a sequence of 12 blocks of 7 trials. Within each block, one trial was a blink stimulus alone, whereas the blink stimulus was preceded by a prestimulus on the other trials. Prestimulus intervals were 30, 60, 120, 240, 500 and 2000 ms. Prestimuli were presented continuously throughout the prepulse interval. The amount of reflex magnitude inhibition at the 60, 120, 240 and 500 ms lead intervals and reflex latency shortening at 30 and 60 ms decreased over blocks. The amount of reflex facilitation at a lead interval of 2000 ms was not reduced. In Experiment 2 (N = 22), two groups of subjects were presented with a sequence of blink stimulus alone presentations and prestimulus-blink stimulus pairings. The prestimulus lasted for 120 ms in one group and for 200 ms in the second. Blink reflex magnitude inhibition declined in both groups over blocks of trials. However, the groups also differed in responding on the blink stimulus alone control trials. Experiment 3 (N = 24) employed the same design as did Experiment 2. No difference in control responding was found. Similar to Experiment 2, blink inhibition decreased over repeated trials in both groups. The present results indicate that prepulse inhibition reflects a process which is affected by repeated presentation of prestimulus-reflex stimulus pairings.

40|$|The {{depressant}} {{actions of}} protoveratine A or B is practically independent from its bradicardiac action. After the atropinization the intravenous injection tends to elicit not seldom the slight {{extent of the}} transitory sinus tachycardia. It is very rarely observed that the depressant action can be hardly recognized despite of the bradycardia; however even in such a dissociation when the dose of protoveratrine is augmented, the blood pressure level may be usually lowered. A large amount of protoveratrine may cause besides various degree of heart block, extrasystoles and allied arrhythmias. In man such arrhythmias may begin to appear 152 ̆ 2 after the intravenous injection and then persist for some minuetes. The patients oversensitive to digitalis is used to show also the hypersensitivity to the protoveratrine. When blood pressure is sufficiently lowered, there takes plase sometimes transitorily a high steeple T in ecg., or {{an increase in the}} positivity of T which was previously flat or negative; these facts can be, as a rule, earily found,in T of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s levogram. But on the other hand, there may be observed also a minority of cases which accentuate the left ventricular strain pattern in hypertension by the use of protoveratrine. In short, the response of T to protoveratrine is fairly variable from case to case. By the administration of protoveratrine, cardiac output increases or decreases in its amount as the case may be. This change in cardiac output shows no intimate relationship to that in pulse rate. Generally the augmented left cardiac work develops a tendency to be reduced. Protoveratrine does not essentially influence upon the modes of responses of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Protoveratrine does not markedly modify the result of cold pressor test, even if it were so, it inhibits merely to slight extent. There can not be seen any striking change in GFR and RBF, yet protoveratrine reduces infrequently them, to certain degree. So far as the heart of dog is concerned, there exists some significant difference in the modes of pharmacological action between veratridine and protoveratrine. The intravenous injection of veratridine causes moderately both bradycardia and arterial hypotension. By the intravenous application, the hypotension of veratridine is rather shorter in duration than that of protoveratrine at the equimiligram. The sufficient doses of each drug show a fairly transitory effect in depressing pulmonary ventilation, mainly respiratory rates. After bilateral cervical vagotomy there can be found practically no longer any bradycardia and hypotension of veratridine, therefore these actions of veatridine may appear at least largely via Bezold-Jarisch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reflex</b> as many authors emphasize. The bradycardiac action of protoveratrine is also abolished by the bilateral vagotomy, but the hypotension still remains to a certain extent. However in the same dog the denervation of bothsided carotid sinus areas after the bilateral vagotomy almost completely surpresses the protoveratrine hypotension at the same amount. The direct administration of protoveratrine to the carotid sinus regions causes fall in blood pressure and reduces the heart rates, consequently protoveratrine is likely to be active not only on Bezold-Jarisch 2 ̆ 7 s receptors but also on carotid sinus baroreceptors. After the bilateral resection of carotid sinus nerves and cervical vagosympathetic trunks, the intravenous injection of further increased dose of protoveratine or veratridine enhances the secondary rise of blood pressure and the active heterotopic tachycardia, but the respiratory inhibition remains almost unchanged. Such a difference in pharmacological action between veratridine and protoveratrine may be data to go upon the availability of the combined use of two drugs. In man the therapeutic doses of protoveratine A and B cause the sinus bradycardia which can be easily inhibited by atropinization...|$|R

Sixteen PD patients who underwent STN-DBS were studied in four experimental conditions: without STN-DBS and without L-dopa, STN-DBS alone, L-dopa alone and STN-DBS plus L-dopa. The results were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy controls. Voluntary blinking was assessed by asking participants to blink as fast as possible; spontaneous blinking was recorded during two 60 <b>s</b> rest periods; <b>reflex</b> blinking was evoked by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve. Blinking were recorded and analysed with the SMART motion system. STN-DBS increased the peak velocity and amplitude for both the closing and opening voluntary blink phases, but prolonged the inter-phase pause duration. L-dopa had no effects on voluntary blinking but reversed the increased inter-phase pause duration seen during STN-DBS. Spontaneous blink rate increased after either STN-DBS or L-dopa. Reflex blinking kinematics were not modified by STN-DBS or L-dopa. The STN-DBS effects on voluntary blinking kinematics and spontaneous blinking rate may occur as results of changes of cortico-basal ganglia activity. The prolonged pause duration of voluntary blinking indicates that STN-DBS has {{detrimental effects on the}} cranial region. These results also shed light on the pathophysiology of eyelids opening apraxia following STN-DBS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Balto-Slavic are Albanian and Indo-Iranian. Together with Armenian and Thracian, {{these are the}} satǝm languages, which together with Greek and Phrygian constitute {{the eastern part of}} Classic Indo-European. The obvious common development in this area is the satǝm palatalization, which did not affect Greek and Phrygian. Indo-Iranian was separated from the other satǝm languages by the depalatalization of palatovelars before resonants in the latter. Proto-Indo-European had a threefold distinction between fortis, glottalic lenis, and plain lenis obstruents, all of them voiceless, e. g. *t [t:], *d [ť], *dh [t]. In the Classic Indo-European languages (after their separation from Anatolian and Tocharian), the lenis obstruents became voiced [ʔd], [d], while the fortis remained voiceless [t]. This system was best preserved in Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic and Albanian. Another development that seems to be dialectal Indo-European is the retraction of *s to *ṣ after *i, *u, *r, *k in Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic, Albanian and Armenian. However, this retraction cannot be dated and may have affected any part of the IndoEuropean dialects. This may also explain the Hittite <b>reflex</b> <b>š</b> of PIE *s.

On the other hand, the repetitive stimulation (1 stimulation/ 1 <b>s)</b> induced spinal <b>reflex</b> potentiation (SRP) that was attenuated by intrathecal 6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 4 -dione (a glutamatergic alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazoleproprionat receptor antagonist, 100 mu M, 10 mu l) and D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate [a glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, 100 mu M, 10 mu l]. Acute anal stretch using a mosquito clamp with a distance of 4 mm exhibited no effect, whereas distances of 8 mm attenuated and 12 mm abolished the repetitive stimulation-induced SRP. Intrathecal NMDA (100 mu M, 10 mu l) reversed the abolition on SRP caused by anal stretch. On the other hand, pretreated bicuculline [gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor antagonist, 100 mu M, 10 mu l] but not hydroxysaclofen (GABA(B) receptor antagonist) counteracted the abolition on the repetitive stimulation-induced SRP caused by the anal stretch. All of the results suggested that anal stretch {{may be used as}} an adjunct to assist voiding dysfunction in patients with overactive urethra sphincter and that GABAergic neurotransmission is important in the neural mechanisms underlying external urethra sphincter activity inhibited by anal stretch...|$|R
5000|$|Their caste or order's origin {{is often}} linked {{to that of}} the Dacian priests. The term [...] "Solomonar" [...] ("solomonar" [...] - singular, [...] "solomonars" [...] - plural) started {{to be used in the}} Middle Ages {{probably}} under the influence of the Judeo-Christian culture. It is of uncertain origin, though popularly it is connected to King Solomon via the addition of the occupational suffix [...] "-ar". Another theory derives it from German Schulmänner ("scholars") in reference to the popular belief that solomonars attended a school. Friedrich von Müller (1857) reported the connection to King Solomon, along with a story from Schäßburg (Sighișoara in Transylvania) in which a Romanian mistook a robed student for a solomonar. The meaning of the term is very similar if not identical in all its occurrences because it always refers to an enchanter (practitioner of magic based on incantation), a summoner and master of high and subtle energies. A number of synonyms can be found in Romanian, including [...] "zgrimințeș", and it is considered synonymous or closely connected to the widespread Balkan legend known in Serbo-Croatian (for example) as grabancijas dijak ("the necromancy student"). Some authors associate them with the legendary Scholomance and give the term as Scholomonariu, one particularly early instance in a glossary (Scholomonáriu, defined as Zauberer, [...] "sorcerer") dating from 1781. As well as alternating the initial consonant between s /s/ and <b>ş</b> /ʃ/, earlier <b>reflexes</b> of the word in Romanian may add [...] "-i" [...] and the regular [...] "-u" [...] formerly found in the noun declension.|$|R
40|$|Alexander's law, the eye {{position}} dependency of nystagmus due to peripheral vestibular lesions, {{has been}} hypothesized to occur due to adaptive {{changes in the}} brainstem velocity-to-position neural integrator in response to non-reciprocal vestibular stimulation. We investigated whether it develops during passive head rotations that produce constant nystagmus for > 35 s. The yaw rotation stimulus consisted of a 1 -s acceleration (100 °/s(2)), followed by a lower acceleration ramp (starting at 7. 3 °/s(2) and increasing at 0. 04 °/s(2) /s) until 400 °/s was reached after 38 s. This stimulus was designed to offset the ~ 15 <b>s</b> vestibular ocular <b>reflex</b> time constant (and the 150 s adaptation time constant) and produce constant velocity slow phases. In contrast to peripheral lesions, this vestibular stimulation {{is the result of}} real head turns and has the push-pull characteristics of natural movements. The procedure was successful, as the average velocity of 31 °/s was unchanged over the final 35 s of the acceleration period. In all 10 healthy human subjects, we found a large and stable Alexander's law, with an average velocity-versus-position slope of - 0. 366 in the first half that was not significantly different in the second half, - 0. 347. These slopes correspond to integrator time constants of < 3 s, are much less than normal time constants (~ 25 s), and are similar to those observed in patients with peripheral vestibular lesions. Alexander's law also developed, on average, in 10 s. We conclude that Alexander's law is not simply a consequence of non-reciprocal vestibular stimulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{perphenazine}} have been determined in various preparations, {{and the following}} properties were noted : 1) Intraperitoneal (in cats) and per oral (in monkeys) administrations of doses from 2. 5 to 5 mg/kg of perphenazine induced effective sedation in the animals. 2) In rabbits and cats, arterial blood pressure was decreased by intravenous injection of 0. 5 mg/kg or more of perphenazine. 3) Administration of perphenazine in doses from 0. 2 to 1 mg per animal into the lateral ventricle produced less decrease of blood pressure in rabbits {{as compared with the}} case of intravenous injection of the drug. 4) Perphenazine showed a potent adrenolytic action in blood pressure and in contraction of the nictitating membrane of cats. 5) Anti-acetylcholine property of perphenazine was observed in frog rectus muscle or isolated mouse ileum preparations, but the potency was a little less than the action of chlorpromazine. 6) As chlorpromazine, perphenazine possesses an autonomic ganglionic blocking action, as seen in the recording of postganglionic potentials of the superior cervical ganglion of cats. 7) Perphenazine depressed the cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> spinal cord <b>reflex</b> potentials; however the action was not seen in the spinal preparation. 8) Perphenazine has no depressant effect on the neuromuscular transmission of rabbits and rats. 9) Onset of the convulsion induced by pentylenetetrazol or strychnine in mice was not changed by pretreatment of perphenazine; however the time of death was apparently prolonged. 10) In electrocorticogram of cats, the arousal response induced by acoustic stimuli was effectively suppressed by perphenazine...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relative}} {{roles of}} forebrain and brainstem in producing adequate anaesthesia are unclear. METHODS: We simultaneously analysed {{the effects of}} sevoflurane (Group S; n = 18) or propofol (Group P; n = 29) on the bispectral index (BIS) and the first component of the blink reflex (R 1). The dose of anaesthetic agent was increased until loss of blink reflex. After discontinuation and reappearance of blink reflex activity, the amount was increased again. The area under curve R 1 (area-R 1) of the electromyogram of the orbicularis oculi muscle after electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve was measured. Using a sigmoid E(max) model and a first-order rate constant k(e 0), we characterized the dose-response relationships for BIS and area-R 1. RESULTS: Concentration-dependent depression of BIS and area-R 1 was adequately modelled. The concentration that causes an effect midway between minimum and maximum (EC 50) for area-R 1 was smaller than EC 50 for BIS in both groups [0. 34 (0. 19) vs 1. 29 (0. 19) vol% and 1. 78 (0. 65) vs 2. 69 (0. 67) mug ml(- 1); mean (sd) ]. At doses of sevoflurane and propofol with equivalent depression of BIS, sevoflurane depressed area-R 1 more than propofol. The k(e 0) for area-R 1 was about half that for BIS in both groups: 0. 24 (0. 19 - 0. 29) vs 0. 48 (0. 38 - 0. 60) min(- 1) for Group S; 0. 28 (0. 23 - 0. 34) vs 0. 46 (0. 40 - 0. 54) min(- 1) for Group P, geometric mean (95 % CI).

40|$|In humans, {{the amount}} of spinal homonymous {{recurrent}} inhibition during voluntary contraction is usually assessed by using a peripheral nerve stimulation paradigm. This method consists of conditioning the maximal M-wave (SM stimulus) with prior <b>reflex</b> stimulation (<b>S</b> 1), with 10 ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The decrease observed between unconditioned (S 1 only) and conditioned (<b>S</b> 1 +SM) <b>reflex</b> size is then attributed to recurrent inhibition. However, during a voluntary contraction, a superimposed SM stimulation leads to a maximal M-wave followed by a voluntary (V) wave at similar latency than the H-reflex. This wave can therefore interfere with the conditioned H-reflex when two different stimulation intensities are used (S 1 and SM), leading to misinterpretation of the data. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess if conditioning V-wave response instead of H-reflex, by applying SM for both stimuli (test and conditioning), can be used as an index of recurrent inhibition. Conditioned and unconditioned responses of soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles were recorded in twelve subjects at 25 % and at 50 % of maximal voluntary contraction at the usual ISI of 10 ms and an optimal inter-stimulus of 15 ms determined upon M- and V-wave latencies. Conditioned H-reflex (obtained with S 1 +SM paradigm) was significantly lower than the unconditioned by ~ 30 % on average, meaning that {{the amount of}} inhibition was 70 %. This amount of recurrent inhibition was significantly lower at higher force level with both methods. Regardless of the level of force or the conditioning ISI, results obtained with V-wave conditioning (SM+SM) were similar at both force levels, linearly correlated and proportional to those obtained with H conditioning. Then, V-wave conditioning appears to be a reliable index of homonymous recurrent inhibition during voluntary contraction...|$|R
