40|$|Impact hammer is {{the current}} modal testing way in Dynapac testing department. Due to highly damped {{characteristic}} of big construction machines, {{there are a few}} weaknesses for modal testing when using hammer, such as short response time, limited frequency resolution, poor quality of frequency response functions. Therefore, a more advanced excitation equipment is needed to improve the measurement quality. The object for this study is to compare two different measuring methods. The thesis will show a comparison between the hammer testing and the shaker MIMO testing compared with analytical model in a highly damped system. It will also give a reference for further highly damped modal analysis and <b>budgetary</b> <b>assessment</b> to decide the budget expenditure. Result from shaker testing shows a little better correlation than hammer testing compared with FEM model. While the correlation between FEM model and measurement is bad due to many reasons, such as many local modes that can not excited, lack of excitation points, unexpected noise and error from the measurement. While considering the compared results obtained from this machine for now, a simpler structure experiment is suggested to be carried on in the future. Shorter length of stinger can be used to enable higher amplitude of force to excite the property on this machine...|$|E

50|$|In April 2015, the Center for Strategic and <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Assessments</b> (CSBA) {{released}} a report concluding that the next-generation U.S. Air Force fighter should be larger and more resembling a bomber than a small, maneuverable traditional fighter. It analyzed over 1,450 air-to-air engagements since 1965 and found that long-range weapons and sensors have dramatically decreased instances of dogfighting. With the increase of air defense systems using electronic and infrared sensors and high-speed weapons, traditional designs relying on small size, high speed, and maneuverability may be less relevant and easier to intercept. As a result, the CSBA suggests building a fighter significantly larger relying on enhanced sensors, signature control, networked situational awareness, and very-long-range weapons to complete engagements before being detected or tracked. Larger planes would have greater range that {{would enable them to}} be stationed further from a combat zone, have greater radar and IR detection capabilities, and carry bigger and longer-range missiles. One airframe could be fitted with various attachments to fill several roles. The concept of a small number of large, intercontinental and heavily armed combat aircraft could link itself {{to the development of the}} Long Range Strike Bomber.|$|R

50|$|The Navy {{initially}} said Fitzgerald is repairable {{and will}} be back in service within twelve months. A few days later, Navy officials said the superstructure, damaged in the collision, may actually be warped, which could have created misalignment problems for the AN/SPY-1 radar, which was also damaged on the starboard side. Flooding extended to a main engineering space and radio central, destroying equipment worth millions of dollars. As at 30 June, the Navy expected that {{they would be able to}} put her in dry dock between 6 and 8 July. With the need for a new dry dock plan, the damage caused to the hull by the collision could delay the process. Fitzgerald entered a dry dock in Yokosuka on 11 July, in order for the Navy to evaluate the extent of the damage to Fitzgerald before deciding whether to repair the ship in Japan or back in the United States. An analyst at the Center for Strategic and <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Assessments</b> said the repairs could not be done overseas, and the dry dock inspection is mainly to determine if the ship can return to a private shipyard in the US under its own power, or, more likely, must be carried back on a heavy-lift ship. The costs for the repair are expected to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Fitzgerald was scheduled to undergo a planned modernization in 2019, but it is yet unclear if the timeline for that will be affected by the repairs.|$|R
