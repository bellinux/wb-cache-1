5|$|As {{this was}} the first Boy Scouting event, the <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not have uniform shirts, but they did wear khaki scarves and were {{presented}} with brass fleur-de-lis badges, the first use of the Scout emblem. They also wore a coloured knot on their shoulder indicating their patrol: green for Bulls, blue for Wolves, yellow for Curlews, and red for Ravens. The patrol leader carried a staff with a flag depicting the patrol animal. After passing tests on knots, tracking, and the national flag, they were given another brass badge, a scroll with the words Be Prepared, to wear below the fleur-de-lis.|$|E

In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school's Vaudeville Night, singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his horn. He also performed, {{at the invitation of}} his friend Fritz Putzier, in Neal Buckley's Novelty Orchestra. The group was hired for a gig in December 1920, but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, that the <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not have union cards. In an audition before a union executive, Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed. He did not earn his card.|$|E

5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not have.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark {{was taken}} {{from his home in}} Saskatchewan (with the {{permission}} of his mother and reluctant father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott. Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy — until , when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation. Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them. The police found no bodies at the ranch — Clark said they were dumped in the desert — but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five <b>boys,</b> <b>did</b> likewise.|$|E

25|$|The game {{of games}} {{in the history of}} the yellow-and-black took place on 15 April 1959, a rainy Wednesday. Sixty-thousand spectators packed into Wankdorf, but the crowd may have {{exceeded}} the official count. After an impressive performance, YB won 1–0 on a Geni Meier goal in the 13th minute. The game was a legend in Bern. Stade de Reims received the Bernese in the return match at the Parc des Princes, Paris, where the Frenchmen won 3–0 to reach the final.

25|$|The group's surf {{music was}} not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, {{previous}} surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach <b>Boys</b> <b>did.</b> Their early hits helped raise {{the profile of the}} state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. The California Sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Mechelen (at that time part of the Burgundian Netherlands) into {{extremely}} humble circumstances, {{the son of a}} poor cobbler. He received his early education there but quickly transferred to Gouda, where the Brothers of the Common Life ran a famous school along monastic lines. Here Jan developed his preference for a mystical, as opposed to an intellectual, approach to religion, together with a determinedly ascetic approach to religious life. The education he received from the Brothers was a traditional Medieval one, including Grammar and Logic, conducted during long days, interrupted by religious devotions, and accompanied by frugal meals, cold beds and many punishments. However, the ancient writers were not neglected—Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero and Cato were much studied with a view to producing a good Latin style and many moral messages. But he was warned against the views of these pagan authors, to counterbalance which he studied the Bible and the Church Fathers. In particular, he studied the Devotio Moderna; a mystical approach based on Thomas a Kempis's Imitation of Christ—in particular, imitation of his sufferings. Jan paid for his studies, as many poor <b>boys</b> <b>did,</b> by serving in the kitchen, or attending to richer students, and performing menial tasks, such as ringing the bell. According to the anonymous monk who was his first biographer (1519), he could not afford candles, so he read, after a hard day, high up in the bell tower {{by the light of the}} moon. He never managed to develop a good Latin style—it was apparently always rough and full of mistakes—and he knew nothing of the Greek that was kindling the enthusiasm of so many of his contemporaries, but he never lost his love of the severe religious life learned at Gouda.|$|E
500|$|Like many {{of their}} 1970s contemporaries {{including}} Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper, the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery.

In the words of Bebe Buell, [...] "They [...] were like a gang of kids with their own planes, Porsches, millions of dollars, limitless resources.

500|$|In 1919, Harold {{remarried}} and his {{new wife}} raised the children from his first marriage. The two <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> their early schooling at Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's Pasteur Institute. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at Queen's College in Taunton, Somerset on the south coast of England. The headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as [...] "colonials" [...] who were [...] "backward" [...] and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than appropriate. Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private Methodist Wesley College, where he enjoyed mathematics and rowing.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} between the medieval elites was to secure land. Girls {{were married in}} their teens, but <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not marry until they came of age. There is a popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, {{and that it was}} dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the image of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domestic life is a neglected facet. The lady was given a dower of her husband's estates– usually about a third– which was hers for life, and her husband would inherit on her death. It was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land. Despite generally being excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influence within the medieval household, women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises {{the role of women in}} applying [...] "a refined aristocratic taste" [...] to castles due to their long term residence.|$|E

500|$|Bruce R. Jackson was {{the first}} of five {{children}} born to Bruce H. Jackson, Sr and Mavis Jackson, living in Rose Bay, New South Wales. His wealthy parents moved to a mansion in Point Piper, a harbourside suburb east of Sydney in the district of Vaucluse, New South Wales. (The mansion, [...] "Altona", is one of Australia's most expensive homes.) Jackson first expressed an interest in electronics at age 13 when he set up a basement workbench and small lab under his parents' mansion. While at Vaucluse Boys' High School, Jackson was discovered by investigators of the Postmaster-General's Department, along with a group of his electronics-minded schoolmates, Phillip Storey, Wally Pearce, Bruce Morrison and Adrian Wood operating a pirate radio station [...] "2VH", with a too-powerful AM transmitter—which the boys operated during and after school, and on the weekends, tuned to 1350kHz in {{the upper end of the}} commercial AM band to avoid more powerful commercial radio station signals. The <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not know that their tube transmitter and very long, very efficient full wavelength antenna were so well crafted that their unlicensed signal was broadcasting all over Sydney and parts of the state of New South Wales 600km away, at night time.|$|E
500|$|According to Morrow, change {{regarding}} how {{women and girls}} were depicted on Sesame Street occurred slowly. CTW's research staff, which were mostly made up of women, worked with the mostly male production staff to raise their consciousnesses about how women and girls were portrayed in their scripts. Another source of friction between the CTW and feminists were the lack of female Muppets, for which they held Jim Henson responsible, {{as well as his}} organization of all-male puppeteers, who tended to create male characters. The demanding production schedule tended to attract only men, and Henson expressed his opinion that women were incapable of withstanding it. [...] Gikow believed that the difficulty creating breakout Muppet characters was due to children's viewing styles: girls have tended to become attached to male characters they like, but <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not tend to form the same attachments to female characters. [...] The show's inventory of material, some of which many feminists found sexist and which were shown over and over, were slowly replaced by new, less sexist segments. [...] As more female Muppets performers like Fran Brill, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph were hired and trained, stronger female characters like Abby Cadabby were created. As an interesting contrast, Sesame Street was also chastised by a Louisiana critic for the presence of strong single women on the show.|$|E
500|$|The New York {{magazine}} {{said that}} the film's premise of four high-school friends videotaping their senior year [...] "sounds like a fluffy reality show"; Bill Weber of Slant Magazine said, [...] "putting the trials of MTV reality-show prima donnas in perspective, the middle-class quartet will be relatable to this BBC/HBO production's audience in their easy embrace of Western kid stuff ...

[...] Similarly, The Huffington Post raised comparisons with MTV reality shows, but {{was pleased to see}} that the Iraqi <b>boys</b> <b>did</b> not play to the cameras because they had not been exposed to programmes such as [...] or The Paper. That juvenile relief was commented on by many; The Washington Post highlighted Mohammad's adoption of an unwelcome mouse in the house. Hale described a scene where Mohammad and Ali act like hostage and captor. [...] "Suddenly Ali is holding a large knife. 'He's being naughty!' Mohammad says. Ali holds the knife near Mohammad and says, a little too unemotionally: 'Allah! This is the first hostage. I'm going to slaughter him this way.' Mohammad tells him to stop fooling around. Ali relents. 'O.K. He just got a presidential pardon. He can live'." [...] Reuters also commented on this, and more banter between Ali and Mohammad. [...] "Ali is shown making a pretend hostage video with Mohammad, and then teasing his friend for his smelly feet. 'If Chemical Ali really wanted to destroy the north he should have fired a rocket with Mohammad's socks in it'." ...|$|E
