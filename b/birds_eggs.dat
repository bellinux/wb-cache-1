5|$|The {{teeth of}} V.salvadorii do not {{resemble}} those of other monitor species, which are typically blunt, peglike, and face slightly rearward. Their upper teeth are long and fang-like, standing vertical from the jawbone, designed to hook into fast-moving or feathered prey such as birds, bats, and rodents. Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath. In the wild, V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea, feeding on <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs,</b> small mammals, and carrion. Natives have reported that it can take down pigs, deer, and hunting dogs, and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it. Captive specimens {{have been known to}} eat fish, frogs, rodents, chickens, and dog food.|$|E
5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs</b> and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E

Additionally, its pore system is prolatocanaliculate, unlike the angusticanaliculate pores of <b>bird</b> <b>eggs</b> (such as Laevisoolithidae or Gobioolithidae) and its microstructures are much more {{similar to those of}} stalicoolithids, Mosaicoolithus, and Paraspheroolithus.|$|R

25|$|The oncilla is a {{primarily}} terrestrial animal, {{but is also}} an adept climber. Like all cats, the oncilla is an obligate carnivore, requiring {{meat for}} survival. This cat eats small mammals, lizards, <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs,</b> invertebrates, and the occasional tree frog. Occasionally, the cat will eat grasses. The oncilla stalks its prey from a distance, and once in range, it pounces to catch and kill the prey.|$|E
25|$|All snakes are {{strictly}} carnivorous, eating small animals including lizards, frogs, other snakes, small mammals, <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs,</b> fish, snails or insects. Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, they must swallow prey whole. The body {{size of a}} snake has {{a major influence on}} its eating habits. Smaller snakes eat smaller prey. Juvenile pythons might start out feeding on lizards or mice and graduate to small deer or antelope as an adult, for example.|$|E
25|$|The daily diet of the {{ordinary}} ancient Israelite was mainly one of bread, cooked grains, and legumes. Bread was eaten with every meal. Vegetables played a smaller, but {{significant role in the}} diet. The Israelites drank goat and sheep’s milk when it was available in the spring and summer, and ate butter and cheese. Figs and grapes were the fruits most commonly eaten, while dates, pomegranates, and other fruits and nuts were eaten more occasionally. Wine was the most popular beverage and sometimes other fermented beverages were produced. Olives were used primarily for their oil. Meat, usually goat and mutton, was eaten rarely and reserved for special occasions, such as celebrations, festival meals, or sacrificial feasts. Game, <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs</b> and fish were also eaten, depending on availability.|$|E

500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} (Dendroaspis angusticeps), {{also known as}} the common mamba, East African green mamba, green mamba, or white-mouthed mamba, is a large, tree-dwelling, highly venomous snake species of the mamba genus Dendroaspis. This species of mamba was first {{described}} by a Scottish surgeon and zoologist in 1849. This snake mostly inhabits the coastal regions of southern East Africa. Adult females average approximately [...] in length, and males are slightly smaller. Eastern green mambas prey on <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs,</b> bats, and rodents such as mice, rats, and gerbils. They are shy and elusive snakes which are rarely seen, making them somewhat unusual among mambas, and elapids in general. This elusiveness is usually attributed to the species' green colouration which blends with its environment, and its arboreal lifestyle. However, eastern green mambas have also been observed to use [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] or ambush predation like many vipers, unlike the active foraging style typical of other elapids, which may be a factor in the rarity of sightings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fennec fox}} is an omnivore. Food sources include plants, rodents, insects, <b>birds,</b> <b>eggs,</b> and rabbits. An {{individual}} can jump up to [...] high and [...] forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large eared foxes {{such as the}} fennec, or the bat-eared fox, can seem {{to stare at the}} ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground. There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.|$|E

60|$|When {{he entered}} the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It {{was one of those}} spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low {{projecting}} eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored <b>birds</b> <b>eggs</b> were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.|$|E
