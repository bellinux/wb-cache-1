50|$|This {{alliance}} {{was conceived}} {{as part of}} one of various proposals for a Balkan federation, planned as a buffer zone between East and West. Members of the First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> were Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgarian revolutionary committees, the Croatian People's Party, Greece and Romania. The major role in establishing of the First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> was played by Serbia, under Prince Mihailo Obrenović and Prime Minister Ilija Garašanin.|$|E
50|$|The {{establishment}} of the <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> was campaigned by Prince Mihailo Obrenović of Serbia. To establish the First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance,</b> the Principality of Serbia signed a series of contracts in the period 1866-68. The first contract was signed with Montenegro in 1866. The next contracts were signed in autumn of 1866 with the People's Party in Croatia-Slavonia, with the Bulgarian Revolutionary Secret Society in 1867, with Greece in 1867 and with Romania in 1868.|$|E

The establishment of <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliances</b> was supported and aided by Russia because it corresponded with its policy of promoting Balkan unity.|$|R
5000|$|Take or Tache Ionescu ( [...] ; born Dumitru Ghiță Ioan {{and also}} known as Demetriu G. Ionnescu; [...] - [...] June 2, 1922) was a Romanian centrist politician, journalist, lawyer and diplomat, who also enjoyed {{reputation}} as a short story author. Starting his political career as a radical member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), he joined the Conservative Party in 1891, and became noted as a social conservative expressing support for several progressive and nationalist tenets. Ionescu is generally viewed as embodying the rise of middle-class politics inside the early 20th century Kingdom of Romania (occasionally described as Takism), and, throughout the period, promoted a project of <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliances</b> while calling for measures to incorporate the Romanian-inhabited Austro-Hungarian regions of Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina. Representing his own faction inside the Conservative Party, he clashed with the group's leadership in 1907-1908, and consequently created and led his own Conservative-Democratic Party.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, most of the {{territory}} of Balkans was still part of the Ottoman Empire, with several newly established independent or autonomous entities like Serbia and Greece. All of them struggled to expand their influence and territory at Ottoman expense. Their intention was strongly opposed by Austria who opposed development of Balkan nations and revolutions in the Ottoman provinces of Europe (Rumelia). Napoleon III was the champion of the idea of Balkan nationalism and fostered Serbia and Greece to build alliances and undermine Ottoman influence in the region. France planned to resolve the Balkan Eastern Question trough gathering of all Balkan Slavic people, including Bulgarians, around Serbia as their pillar. This was not only informally suggested by French diplomats since 1861, but also formally proposed in Saint Petersburg in 1867.

The next contract was signed in autumn of 1866 with the People's Party in Croatia-Slavonia led by Catholic bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer. This contract was followed by contract with Bulgarian Revolutionary Secret Society in 1867, with Greece in 1867 and with Romania in 1868.|$|E
50|$|<b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> ruler Stefan Lazarević (1389-1427) {{erected a}} marble column with {{inscriptions}} on the field, {{in memory of}} his father. Battle of Kosovo (1448) was fought between the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E
50|$|After {{the murder}} of Prince Mihailo Obrenović in 1868, he was succeeded by his 13-year-old grandnephew Milan Obrenović. Without Mihailo's strong direction, the <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> network collapsed. In the {{following}} years only Montenegro was ready to renew already agreed measures, which resulted with a new alliance agreement in 1876.|$|E
50|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Montenegro in 1910, Montenegro was involved in three wars with the first one being the First <b>Balkan</b> War, in <b>alliance</b> with Serbia, Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria against the Ottoman Empire. The Second Balkan War was fought between Montenegro, Serbia, Greece, Romania and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria, with Bulgaria consequently losing significant territory in the north, Thrace, and Macedonia.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia {{formed a}} Balkan Bloc with Greece, Romania, and Turkey that {{was intent on}} keeping balance on the <b>Balkan</b> peninsula. The <b>alliance</b> was formalized and entrenched on 9 February 1934 when it became the [...] "Balkan Entente". In 1934, with the {{assassination}} of King Alexander I by Vlado Chernozemski in Marseilles and the shifting of Yugoslav foreign policy, the alliance crumbled.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913, Bulgaria found itself isolated on the international scene, surrounded by hostile neighbors and deprived of the support of the Great Powers. Anti-Bulgarian sentiment grew particularly in France and Russia, whose political circles blamed the country for the dissolution of the <b>Balkan</b> League, an <b>alliance</b> of <b>Balkan</b> states directed against the Ottoman Empire. The failure of Bulgarian foreign policy turned revanchism into a focus of Bulgaria's external relations.|$|R
50|$|Kosovo Field is {{a former}} {{battlefield}} northwest from Priština that {{was the site of}} the Battle of Kosovo (1389) between the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> and Ottoman armies. It is for this field, and the battle, that the Kosovo region is named, and in turn the entire Kosovo Vilayet and modern Kosovo. The modern city of Kosovo Polje is also named after the field.|$|E
50|$|Marinović {{later became}} Minister of Finance (1856-1858) and the President of the State Council (1861-1873). Between 1861 and 1867 Marinović was anew the first aide of Prime Minister Ilija Garašanin and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, during their ambitious policy of forming a wider <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> and fomenting a general Christian {{uprising}} against the Ottomans. Marinović {{was sent to}} confidential missions to St. Petersburg, Paris, London and Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|The Second Bulgarian Legion (Втора българска легия) {{was founded}} in 1867, as {{relations}} between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire once again worsened and the Serbian authorities began preparing for war and organizing the First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance.</b> This {{was used by the}} Band of Virtues (Добродетелна дружина), who concluded an agreement with Serbia to establish a Bulgarian military school in Belgrade to instruct military leaders for a future uprising in Bulgaria.|$|E

The same source also says that Emperor Probus, who ruled between 276 and 282, settled Gepid prisoners of wars in the Roman Empire in the Balkans. According to a formal speech, delivered in praise of Emperor Maximian on 1 April 291, the Thervingia Gothic groupjoined [...] "battle with the Vandals and Gepids" [...] around that time.|$|R
25|$|His first {{entry into}} the {{international}} scene was with his {{significant role in the}} autonomy of the Cretan State and later in the union of Crete with Greece. Soon, he was invited to Greece to resolve the political deadlock and became the country's Prime Minister. Not only did he initiate constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society, but also reorganized both army and navy in preparation of future conflicts. Before the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, Venizelos' catalytic role helped gain Greece entrance to the <b>Balkan</b> League, an <b>alliance</b> of the <b>Balkan</b> states against Ottoman Turkey. Through his diplomatic acumen, Greece doubled its area and population with the liberation of Macedonia, Epirus, and most of the Aegean islands.|$|R
50|$|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk {{created a}} radical shift in Turkish {{domestic}} and foreign policy by instituting a strong tradition of secular democracy, which had its roots in the West. Atatürk was an admirer of Enlightenment in many ways and made numerous reforms to modernize Turkey, based on the principles of positivist and rationalist Enlightenment, which he believed would foster educational and scientific progress. In this period, Turkey shifted increasingly towards the West, while culturally and ideologically distancing itself from the conservative mindset, practices and traditions of the Middle East, which were regarded by the Turkish revolutionaries as the source of the backwardness that had caused the Ottoman Empire to collapse. Although Mustafa Kemal Atatürk established a secular, modern country he never formed alliances with Western countries, rather he strengthen relationship with Middle Eastern and Asian countries by forming Treaty of Saadabad, The Baghdad Pact, also forming regional <b>alliance,</b> <b>Balkan</b> Pact.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of 1954 and 1955 Yugoslavia's overtures to the Soviet Union which {{resulted}} in a change of Yugoslav viewregarding the military significance of the Balkan Pact. The visit of Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes to Yugoslavia in May 1955 (only three weeks before Nikita Khrushchev's visit to Josip Broz Tito) showed the difference between the Yugoslav and Turkish estimates of the international situation. Turkish Premier Menderes was interested in the whole field of cooperation within the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance.</b> Yugoslavia was reluctant to take any steps that might appear to give added significance at that time to the military side of the Balkan Pact.|$|E
50|$|The First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> (Први балкански савез/Prvi balkanski savez) was {{a system}} of {{agreements}} concluded by the Principality of Serbia {{in the period of}} 1866-68 to unite the nations of the Balkans in a common struggle against the Ottoman Empire. The plans for forging this alliance were based on the organization of a major general uprising, as opposed to individual uprisings by the various ethnic groups in Ottoman territory. According to the plans, the Albanians would begin the uprising, followed by Serb and Greek volunteers and finally and simultaneously by the regular armies of Serbia and Greece. According to the plans and agreements, after a successful war against the Ottomans, the Balkan nations would establish a united federation.|$|E
50|$|Nazım Pasha {{abandoned}} Goltz Pasha's defensive (and probably realistic) doctrine and, {{though the}} Ottoman army had severe problems in mobilizing its troops (assembling {{fewer than half}} of the expected 600,000 troops), developed a bold offensive plan, including offensive operations on both fronts. Because the Serbian army was, after its defeat in the Serbo-Bulgarian War, considered a weaker opponent even by Western observers, Nazım Pasha planned to attack it first, and render it operationally incapable. He would then attack Bulgaria (which was considered the strongest link in the <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance)</b> from both the Macedonian and Thracian directions. His underestimation of Serbian strength led to the complete failure of his operational plan and the catastrophe which followed.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Mihailo was {{accepted}} back as Prince of Serbia in September 1860, {{after the death}} of his father who had regained the throne in 1858. For the next eight years he ruled as an enlightened absolute monarch. During his second reign the People's Assembly was convened just three times, in 1861, 1864 and 1867. Prince Mihailo's greatest achievement was in persuading the Turkish garrisons to leave Serbia, in 1862 (when the Ottoman Army left the fortresses of Užice and Soko Grad) and 1867 (when the Turks left their fortifications in Belgrade, Šabac, Smederevo and Kladovo). This was done with major diplomatic support from Russia and Austria. In 1866 Mihailo began campaign of forging The First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> by signing the series of agreements with other Balkan entities in period 1866-68.|$|E
50|$|The Ottoman rule in Thessaloniki ended much later, in 1912, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{entered the}} city in {{the last days of the}} First Balkan War. Thessaloniki's status had not been decided by the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> before the war, and Glenny writes that some amongst the city's majority Jewish population at first hoped that the city might be controlled by Bulgaria. Bulgarian control would keep the city at the forefront of a national trade network, while Greek control might affect, for those of certain social classes and across ethnic groups, Thessaloniki's position as the destination of Balkan village trading. After liberation, however, the Greek government won the support of the city's Jewish community, and Greece under Eleftherios Venizelos was one of the first countries to accept the Balfour Declaration, 1917.|$|E
50|$|At first, the principality {{included}} only {{the territory of}} the former Pashaluk of Belgrade, but in 1831-33 it expanded to the east, south, and west. In 1866 Serbia began campaign of forging The First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> by signing the series of agreements with other Balkan entities in period 1866-68. On 18 April 1867 the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from the Belgrade fortress. The only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. A new constitution in 1869 defined Serbia as an independent state. Serbia was further expanded to the southeast in 1878, when its independence from the Ottoman Empire won full international recognition at the Treaty of Berlin. The Principality would last until 1882 when it was raised {{to the level of the}} Kingdom of Serbia.|$|E
50|$|After {{becoming}} Prime Minister in 1911 (he {{held the}} office from June 25, 1911, to June 18, 1912, old style), Milovanović crafted the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance (negotiated with Bulgarian Minister Geshov and monitored by Russian diplomats), signed on March 13, 1912, (February 29, 1912, old style), a key bilateral agreement {{that led to}} the formation of the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> (Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro) against Ottoman Turkey. The provisions of the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance called for a joint action against any power (i.e. Austria-Hungary) that might try to “annex, occupy, or event temporarily to invade with its arms” the Ottoman-held Balkan provinces. A secret annex to the treaty of the alliance considered the contested and non-contested zones in Slavic Macedonia, with the contested zone of northwestern Macedonia (the region between the Šar Mountain and Lake Ohrid) left up to the arbitration of the Russian Emperor, and the uncontested southeastern zone (east of the Lake Ohrd-Kriva Palanka line) intended to become part of Bulgaria, free of any Serbian claims.|$|E
50|$|The talks {{had been}} made {{difficult}} by questions on division of territories: the Greeks sought to establish only the minimum based on the population, equality of origin and historical traditions, whereas Prince Mihailo Obrenović sought the minimum of territory, assuming Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Old Serbia from the Drim to the Iskar. The Greeks, in that case, sought Thessaly, Epirus, and Macedonia between Thessaly and the Sea, Thrace and Balkan Mountains. Finally, the Greek proposal was accepted: Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia, Epirus and Thessaly to Greece. The possibility of a <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> was predicted, {{and the establishment of}} it also as a principle for a national self-determination in the Near East. A special act included the rights of both sides, that if they were unable to realize the minimum of annexations in Article 4 (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Epirus and Thessaly), they would seek compensation in other neighboring provinces of the Ottoman Empire, based on mutual origin of the population.|$|E
50|$|In 1859 {{he tried}} to create a revolutionary {{committee}} in Krusevo. From 1861 he had regular contact with the Russian consuls in Thessaloniki, Istanbul and Bitola - Alexei Lagovski, Alexei Lobanov-Rostovsky and Michail Hitrovo. Vezenkov visited Russia and met with the Russian Emperor Alexander II in the Crimea, where he spent several time and was granted a Russian citizenship. Later Vezenkov {{moved back to the}} Ottoman Empire and established contact with the Serbian diplomatic representative in Istanbul Jovan Ristic. In 1866 during the Greek Cretan uprising the Serbian government, after consultation with Russia, decided to prepare an uprising against the Ottomans and organize the First <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance.</b> With this aim in Albania and Macedonia was sent Stoyan Vezenkov. In 1867 during a trip to Greece for the purchase of a weapons, Stojan was arrested by the authorities. In Nis, he was sentenced to death by hanging, but during the execution the rope tore off. Stojan was reprieved and his sentence was changed to imprisonment for life. His brother Constantine, who at that time was a doctor in Russia, wrote a statement to the Emperor Alexander II. The statement was signed by 50 prominent Russian public figures, dignitaries and relatives of the yard. Alexander II, who personally knew Vezenkov, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan asking for clemency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first great}} battles {{were at the}} Adrianople-Kirk Kilisse {{defensive}} line, where the Bulgarian 1st and 3rd Armies (together 110,000 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (130,000 men) near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The fortress of Adrianople was besieged and Kirk Kilisse was taken without resistance {{under the pressure of}} the Bulgarian Third Army. The initial Bulgarian attack by First and Third Army defeated the Turkish forces, numbering some 130,000, and reached the Sea of Marmara. However, the Turks, with the aid of fresh reinforcements from the Asian provinces, established their third and strongest defensive position at the Chataldja Line, across the peninsula where Constantinople is located. New Turkish forces landed at Bulair and Şarköy, but after heavy fighting they were crushed by the newly formed 4th Bulgarian Army under the command of Gen Stiliyan Kovachev. The offensive at Chataldja failed, too. On 11 March the final Bulgarian assault on Adrianople began. Under the command of Gen. Georgi Vazov the Bulgarians, reinforced with two Serb divisions, conquered the [...] "untakeable" [...] city. On 17/30 May a peace treaty was signed between Turkey and the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance.</b> The First Balkan War, which lasted from October 1912-May 1913, strengthened Bulgaria's position as a regional military power, significantly reduced Ottoman influence over the Balkans and resulted in the formation of an independent Albanian state.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary Bulgarian leaders {{maintained}} friendly {{relations with}} the Serbian government and Serbia {{was regarded as a}} brother state, which was acting as a protector of its Slavic brethren. However, {{in the second half of}} 1866, Serbia failed to contact any serious Bulgarian political party. Nevertheless in 1867, a Bulgarian society, active in Bucharest took the initiative. That was the so called [...] "Benevolent Society". This Society was urged on by the Russian diplomats to approach the Serbian state with a draft-agreement. The document was titled [...] "Programme for Serbo-Bulgarian (Bulgaro-Serbian) political relations and the cordial relationships between them". The Bulgarian side proposed the founding of a Serbo-Bulgarian (Bulgaro-Serbian) dual state, headed by the Serbian Prince. This state was to be named Yugoslav Tsardom and was to have a common government, legislation, army etc. The draft defined also the territories that would constitute Bulgaria as follows: Bulgaria (Moesia), Thrace and Macedonia and per the Serbian newspaper, Vidov Dan (No. 38, March 29, 1862), the Bulgarian-Serbian frontier extended from the Danube in North, along the Timok and South Morava Rivers and then along the Black Drin River to the Lake Ohrid. Garašanin accepted the Bulgarian proposal in a letter from June 1867, but he diplomatically refused to sign the document, fearing how representative this organisation had been. On the other hand, the establishment of the <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> concerned other Bulgarian organisations, which perceived it as an implementation Garašanin's twenty-years old Načertanije.|$|E
50|$|The British {{government}} {{thought it}} best to avoid any complications in the Balkans. The feeling was that a <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> of neutral countries was better suited to its interests, which conflicted with Russian ideas of Bulgarian military support in exchange for territorial concessions by it neighbors. Great Britain was thus unwilling to pressure Bulgaria's neighbors to satisfy Bulgarian territorial demands. In order to further Entente ideas of a Balkan League, the British government dispatched the Liberal MPs Noel and Charles Buxton to meet unofficially with leading Bulgarian statesmen. When they arrived in Bulgaria, the brothers were greeted warmly and first met in September with Tsar Ferdinand, Prime Minister Radoslavov and minister Tonchev, from whom they received firm assurances of Bulgaria's strict neutrality. After that, they {{turned their attention to}} the Bulgarian opposition leaders and met with Aleksandar Stamboliyski, Ivan Geshov, Yanko Sakazov and others. During their stay in the country, the Buxtons found the Bulgarians, even the pro-Entente ones, to be very cautious when it came to aligning the country to Britain. The unofficial character of the visit also made it look like it was a private enterprise rather than one backed by serious British intentions. The brothers however continued their work in Bulgaria and advocated a declaration by the Entente powers promising support for Bulgaria’s claim to the uncontested zone of Macedonia in return for its benevolent neutrality towards Romania and Serbia. Despite having the support of all Allied representatives in Sofia, the Buxtons were unable to impress the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, who considered it out of the question to force Serbia to cede land. Shortly after Noel Buxton was shot and seriously wounded by a Turkish assassin while visiting Bucharest, he and his brother were forced to cease their diplomatic activities temporarily.|$|E
40|$|Tito’s {{visit to}} Greece {{contributed to the}} Balkan Pact’s {{transformation}} into a military alliance. Despite the establishment of Soviet-Yugoslav diplomatic relations in 1953, the Soviet Union made no political move towards normalizing bilateral relations. For security reasons Tito visited Athens (June 1954) to promote Yugoslavia’s military cooperation with Greece and Turkey without ruling out Yugoslavia’s accession to NATO. But the Soviet leadership, fearing Yugoslavia’s involvement in western defense mechanisms, sent the message to Belgrade that it was ready to recognize Stalin’s blunders towards Yugoslavia. Thus, Tito applied a policy of equidistance between East and West and refused to link up the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> with NATO...|$|E
40|$|A subject usually {{neglected}} {{in the historical}} work on Ilija Garašanin’s role as a statesman has been discussed. Attention has been drawn to {{the legal status of}} Serbia at the moment Garašanin entered civil service and how it changed during the thirty years of his political career (1837 – 67). The first part of the paper looks at his views against the background of three vitally important issues for Serbia’s legal status at the time: the constitutional issue, the issue of hereditary succession and the issue of internal independence. His views on the three issues reflect his understanding of the existing status of the Principality of Serbia. The second part of the paper looks at how he envisaged a future Serbian state. Its largest portion is naturally devoted to the ideas put forth in the Načertanije (1844), the first programme of nineteenth-century Serbia’s national and foreign policy. It also looks at Garašanin’s attempt, made through the Serbian representative at the Porte in the revolutionary year 1848, to achieve the reorganization of the Ottoman Empire into a dual monarchy with the Serbian United States (or a Serbian vice-kingdom) as a constituent state. Finally, {{attention has been paid to}} the creation of a <b>Balkan</b> <b>alliance</b> through agreements concluded by Balkan states...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century, the Ottoman Empire was faced with great {{economic}} and political difficulties. The Balkan monarchies would try to use this situation, and the same would do the two antagonist parties, the Russian empire and the group of dualistic monarchy. Those two groups were waiting for the most convenient moment to benefit from the territory of the European Turkey. Even the diplomacies of the Balkan monarchies had intentions of annexing the Albanian and Macedonian territories. 1 In those circumstances, “…, a role with a specific importance had the continuous rebellions in Albania (Luarasi, 1973, 75) ”. This situation was seen as an opportunity for Serbia, for the realization of the project of Ilĳ a Garašanin for the renewal of the medieval state of Stefan Dušan. This project could be realized easier by approximation of the politics of the Balkan monarchies. In these conditions, an alliance between Serbia and Bulgaria was necessary, in order to create optimal conditions for the approximation of politics between Serbia and Bulgaria. This situation was seen as an opportunity even from the Great Powers and Slavic states, which had their long-lasting dreams of expanding their territory. The Great Powers among themselves were in antipodal positions. Each of them aimed at extending the hegemony in Balkans. Main objective of this article is the analysis of the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> after WWI...|$|E
40|$|European-imposed {{reforms in}} Ottoman-held Macedonia {{in the period}} 1904 - 1908 led to the {{diminution}} of Ottoman authority, the encouragement of Christian partisan activities and the consolidation of the Young Turk movement in the region. The Young Turk revolution of 1908 established a Constitutional and Parliamentary regime in the Ottoman Empire pledging institutional reform, equality and liberty for all nationalities. Between July 1908 and April 1909, {{it became clear that}} the Young Turk policies and the Macedonian aspirations of the Christian Balkan countries were incompatible. The Young Turks remained a predominantly Moslem movement committed to safeguard the territorial integrity of the Empire, prevent foreign interference in Ottoman affairs and counteract Christian Macedonian separatism. By contrast, following the withdrawal of European control from Macedonia, the Balkan Christians attempted to take advantage of the Ottoman Constitutional change to further their own political and national interests in Macedonia. Disillusioned by the Young Turk centralist tendencies and apprehensive of a resurgent Turkish nationalism, Bulgarian, Greek and Serb nationalists resorted -once more- to their original means of Macedonian propaganda: religious, cultural and revolutionary activity. During 1909 - 1912, the Committee of Union and Progress (C. U. P.) -the driving force in the Young Turk movement- initiated a policy of enforced denationalization on the non-Moslem ethnic groups. Implemented in a harsh manner in Macedonia, this practice irrevocably undermined any prospect of cooperation between Moslem Young Turks and Christian Macedonians. Its aftermath included the growth of the Albanian nationalist movement and the encouragement of rapprochement between the Christian Balkan states, which was to bring about the establishment of the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the collapse of European Turkey in the Balkan wars...|$|E
