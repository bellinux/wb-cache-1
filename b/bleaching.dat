5|$|For centuries, {{textiles}} and related trades {{were the main}} source of employment in the town. <b>Bleaching</b> was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical <b>bleaching,</b> <b>bleaching</b> fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25bleachers around Salford, most {{to the west of the}} township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham. As its cotton spinning industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other {{textiles and}} to the finishing trades, including rexine and silk dyeing, and fulling and <b>bleaching,</b> at a string of works in Salford.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSmall <b>bleaches</b> {{were used}} to study the {{rhodopsin}} regeneration process. At <b>bleaches</b> from 5. 2 % to 24. 7 %, the rhodopsin regenerations were consistent with a one-for-one recovery of <b>bleached</b> molecules. At response saturation rod photoreceptors exhibit a <b>bleach</b> level of only 5 %. Major increases in rhodopsin regeneration were observed at <b>bleach</b> levels between 1. 3 % and 5. 2 %. The rhodopsin regenerations exhibited a linear relationship that was 4 -times the <b>bleach</b> (dark adaptations of 0. 75 and 1. 5 h). The data show that the <b>bleach</b> initiates the availability, and possibly production, of 11 -cis retinal in amounts that are 4 -times the number of <b>bleached</b> molecules within the functional range of the rod photoreceptors. Rhodopsin regeneration also requires the presence of opsins without chromophore. Regenerations beyond the <b>bleach</b> indicate the presence of such opsins prior to the <b>bleach.</b> The opsin amounts were 8. 1 %, 8. 6 %, 3. 1 % and 0 % of the total visual pigment at dark adaptation times of 0. 75, 1. 5, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Those opsins, {{as well as the}} ones produced by the <b>bleach,</b> may be regenerated to rhodopsin following a small <b>bleach</b> or with additional time in the dark...|$|R

5|$|Jackson's {{skin was}} a medium-brown color {{throughout}} his youth; however, {{starting in the}} mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler, which was partly due to vitiligo, but also widely considered {{to be due to}} skin <b>bleaching</b> and changing of his features to appear white. According to Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, in 1984, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, which Taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by <b>bleaching</b> chemicals over the years. However, vitiligo is a rare non-contagious disease; the causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental factors are suspected {{to play a role in}} this disease. Between 1% and 2% of the world population is considered to be affected. The depigmentation occurs in patches and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.|$|E

Household <b>bleach</b> is a chemically-combined oxidizing agent {{that is used to}} remove or lighten color. Clorox <b>bleach</b> is derived from sodium chloride - common table salt. Clorox produces household <b>bleach</b> by bubbling chlorine into a solution of water and sodium hydroxide. During this process, the chlorine is converted to a sodium hypochlorite solution. The ingredients in Clorox <b>bleach</b> are water, sodium hypochlorite (used to whiten and kill bacteria), sodium chloride, sodium carbonate (removes alcohol and grease stains), sodium chlorate, sodium hydroxide (removes soils that are fatty, oily, or acidic), and sodium polyacrylate.|$|R

5|$|While {{stalling}} {{over the}} western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local coral reefs. Later, the storm's immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases occurring within the coral.

5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing.

Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show <b>bleaching</b> as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like <b>bleaching</b> powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E

50|$|After chlorine-based <b>bleaches,</b> the {{peroxide}} <b>bleaches</b> {{are most}} commonly encountered. Peroxides are compounds that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond, O-O. This {{is a fairly}} weak bond so reactions of peroxides often involve breaking this bond, giving very reactive oxygen species. Most peroxide <b>bleaches</b> are adducts of hydrogen peroxide. They contain hydrogen peroxide, HOOH in combination with another material like sodium carbonate or urea. An exception is sodium perborate, which has a cyclic structure containing two O-O single bonds. All peroxide-based <b>bleaches</b> release hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water. Peroxide <b>bleaches</b> are often used with catalysts and activators, e.g., tetraacetylethylenediamine or sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate.|$|R
5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite <b>bleaching</b> agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become increasingly common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral <b>bleaching</b> event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral <b>bleaching,</b> because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E

5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin <b>bleaching.</b>|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the <b>bleaching</b> of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bleach</b> {{digestion}} of sputum {{prior to}} smear preparation {{has been reported}} to increase the yield of microscopy for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, even in high-HIV-prevalence settings. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of <b>bleach</b> microscopy, we updated a systematic review published in 2006 and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to rate the overall quality of the evidence. We searched multiple databases (as of January 2009) for primary studies in all languages comparing <b>bleach</b> and direct microscopy. We assessed study quality using a validated tool and heterogeneity by standard methods. We used hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) analysis to calculate summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy and random-effects meta-analysis to pool sensitivity and specificity differences. Of 14 studies (11 papers) included, 9 evaluated <b>bleach</b> centrifugation and 5 evaluated <b>bleach</b> sedimentation. Overall, examination of bleach-processed versus direct smears led to small increases in sensitivity (for <b>bleach</b> centrifugation, 6 % [95 % confidence interval {CI} = 3 to 10 %, P = 0. 001]; for <b>bleach</b> sedimentation, 9 % [95 % CI = 4 to 14 %, P = 0. 001]) and small decreases in specificity (for <b>bleach</b> centrifugation, − 3 % [95 % CI = − 4 % to − 1 %, P = 0. 004]; for <b>bleach</b> sedimentation, − 2 % [95 % CI = − 5 % to 0 %, P = 0. 05]). Similarly, analysis of HSROC curves suggested little or no improvement in diagnostic accuracy. The quality of evidence was rated very low for both <b>bleach</b> centrifugation and <b>bleach</b> sedimentation. This updated systematic review suggests that the benefits of <b>bleach</b> processing are less than those described previously. Further research should focus on alternative approaches to optimizing smear microscopy, such as light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy and same-day sputum collection strategies...|$|R
