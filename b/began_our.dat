[...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who could so well as she see the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do you suppose was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E

Prchal closed the four throttles and warned the others through the intercom [...] "Attention, crash". The aircraft crashed into the sea.|$|E

They also ignore {{the responsibility of the}} relevant parties under international law to conduct prompt, thorough, effective and independent investigations. We regret the personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure placed on members of the fact-finding mission since we <b>began</b> <b>our</b> work in May 2009. This campaign has been clearly aimed at undermining the integrity of the report and its authors. Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitise our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade.|$|E
