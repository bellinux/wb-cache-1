5|$|England and MCC captain Norman Yardley later {{admitted}} Barnes's close proximity {{throughout the season}} had a psychological effect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> close {{to react to the}} oncoming ball.|$|E
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Ezeh {{was unable}} to play {{football}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> big for the local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, {{even though he was}} not the primary weapon in the backfield. Ezeh was {{also a member of the}} Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy {{where he had}} his hands full trying to calm unpaid soldiers {{who were on the}} verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E
5|$|Red Cloud {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army in 1948. After the Korean War began in June 1950, {{he was sent to}} Korea with the 19th Infantry, 24th Infantry Division, which was among the American troops who fought the first battles of the war, being pushed back during the Battle of Taejon and the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. The 19th Infantry also was part of the Eighth United States Army advance into North Korea. On the night of 5 November 1950, Red Cloud was manning a forward {{observation}} post when he spotted an imminent surprise attack by Chinese forces. Red Cloud single-handedly held off the Chinese forces despite being shot eight times, at one point ordering his men to tie him to a tree <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> weak to stand by himself. His company found him the next morning, surrounded by dead Chinese troops. He was credited with alerting his company to the ambush and saving them from being overrun. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
25|$|Tongan {{males were}} often heavily tattooed. In Captain Cook's time only the Tui Tonga (king) was not: <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> high ranked {{for anybody to}} touch him. Later it became the habit that a young Tui Tonga went to Samoa to be tattooed there.|$|E

50|$|A Jimmy Fallon sketch. Debuted November 2, 2002. Fallon plays Joey Mack, an obnoxious radio DJ who {{has special}} guests on his show, but almost never lets them talk on air <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> preoccupied {{with his own}} comic voices.|$|R

25|$|He {{grew up in}} the Louisianan {{towns of}} Gilbert and Waterproof. He began misrepresenting his year of birth as either 1889 or 1890, {{possibly}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young to attend college after he graduated from high school, so his father added three years to his age.|$|E
25|$|Several Republican leaders {{narrowly}} avoided execution. Ernie O'Malley, {{captured on}} 4 November 1922, was not executed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> badly wounded when taken prisoner {{to face a}} court martial and possibly because the Free State was hesitant about executing an undisputed hero of the recent struggle against the British. Liam Deasy, captured in January 1923 avoided execution by signing a surrender document calling on the Anti-Treaty forces {{to lay down their}} arms.|$|E
25|$|After {{the wars}} were over, Kamo {{worked in the}} Soviet Customs office, by some {{accounts}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> unstable {{to work for the}} secret police. Kamo died in a 1922 road accident when a truck hit him while he was cycling. The incident is widely believed to be a political murder ordered by Stalin. Immediately after Kamo died, Stalin sent someone to collect all of Kamo's records and papers so that they would not embarrass Stalin.|$|E

25|$|To {{play the}} {{physical}} role of Howard, Huyck and Katz held casting calls with dwarf actors, eventually casting a child actor and hiring Ed Gale, {{who had been}} rejected <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> tall for the role, to perform stunts and portray the role during evening shoots. The child actor found the shooting conditions to be too difficult to handle, and the film's editors were unable to match day and evening sequences because {{of the difference in}} the two portrayals. Because Gale also served as an understudy, he took over the role.|$|E
25|$|He {{was engaged}} by the Oxford Players, {{where he worked}} {{with the likes of}} John Gielgud and Robert Morley. Ironically, as Napier recalled, height played a crucial part in his {{securing}} the position and also almost losing it. J. B. Fagan had dismissed Tyrone Guthrie <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> tall for most parts. Napier was interviewed (and accepted) as Guthrie's replacement while sitting down. Fagan realized that Napier was even taller than Guthrie when he stood up, but honoured his commitment. Napier performed for ten years (1929–1939) on the West End stage.|$|E
25|$|Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, {{just before}} he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his {{military}} service, Wilson returned {{to live with his}} wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> drunk to pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation.|$|E

25|$|Higgins {{was raised}} in the Church Of Ireland religion. He started playing snooker at the age of 11, often in the Jampot club in his native Sandy Row area of south Belfast and later in the YMCA in the nearby city centre. At age 14, he left for England and a career as a jockey. However, he never made the grade <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> heavy to ride competitively. He {{returned}} to Belfast and by 1965, aged 16, he had compiled his first maximum break. In 1968 he won the All-Ireland and Northern Ireland Amateur Snooker Championships.|$|E
25|$|After {{only a few}} matches, Colley was {{replaced}} with Barry Darsow in a match aired on the February 14, 1987 edition of Superstars. In an RF Video shoot interview with Eadie and Darsow, Eadie said that Colley {{was replaced}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> recognizable to the fans {{as the man who}} previously performed as Moondog Rex. The WWF pitched a few potential replacements to Eadie, but he thought fans would recognize the suggested replacements. However, Eadie felt that many WWF fans would not recognize Darsow, who had been working for Jim Crockett Promotions as Krusher Khruschev alongside Nikita Koloff. Darsow had left Crockett following a dispute in order to take over the role of Smash.|$|E
25|$|Arbore {{was also}} {{integrated}} on the Boyar Council in 1486, but only returned there in 1498, possibly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> often {{absent from the}} country on diplomatic assignments. According to historian Virgil Pâslariuc, he was co-opted there because he supported Stephen's co-ruler and designated successor, Bogdan III, whose claim to the throne was contested by his brothers; and also {{because he was a}} distinguished warrior. During the final years of Stephen III's reign, Arbore and Ioan Tăutu became increasingly influential, taking on more and more attributes; by 1503, Arbore had also risen through the Boyar Council, being listed there as the eighth most important boyar. For a while, he was the country's spatharios, or military commander.|$|E
50|$|A match usually {{consists}} of a fixed, odd number of frames. A frame begins with setting up the balls as described above.

25|$|Eagle {{from the}} Light, (Tipiyelehne Ka Awpo) {{chief of the}} non-treaty Lam'tama band, that {{traveled}} east over the Bitterroot Mountains along with Looking Glass' band to hunt buffalo, {{was present at the}} Walla Walla Council in 1855 and supported the non-treaty faction at the Lapwai Council, refused to sign the Treaty of 1855 and 1866, left his territory on Salmon River (two miles south of Corvallis) in 1875 with part of his band, and did settle down in Weiser County (Montana), joined with Shoshone Chief's Eagle's Eye. The leadership of the other Lam'tama that rested on the Salmon River was taken by old chief White Bird. Eagle From the Light didn't participate in the War of 1877 <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> far away.|$|E
25|$|Ørsted Pedersen {{was born}} in Osted, near Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, {{the son of a}} church organist.

By the age of fifteen, he had the ability to accompany leading musicians at nightclubs, working regularly at Copenhagen's Jazzhus Montmartre, after his debut there on New Year's Eve 1961, when he was only 15. When seventeen, he had already turned down an offer to join the Count Basie orchestra, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Pope Shenouda III died on 17 March 2012 (8 Paremhat 1728 in the Coptic calendar) of {{lung and}} liver {{complications}} at his official residence shortly {{after returning from}} medical treatment abroad.

However, Al Jazeera English's Coptic Egyptian reporter Sherine Tadros {{reported that he had}} been in good spirits prior to his death. The funeral took place after three days of lying in state; on 20 March, he was buried at the Monastery of Saint Pishoy in Wadi el-Natrun, in accordance with his wishes. Metropolitan Pachomious of Beheira and Pentapolis was appointed to take over papal duties until the election of a new Pope, being the second-most senior Metropolitan in the Holy Synod in age after Anba Mikhail, but due to his failing health and age delegated this duty to Metropolitan Pachomios during the first meeting of the Holy Synod after Shenouda's death.|$|E
