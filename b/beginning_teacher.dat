The combined impact of poverty, race, and urbanicity has a substantial effect on the probability that a district has a critically high percentage of <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers.</b> A high percentage of <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers</b> likely reflects higher teacher turnover in the district, and could suggest issues of teacher quality.

40|$|Master of EducationThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the induction of <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers</b> into Catholic secondary schools in Victoria. The study examines formal induction processes, the role of the induction program within the school, and the advisability of the appointment of induction mentors. Current literature on the induction of <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers</b> was examined and wherever possible reference was made to literature originating from Australian and Victorian sources. A group of twenty-five (25) <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers</b> was surveyed in order to identify the problems that members were facing and to clarify the extent to which formal induction programs operated in their schools. The survey results reveal that nearly all of the <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers</b> experienced some difficulties and problems in their first few months of teaching. However, only a small majority {{of the respondents indicated that}} formal induction programs existed in their schools. Presently there is no firm policy requiring that all Victorian Catholic secondary schools implement formal induction programs for <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers.</b> However, the Catholic Education Office of Victoria has recommended that administrators in Catholic secondary schools establish induction programs for <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers.</b> The study proposes a number of recommendations to ensure a more consistent approach to the formal induction of <b>beginning</b> <b>teachers.</b> It suggests that a formal policy be developed and endorsed by Catholic secondary schools throughout Victoria in conjunction with the Catholic Education Office.
