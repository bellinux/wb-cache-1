60|$|The {{worst that}} came to pass in 1918, from an angler's viewpoint, was that the market {{fishermen}} {{found a way to}} net the <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna,</b> both large and small. All I could learn was that the nets were lengthened and deepened. The Japs got into the great schools of large tuna which appeared off Anacapa Island and netted tons and tons of hundred-pound tuna. These schools drifted on {{down the middle of the}} Clemente Channel, and I was the lucky fellow who happened to get among them for one memorable day.|$|E
60|$|The {{summer of}} 1917 {{will never be}} {{forgotten}} by those fishermen who were fortunate enough to be at Avalon. Early in June, even in May, there were indications that the first record season in many years might be expected. Barracuda and white sea-bass showed up in great schools; the ocean appeared {{to be full of}} albacore; yellowtail began to strike all along the island shores and even in the bay of Avalon; almost every day in July sight of broadbill swordfish was reported, sometimes as many as ten in a day; in August the <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> surged in, school after school, in vast numbers; and in September returned the Marlin, or roundbill swordfish that royal-purple swashbuckler of the Pacific.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the tip of}} West End, {{the water}} {{on the south side}} of the island drops to a deep trench not far from the shoreline. The Gulf Stream runs through this trench, {{attracting}} big game fish to the smaller prey that are carried along. Offshore sport fishermen are drawn to the blue marlin, white marlin, yellow-fin and <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna,</b> sailfish, wahoo and dolphin (Mahi Mahi).|$|E
50|$|The {{sea life}} of the bay is quite varied and healthy. Fish such as Flounder, <b>Blue-Finned</b> <b>Tuna,</b> Sand Eel and Striped Bass all call the bay home. Sea mammals are also quite common in Cape Cod Bay such as seals, {{dolphins}} and whales.|$|R
50|$|The {{steep sides}} of the plateau cause deep-water {{currents}} to rise up {{when they hit the}} bank; this upwelling brings with it nutrients and minerals from the bottom, feeding the local ecosystem. Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, silver hake, yellow-tail flounder, <b>blue-fin</b> and yellow-fin <b>tuna,</b> striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the American lobster, sea scallops, squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of seals (harp seal, gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|R
5000|$|Hagen Stehr {{through his}} company Clean Seas Tuna has {{invested}} in attempts to close {{the life cycle of}} the Southern <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> by propagating them in a land-based tank. The tank's waters were climatically controlled to simulate the experience of wild fish traversing long distances and varied oceanic conditions. The mature fish required for the research were air-lifted to the facility from grow-out pens at sea by helicopter. The research was conducted in partnership with Kinki University, Japan and over the first four and a half years, $4.5 million was raised through government bodies. The Fisheries Research & Development Corporation (FRDC) and the Government of South Australia's Department of Trade & Economic Development (now the Department of State Development) were among them.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{aquaculture}} is {{a diverse}} industry {{with a number}} of different culture systems, depending on the location of the operation (subtidal or intertidal) and the species being grown. As a result, the nature and potential for environmental impact can vary greatly. If the aquaculture farm is sited and operated appropriately, the environmental impact can be minimal. For the purposes of this environmental assessment guide, aquaculture is defined as the propagation or rearing of molluscs or finfish in marine waters. When a marine aquaculture proposal does not fall into this definition (e. g. aquaculture on land using seawater) it may require a referral to the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) under Schedule 22 (5) (2) of the Development Regulations 1993. The types of production facilities and examples of the fish that are commonly grown in them include: • sea cages – southern <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna,</b> yellowtail kingfish, mulloway, snapper, and abalone • racks – Pacific oyster...|$|E
40|$|An intensifying {{and ever}} {{widening}} {{range of human}} activity occurs in the area south of the Antarctic Convergence. Amongst its various consequences {{it is reasonable to}} see increasing environmental pressures. Whilst not all activity occurring here is subject to particular international legal instruments, most is. A cluster of Antarctic-specific instruments, comprising the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, 1972 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS), 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol), form what is termed ‘the Antarctic Treaty System’ (ATS) and address a large part of present activity. Whaling and harvesting of Southern <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> are regulated under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) through its International Whaling Commission (IWC), and the 1993 Convention for the Conservation of Southern <b>Blue-fin</b> <b>Tuna</b> (CCSBT) through its Commission respectively, legal instruments that are external to the Antarctic Treaty System. Other high seas activities in the region are subject to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Modern integrated environmental management approaches are largely confined to only two of these six instruments - CCAMLR and the Protocol. The obligation for prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), one of the major tools deployed in modern environmental management globally, is confined to the latter. EIA obligations in the Protocol are coupled with the advance notice obligations of Article VII. 5. a of the Antarctic Treaty. Although EIA has been applied to national Antarctic programmes and tourism activities, as a matter of state practice this has (drawing on a number of considerations) generally excluded EIA application to any whaling or fishing activities (although there are exceptions in relation to one state). States active in the region, whatever their positions on whaling and the modalities of other marine harvesting, have generally resisted calls to broaden the range of activities subject to EIA. This paper documents the basis for EIA within the Antarctic Treaty System, examines the arguments that have been used to deny its applicability to the wider range of Antarctic activities, enquires into the exceptions, considers the place of EIA {{in the context of the}} declaratory positions of Antarctic-active states in relation to ecosystem maintenance and environmental and other use values, and suggests mechanisms whereby some broadening of EIA coverage might be achieved if the political will existed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of {{fallowing}} of southern <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> farms in southern Spencer Gulf, South Australia, on macrobenthic assemblage comparing spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance at eight control sites and eight fallowed pontoon sites, during the period October 2002 to October 2003. Two stations at each site were sampled five times throughout the year with four replicates. Polychaetes were the most abundant organisms both at control sites (76. 4 %) and fallowed pontoon sites (80. 5 %). Five dominant taxa (Capitellidae, Cirratullidae, Lumbrineridae, Nephtyidae, and Spionidae), relatively tolerant to organic enrichment, were generally recorded in higher numbers at the fallowed sites than at control sites. Assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses, a significant difference in abundance between the control and fallowed pontoon sites was found, which also showed a significant effect of time. A slight decreased in diversity, number of taxa, and evenness at fallowed pontoon sites compared to those at control sites was observed. Seasonal fluctuations caused by natural variability, especially hydrodynamic conditions and sediment characteristics, are likely to be responsible for the observed changes of the assemblages...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Objective This {{study is}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of multivariate analyses and distributional/ graphical techniques in assessing the response of macrobenthic assemblages to environmental disturbance caused by fish farming, comparing temperate and tropical regions. Methods The biotic datas were used from samples taken under southern <b>blue-fin</b> <b>tuna</b> farms in southern Spencer Gulf, South Australia, and under floating net cage at Rawapening Lake, and under fish impoundment at coastal region of Demak District, Central Java, Indonesia. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) were used for analysis the abiotic and biotic datas, respectively. Abundance-Biomass Comparison (ABC) curves were employed to detect the level of disturbance. Results The {{results showed that the}} use of multivariate analyses and distributional/graphical techniques are effective to assess the severity of disturbance, owing to sensitive response of macrobenthic assemblages to environmental disturbance that made it possible to detect effects of farming activities. The ordination of MDS and ABC curves showed consistently with Wstatistic and H’ index values in assessing the status of the area in that both tropical and temperate regions. They clearly separated the disturbed and undisturbed areas, whether in spatial and temporal, thus the methods may be applied at temperate and tropical regions. Conclusion Seasonal fluctuations caused by natural variability, hydrodynamic conditions, sediment characteristics, and organic matter are likely to be responsible for the observed changes of the assemblages over the study period. The use of multivariate analyses and distributional/graphical techniques are effective to assess the severity of disturbance, owing to sensitive response of macrobenthic assemblages to environmental disturbance that made it possible to detect effects of farming activities...|$|E
