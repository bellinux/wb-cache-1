25|$|After {{creating}} Yūko, Clamp {{believed her}} character was so interesting {{she could be}} the only main character in the series. However, they then wondered it would more interesting if they created another character who, like Yūko, would also be connected with the spirits and across the story would see Yūko's life and often ask her about the supernatural events. They compared Yūko and Watanuki with Doraemon and Nobita Nobi, respectively, from the manga series Doraemon. Unlike Yūko, Watanuki's personality and design were not difficult to write and illustrate. He {{was based on a}} real <b>beautician</b> who has not been identified by the authors.|$|E
25|$|When {{making the}} {{character}} Clamp thought three patterns of conduct for her. The character was not fully decided until meeting her model.

However, there are no physical similarities between Yūko and her model. The artists had problems in designing the character, as it took them a long time to make her facial expressions. In choosing Sayaka Ohara as Yūko's Japanese voice actress, Clamp made a research to find a voice actress who was not heavily associated with another character. In the English dubbed series, she is voiced by and Colleen Clinkenbeard in English.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of Chocolat, Binoche was internationally {{recognized}} as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series of period roles portraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation. Keen to try something new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy <b>beautician</b> in Jet Lag opposite Jean Reno. The film, directed by Daniele Thompson, was a box-office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress. The film {{tells the story of}} a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolates Ferrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon her Chocolat persona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.|$|E
25|$|Linda Melson Harrison {{was born}} in Berlin, Maryland. She was the third of five daughters of Isaac Burbage Harrison (1907–1989), a nurseryman, and his wife, Ida Virginia Melson (1914–2010), a <b>beautician.</b> She was the middle child, with two older sisters, Kay and Gloria, and two younger sisters, Jane and Joan. The Harrisons, like Linda's {{maternal}} Melson ancestors, {{had a long history}} in the Delmarva region. According to Ancestry.com, the Melson family were mid-17th century immigrants to Maryland from Melsonby St James in North Yorkshire. The Anglo-Welsh Harrisons had been resident for generations in West Kirby, Cheshire, when one Richard Harrison (1593–1653), son of another Richard Harrison (1559–1617), emigrated in the early 17th century from West Kirby to the New Haven Colony in what is now Connecticut, thence to Maryland. Richard's direct descendant, Harrison's paternal grandfather, Joseph G. Harrison, and Joseph's older brother, Orlando Harrison (Mayor of Berlin 1900–1910 and 1916–1918 and senator from Maryland), established , which were, at one time, the largest fruit tree nursery business in America, employing some five hundred workers. The Harrison Lab at the University of Maryland, College Park campus, which Harrison attended briefly, was named for her paternal great-uncle, Senator Orlando Harrison.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the African-Americans in {{business}} were men, however women {{played a major}} role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. <b>Beauticians</b> could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black <b>beauticians</b> were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, <b>beauticians</b> offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful {{in the context of their}} own community because, [...] "Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization." [...] Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Background. Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} due to acrylates {{present in the}} workplace is a disease frequently reported among dentists, printers, and fiberglass workers. Recently, {{the number of cases}} of contact allergic dermatitis among <b>beauticians</b> specialized in sculpting artificial nails has increased. Objective. Our objective was to study the clinical characteristics and allergens implicated in allergic {{contact dermatitis}} due to acrylates in <b>beauticians</b> and users of sculpted nails. Material and methods. This was an observational, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates used in sculpting artificial nails over the last 26 years in the Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain. Results. In total, 15 patients were diagnosed: 14 <b>beauticians</b> and 1 client. Most cases were diagnosed in the past 2 years. All were women, their mean age was 32. 2 years, and 26. 7 % had a personal or family history of atopy. The sensitization time varied between 1 month and 15 years. The most frequently affected areas were the fleshy parts of the fingers and hands. Three patients — 2 <b>beauticians</b> and 1 client — presented allergic asthma due to acrylates. All patients underwent patch testing with a standard battery of allergens and a battery of acrylates. The most frequent allergens were ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (13 / 15, 86. 7 %), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (13 / 15, 86. 7 %), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (7 / 15, 46. 7 %), 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate (5 / 15, 33. 3 %), and methyl methacrylate (5 / 15, 33. 3 %). Conclusions. Acrylate monomers used for sculpting artificial nails are important sensitizers for contact and occupational dermatitis. The most important consideration is primary and secondary prevention...|$|R
