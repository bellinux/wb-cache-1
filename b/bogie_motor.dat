50|$|In 1928-30 {{the cars}} were {{converted}} to use electro-pneumatic brakes and the formation changed to 7-cars DM-T-T-SM-CT-T-DM, the SM cars having only one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie.</b> After 1938 guard control air-operated doors were installed and a control trailer <b>bogie</b> <b>motored</b> with equipment from the recently scrapped electric locomotives. The formation was DM-T-T-SM-SM-T-T-DM.|$|R
50|$|The 70000 series {{trains are}} formed as seven-car sets as shown below, with car 1 at the {{northern}} end. Each car is motored, with only the outer axle on each <b>bogie</b> <b>motored.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Conversion of {{one former}} trailer car (car 3) to a motored car, and the {{addition}} of a second <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> to car 9, which previously only had one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also in 1982 BB15056 {{received}} a bimotor <b>bogie</b> with <b>motors</b> {{similar to the}} ones used in TGV Sud-Est sets.|$|R

40|$|Within the {{research}} project High Efficiency <b>Motor</b> <b>Bogie</b> for Modern Trains (HEMBOT), {{a new light}} weight <b>motor</b> <b>bogie</b> has been developed by introducing the latest development technologies and modern light weight materials in a simultaneous approach by component suppliers, research institutes, system integrators and operators. As a result the capabilities and potentials of this development were demonstrated on prototypes by extensive testing in a real locomotive...|$|R
5000|$|From 2016, {{the entire}} fleet of 19 two-car {{trainsets}} {{is scheduled to}} undergo refurbishment, {{and at the same}} time reclassified [...] "7200 series". Refurbishment includes replacement of the DC motors with 140 kW AC motors and VVVF control, new side windows, new [...] "efWing" [...] CFRP <b>bogies</b> (S-DT67ef <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> and S-TR67ef trailer bogies), and a new livery based on the original style with a thin green line added to the magenta bodyside stripe. Internally, the refurbished trains have fixed four-person seating bays on one side with longitudinal bench seating on the other.|$|R
2500|$|Kleven {{recommended}} {{that there be}} ordered 28 trams and 17 trailers, but this was later reduced by two trailers. [...] Costs could be reduced since the <b>bogies,</b> <b>motors,</b> transformers and compressors from the fire could be salvaged, and reused by the new trams. [...] Final decision would {{be taken by the}} city council, since Trondheim Sporvei was a municipal agency. [...] The chief of administration recommended 24 October that only the 8 million from the insurance be used for new stock, but also said that NOK 4 million could be borrowed. [...] On 1 November, the city council voted in favor of the suggestion, giving the tram company's board freedom to strike the deal.|$|R
50|$|The trains use bolsterless bogies {{developed}} from those used on earlier E259 series and E657 series trains. <b>Motored</b> <b>bogies</b> with capability for retrofitting anti-oscillation equipment (rear bogies on car 1 and 3) are designated DT81, <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> equipped anti-roll devices (cars 2, 5, 7, and 10) are designated DT82, and <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> not equipped with either (cars 6 and 11) are designated DT81A. Non-powered (trailer) bogies are designated TR265, and {{are equipped with}} a parking brake and capability for retrofitting anti-oscillation equipment, but those not equipped with a parking brake (rear bogies on cars 4 and 14, and both bogies on car 9) are designated TR265A, and those on car 8, which not equipped with either are designated TR265B.|$|R
50|$|Both types use {{the same}} bogies as the 701 series EMUs: DT61A <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR246A trailer bogies.|$|R
50|$|During rebuilding, all <b>bogies</b> and {{traction}} <b>motors</b> {{underwent a}} complete refurbishment. Traction motors were tested back-to-back to ensure quality.|$|R
50|$|Each car has one DT75B <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> (at the Sendai end) and one TR260B trailer bogie (at the Sekimaki end).|$|R
50|$|The {{trains are}} formed of eight cars formed as follows, with all cars motored (only one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> per car).|$|R
5000|$|Alstom Citadis 302 tramways {{have one}} motor [...] "car", one suspended, one with <b>bogie</b> but without <b>motors,</b> one suspended, one motor.|$|R
50|$|Vivarail is an English {{rolling stock}} manufacturer, founded in 2012 and based in Stratford-upon-Avon. Vivarail's main {{project is the}} {{conversion}} of bodyshells, <b>bogies</b> and <b>motors</b> from retired London Underground D78 Stock into the Class 230. Lead by former Chiltern Railways chairman Adrian Shooter, Railroad Development Corporation is a shareholder.|$|R
50|$|The two-car {{sets are}} {{numbered}} S01 onward, and are formed {{as shown below}} with both cars <b>motored</b> (one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> per car).|$|R
50|$|A {{proposal}} {{to replace the}} tramway with trolleybus was discarded by the city council. The depot was rebuilt, and 28 new Class 7 trams were ordered, in addition to 15 trailers from Strømmens Værksted and Hønefoss Karosserifabrikk, respectively. The <b>bogies</b> and <b>motors</b> were salvaged, and reused on the new trams.|$|R
50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on a TR255D non-powered trailer bogie at the outer end, and a DT79 <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> at the inner end.|$|R
50|$|The three-car {{sets are}} {{numbered}} A01 onward, and are formed {{as shown below}} with all three cars <b>motored</b> (one <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> per car).|$|R
50|$|The trains run on bolsterless bogies {{with full}} active suspension. The <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> are {{designated}} KD-320, and the trailer bogies are designated KD-320A.|$|R

50|$|During the {{delivery}} of the first batch in 2011, the Prague transport company started negotiations with Škoda regarding the installation of air conditioning in the passenger compartment. It also raised the concern that a 1000 horsepower streetcar may be unnecessarily powerful and proposed a solution used in the Riga version, which has only {{three out of four}} bogies driven. In the view of the transport company the price of additional air conditioning should be covered by eliminating the first <b>bogie's</b> <b>motors.</b> As of May 2011, it was not yet decided whether this solution will be applied. Firstly there is issue that participants in the original tender may contest the change and require a new competition; secondly it has to be tested whether the 15T without full adhesion would be able to drive on Prague's hilly network.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{locomotive}} was derived from Be 4/6 12302, particularly the first batch, numbers 12303 to 12312. Traction was provided by two electric motors, one mounted in each <b>bogie.</b> The <b>motors</b> drove two drive axles. Each bogie also had an unpowered running axle. Wheels had between 2 and 70 mm play with the bogie frame.|$|R
50|$|When John Aspinall was {{appointed}} General Manager, Hoy became Chief Mechanical Engineer. His principal contribution was {{the design of}} an electrification system for the Liverpool to Southport line, including <b>motor</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 14-car set {{was mounted}} on a total of 16 bogies: four TR257 trailer bogies (cars 1, 7, 8, 14), six TR258 shared trailer bogies, and six DT73 shared <b>motor</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1963 {{the first}} of 25 general purpose {{diesel-electric}} locomotives was delivered by Clyde Engineering. As a cost saving measure, they were built with <b>bogies</b> and <b>motors</b> retrieved from scrapped Swing Door electric suburban train sets; the re-use of these components reduced the unit cost of the Y class locomotive from around £52,000 ($104,000) to £40,000 ($80,000). Two further orders saw the class total 75 by 1968.|$|R
40|$|Public {{transport}} {{systems and the}} competitiveness of the European rail industry requires innovative solutions, which can enhance comfort and performance as well as reduce system costs. In competition with other {{transport systems}} environmental friendly trains and track systems with high interoperative capabilities {{are more and more}} important. Within the project "High Efficiency <b>Motor</b> <b>Bogie</b> for modern Trains" (HEMBOT), a new fight-weight <b>motor</b> <b>bogie</b> has been developed by component producers, research institutes and end-users introducing modern development technologies and lightweight materials in a simultaneous approach. The capabilities and potential of this development were demonstrated by extensive testing of a prototype mounted on a locomotive...|$|R
50|$|Three {{pre-production}} {{cars were}} delivered to Morioka Depot between January and February 1990, with cars KiHa 110-1 and 2 built by Fuji Heavy Industries, and KiHa 110-3 built by Niigata Tekkō. As with the pre-production KiHa 100-0 cars, these initially had black front ends, pipe-style front-end skirts, black dummy exterior {{windows at the}} toilet positions, and plug doors. Cars KiHa 110-1 and 3 were equipped with Niigata DMF13HZA engines, while KiHa 110-2 was equipped with a Cummins DMF14HZA engine. All three cars used lightweight bolsterless DT58 <b>motored</b> <b>bogies</b> and TR242 trailer bogies, with both axles of the <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> driven.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's frame, <b>bogies</b> and {{traction}} <b>motors</b> {{were later}} {{used to construct}} an electric motor coach which was placed in service between Mason's Mill and Pietermaritzburg. No more suction gas locomotives were acquired.|$|R
50|$|To {{this day}} no {{commercial}} boat has beaten the speed record set by Robert E. Lee during the race. However, <b>Bogie,</b> a 1929 <b>motor</b> boat built by Leroy Craft, beat Robert E. Lees record.|$|R
50|$|Cars 2 and 5 {{each have}} two single-arm {{pantographs}} (only one is normally used), and cars 7 and 10 each have one. Cars 1 and 3 each {{have only one}} <b>motored</b> <b>bogie</b> (at the inner ends).|$|R
50|$|Adams built {{another couple}} of steam railmotors at around the same time, but the concept did not catch on. It was revived {{around the turn of}} the century and the Great Western Railway built up a fleet of around 100 <b>bogie</b> rail <b>motors.</b> These were {{developed}} into an autotrain system whereby the driver of a locomotive could control the train from a cab in the carriage, the forerunner of today's the familiar multiple unit trains.|$|R
50|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>bogies</b> {{were the}} same DT33A bogies as used on the JNR-era 103 series EMUs, and the trailer cars used DT21T bogies {{recovered}} from withdrawn 101 series EMUs. The pantographs were also recovered from withdrawn 101 series EMUs.|$|R
25|$|The {{accommodation}} was of {{the open}} saloon type, then a novelty in Britain; there were gate entrances {{at the end of}} the vehicles. The trailers seated 56 persons, and the motor coaches seated 46, with a raised section over the <b>motor</b> <b>bogie.</b>|$|R
