5000|$|While {{dealing with}} his kids, Mac silently kept the {{criminal}} element in line in Port Charles. He investigated Carly's kidnapping by Ric Lansing and then Ric's disappearance. When a raid on a drug shipment went sour, a shootout between the cops and the mob ensued. One of the cops was shot. Faith later named Zander as the shooter. Desperate, Zander went on the run. Mac didn't realize Maxie was hiding Zander in her room. Maxie managed to get Zander to {{the basement of the}} PC Hotel and promised to get the cash he needed to flee the country. However, Nikolas found Zander first, knocked him out, and called the cops to come arrest him. Mac went to arrest Zander with another officer. Unaware a fire had broken out in the electrical room where Zander was hiding, Mac opened the door. He was caught in a <b>back</b> <b>draft</b> and suffered severe burns. When Maxie found out what had happened to Mac, she went to his bedside to be with him and confessed she had been hiding Zander. When Georgie was finally rescued from the fire and arrived at the hospital, Maxie tearfully informed her of Mac's condition. Dillon supported Georgie as she went to see a badly burned Mac. The sisters continued to worry as Mac's condition seemed to worsen. Tracy Quartermaine kept lurking around, spouting false sympathies in the hopes the girls wouldn't hold the Quartermaines, who owned the hotel, responsible for Mac's condition.

5000|$|By this point, {{the fire}} was moving {{extremely}} fast up the 76% north slope (37.23 degree slope) of Mann gulch and Dodge realized {{they would not be}} able to make the ridge line in front of the fire. With the fire less than a hundred yards behind, he took a match out and set fire to the grass just before them. In doing so, he was attempting to create an escape fire to lie in so that the main fire would burn around him and his crew. In the <b>back</b> <b>draft</b> of the main fire, the grass fire set burned straight up toward the ridge above. Turning to the three men by him -- Robert Sallee, Walter Rumsey and Eldon Diettert -- Dodge said [...] "Up this way", but the men misunderstood him. The three ran straight up for the ridge crest, moving up along the far edge of Dodge's fire. Sallee later said he wasn't sure what Dodge was doing, and thought perhaps he intended the fire to act as a buffer between the men and the main fire. It was not until he got to the ridge crest and looked back down that he realized what Dodge had intended. As the rest of the crew came up, Dodge tried to direct them through the fire he had set and into the center burnt out area. Dodge later stated that someone, possibly squad leader William Hellman, said [...] "To hell with that, I'm getting out of here". The rest of the team raced on past Dodge up the side of the slope toward the hogback of Mann Gulch ridge, hoping they had enough time to get through the rock ridge line and over to safer ground on the other side. None of the men racing up before the fire entered into the escape fire.|$|E

40|$|Background. It is {{estimated}} that hospitals spend between 28 and 33 billion dollars per year {{as a result of}} hospital-acquired infections. (Scott, 2009) The costs continue to rise despite the guidance and controls provided by hospital infection control staff to reduce patient exposures to fungal spores and other infectious agents. With all processes and controls in place, the vented elevator shaft represents an unprotected opening {{from the top of the}} building to the lower floors. The hypothesis for this prospective study is that there is a positive correlation between the number of Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spores, Cladosporium, ascospores, basidiospores in spores/m 3 as individual spore categories found in the hoistway vent of an elevator shaft and the levels of the same spores, sampled near-simultaneously in the outdoor intake of the elevator shaft. Specific aims of this study include determining if external Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spores are entering the healthcare facility via the elevator shaft and hoistway vents. Additional aims include determining levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spores outdoors, in the elevator shafts, and indoors in areas possibly affected by elevator shaft air; and, finally, to evaluate whether any effect is observed due to the installation of a hoistway vent damper, installed serendipitously during this study. ^ Methods. Between April 2010 and September 2010, a total of 3, 521 air samples were collected, including 363 spore trap samples analyzed microscopically for seven spore types, and polymerase chain reaction analyses on 254 air samples. 2178 particle count measurements, 363 temperature readings and 363 relative humidity readings were also obtained from 7 different locations potentially related to the path of air travel inside and near a centrally-located and representative elevator shaft. ^ Results. Mean Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spore values were higher outside the building (530 spores/m 3 of air) than inside the hoistway (22. 8 spores/m 3) during the six month study. Mean values inside the hospital were lower than outside throughout the study, ranging from 15 to 73 spores/m 3 of air. Mean Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spore counts inside the hoistway decreased from 40. 1 spores/m 3 of air to 9 spores/m 3 of air following the installation of a <b>back</b> <b>draft</b> damper between the outside air and the elevator shaft. Comparison of samples collected outside the building and inside the hoistway vent prior to installing the damper indicated a strong positive correlation (Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s Rho= 0. 8008, p= 0. 0001). The similar comparison following the damper installation indicated a moderate non-significant inverse correlation (Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho = − 0. 2795, p= 0. 1347). ^ Conclusion. Elevator shafts are one pathway for mold spores to enter a healthcare facility. A significant correlation was detected between spores and particle counts inside the hoistway and outside prior to changes in the ventilation system. The insertion of the <b>back</b> <b>draft</b> damper appeared to lower the spore counts inside the hoistway and inside the building. The mold spore counts in air outside the study building were higher in the period following the damper installation while the levels inside the hoistway and hospital decreased. Cladosporium and Penicillium/Aspergillus -like spores provided a method for evaluating indoor air quality as a natural tracer from outside the building to inside the building. Ascospores and basidiospores were not a valuable tracer due to low levels of detection during this study. ^ Installation of a <b>back</b> <b>draft</b> damper provides additional protection for the indoor environment of a hospital or healthcare facility, including in particular patients who may be immunocompromised. Current design standards and references do not require the installation of a <b>back</b> <b>draft</b> damper, but evaluation of adding language to relevant building codes should be considered. The data indicate a reduction in levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus -like spores, particle counts and a reduction in relative humidity inside of the elevator shaft after damper installation. ...|$|E
