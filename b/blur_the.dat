5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Lacking Havok, Euphoria, and DMM, Krome's Wii version {{relies on}} the company's {{in-house}} physics engine. Some character animations may be ragdoll while others are preset; in developing the game, Krome tried to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> distinction between the two. The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
40|$|A new {{restoration}} algorithm for partial {{blurred image}} {{which is based}} on blur detection and classification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new blur detection algorithm is proposed to detect <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions in <b>the</b> partial <b>blurred</b> image. Then, a new blur classification algorithm is proposed to classify <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions. Once <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> class of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernels of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed. Then, <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernel estimation methods are adopted to estimate <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernels. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions are restored using nonblind image deblurring algorithm and replace <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions in <b>the</b> partial <b>blurred</b> image with <b>the</b> restored regions. The simulated experiment shows that the proposed algorithm performs well...|$|R

5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like <b>Blur.</b> <b>The</b> Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.

25|$|Anti-Judaism, as a {{rejection}} of a particular {{way of thinking about}} God, is distinct from antisemitism, which is more akin to a form of racism. Scholars wishing to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> line between theology and racism have since coined the term religious antisemitism.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between the earlier and later pieces lies in a new conception of pulse. In the earlier works, the pulse {{is something to be}} divided into two, three and so on. The effect of these different subdivisions, especially when they occur simultaneously, is to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> aural landscape, creating the micropolyphonic effect of Ligeti’s music.|$|E

25|$|For trophic cascades to be ubiquitous, {{communities}} must generally act as food chains, with discrete trophic levels. Most communities, however, have complex food webs. In {{real food}} webs, consumers often feed at multiple trophic levels (omnivory), organisms often change their diet {{as they grow}} larger, cannibalism occurs, and consumers are subsidized by inputs of resources from outside the local community, all of which <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> distinctions between trophic levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{abnormal}} new blood vessels (neovascularisation) form {{at the back}} of the eye as part of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR); these can burst and bleed (vitreous hemorrhage) and <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> vision, because these new blood vessels are fragile. The first time this bleeding occurs, it may not be very severe. In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after few hours.|$|E

For instance, Dudley-born comedian Lenny Henry, Walsall-born rock musician Noddy Holder, Smethwick-reared actress Julie Walters, Wollaston-born soap actress Jan Pearson, West Bromwich-born comedian Frank Skinner, are sometimes mistaken for Brummie-speakers by people outside the West Midlands county.|$|E

25|$|A Gaussian blur {{effect is}} {{typically}} generated by convolving an image with a kernel of Gaussian values. In practice, {{it is best}} {{to take advantage of the}} Gaussian blur’s separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two-dimensional kernel in a single pass, but requires fewer calculations.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later six Nicaraguan cities rose in revolt. Armed youths took over the {{highland}} city of Matagalpa. Tercerista cadres attacked Guard posts in Managua, Masaya, León, Chinandega and Estelí. Large numbers of semi-armed civilians joined the revolt and put the Guard garrisons of the latter four cities under siege. The September Insurrection of 1978 was subdued {{at the cost of}} several thousand, mostly civilian, casualties. Members of all three factions fought in these uprisings, which began to <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> divisions and prepare the way for unified action.|$|E
25|$|Fantasy is {{commonly}} associated with science fiction, {{and a number of}} writers have worked in both genres, while writers such as Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K.

The authors' professional organization is called the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics, and fantasy authors such as J. K. Rowling have won the highest honor within the science fiction field, the Hugo Award.|$|E

25|$|Other proa {{designers}} <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> {{lines between}} Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The Harryproa from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This {{would normally be}} more like an Atlantic proa, but the rig is on the lee hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place {{the bulk of the}} passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the lee side to provide a greater righting moment.|$|E
25|$|Localization of lesions or {{inflammatory}} {{and infectious}} processes {{can be difficult}} to discern on chest radiograph, but can be inferenced by silhouetting and the hilum overlay sign with adjacent structures. If either hemidiaphragm is blurred, for example, this suggests the lesion to be from the corresponding lower lobe. If the right heart border is blurred, than the pathology is likely in the right middle lobe, though a cavum deformity can also <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> right heard border due to indentation of the adjacent sternum. If the left heart border is blurred, this implies a process at the lingula.|$|E
