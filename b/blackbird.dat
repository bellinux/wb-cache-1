5|$|In Europe, {{the common}} <b>blackbird</b> can be {{confused}} with the paler-winged first-winter ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus) or the superficially similar European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). A number of similar Turdus thrushes exist far outside the range of the common <b>blackbird,</b> for example the South American Chiguanco thrush (Turdus chiguanco). The Indian <b>blackbird,</b> the Tibetan <b>blackbird,</b> and the Chinese <b>blackbird</b> were formerly considered subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Two related Asian Turdus thrushes, the white-collared <b>blackbird</b> (T. albocinctus) and the grey-winged <b>blackbird</b> (T. boulboul), {{are also}} named blackbirds, and the Somali thrush (T. (olivaceus) ludoviciae) is {{alternatively}} {{known as the}} Somali <b>blackbird.</b>|$|E
5|$|A common <b>blackbird</b> has {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 2.4 years, and, {{based on data from}} bird ringing, the oldest recorded age is 21 years and 10 months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackbirds</b> of 1939 was an African-American {{musical theater}} show in Lew Leslie's series of <b>Blackbirds</b> revues.

5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common <b>blackbird</b> has a {{preference}} for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common <b>blackbird</b> also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), but this is minimal because the common <b>blackbird</b> recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its non-mimetic eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs. The introduced merula <b>blackbird</b> in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, {{lost the ability to}} recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious <b>blackbird,</b> the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious <b>blackbird</b> is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Blackbirding</b> is the {{coercion}} {{of people}} through trickery and kidnapping {{to work as}} labourers. From the 1860s, <b>blackbirding</b> ships in the Pacific sought workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands in Peru. In the 1870s, the <b>blackbirding</b> trade focused on supplying labourers to plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland and Fiji. The first documented practice of a major <b>blackbirding</b> industry for sugar cane labourers occurred between 1842 and 1904. Those [...] "blackbirded" [...] were recruited from the indigenous populations of nearby Pacific islands or northern Queensland. In {{the early days of}} the pearling industry in Western Australia at Nickol Bay and Broome, local Aborigines were <b>blackbirded</b> from the surrounding areas.|$|R

5|$|The common <b>blackbird</b> occurs up to 1000metres (3300ft) in Europe, 2300metres (7590ft) in North Africa, and at 900–1820metres (3000–6000ft) in peninsular India and Sri Lanka, but {{the large}} Himalayan {{subspecies}} range much higher, with T. m. maximus breeding at 3200–4800metres (10560–16000ft) and remaining above 2100metres (6930ft) even in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the <b>blackbird,</b> the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E
40|$|For last 150 years, <b>blackbirds</b> {{have moved}} from their ancestral habitat, the {{woodland}} edge, toman-made habitats such as farmland, parks and gardens.

I compared density of nests and <b>blackbirds</b> in parks, woodland and campus of University ofEast Anglia to investigate habitat preference. <b>Blackbirds</b> preferred the area covered by 10 ～ 50 % of tree or bushpatches for their foraging and nesting sites. <b>Blackbirds</b> were more frequently found near buildings rather thanfar from buildings. Nest characteristics did not affect predation rate and nest preference. This study suggeststhat man-made habitats may be important for avoiding predation...|$|R

5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the song thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the <b>blackbird</b> (T. merula).|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border.

40|$|<b>Blackbirds</b> (Icteridae) {{annually}} damage US$ 5 – 8 {{million of}} ripening sunflower {{in the northern}} Great Plains. Baiting <b>blackbirds</b> with avicide-treated rice during spring migration might reduce the regional breeding population. In March and April 1996 – 1997, we simulated a baiting program in eastern South Dakota to compare attractiveness of rice-baited plots placed in fields of corn and soybean stubble. <b>Blackbirds</b> used plots in corn stubble more often than plots in soybean stubble and chose rice-baited plots over unbaited reference plots. We conclude that <b>blackbirds</b> can be successfully baited with avicide-treated rice placed in corn stubble. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|After the {{reproductive}} period, <b>blackbirds</b> {{in the northern}} Great Plains aggregate in large flocks that feed on ripening crops, especially sunflower. At today’s prices, <b>blackbirds</b> eat about $ 8 – 12 million of sunflower annually in northern Great Plains, with most of this damage occurring in North Dakota and South Dakota (Peer et al. 2003). Additional expenditures are incurred by producers trying to protect their crop, including the costs in time, travel, and materials for hazing <b>blackbirds.</b> A chemical feeding repellent would be ideal for protecting sunflower from <b>blackbirds</b> because it would not only cut the amount of losses from foraging but also reduce hazing costs...|$|R
