40|$|The greater {{reluctance}} of low-income, low-wealth <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> to use checking and savings accounts than of low-income, low-wealth White families is only partially explained by regression models that consider {{a wide array}} of demographic variables. The greater reluctance impedes <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> from getting the benefits of participat-ing in financial markets. Moreover, the success of low-income, low-wealth Black fami-lies in managing credit is not found to differ from that of low-income, low-wealth White <b>families.</b> But the <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> owe less credit card and other noncollateralized debt than do the White families, implying either that <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> have a lower demand for such debt or that lenders are biased against them. <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> are less likely to achieve wealth increases than are White families because of differences in labor income and, to a lesser degree, gifts and inheritances. This has implications for the continued wealth disparity between Black Americans and White Americans...|$|R

40|$|Family is {{regarded}} as a powerful force in the lives of <b>Black</b> Americans. Often-times, <b>families</b> function as an agent of socialization that counters racism. At the same time, however, <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> can perpetuate skin tone conscious-ness and bias, or colorism. Although there is an extensive body of revisionist literature on <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> and a growing body of scholarship on the contem-porary nature of colorism, there is a dearth of literature addressing the role of <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> in relation to colorism. This research begins to fill this gap by exploring the influence of <b>Black</b> <b>families</b> in the development and maintenance of a colorist ideology and consciousness among Black women. Results of focus group interviews with 26 Black women indicate that color differences are learned, reinforced, and in some cases contested within <b>families,</b> ultimately shaping <b>Black</b> women’s perspectives and experiences with colorism...|$|R

5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a <b>black</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} Brierre's death, the detectives have made little {{progress}} on their lead about Kaja, the victim's abusive ex-boyfriend. Ballard and Gharty suggest they {{look more closely}} at Felix Wilson and his son, Hal (Jeffrey Wright), because Brierre had sex before her death and knew few men socially besides them. Pembleton and Gee, who are both very respectful of Felix Wilson's contributions to the African American community, dismiss the suggestion; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample. The next day's Baltimore Sun runs a story about the investigation into Kaja, which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime. Ballard and Gharty question Hal, who denies having sex with Brierre after tough questions from Gharty. After the interview, Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected <b>black</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a <b>black</b> <b>family,</b> the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster {{and hit him}} twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
