5|$|In 2010, Norman {{became the}} 17th {{city in the}} United States to adopt a council {{resolution}} giving it status as a Fair Trade Town. The resolution states that the city of Norman supports the purchasing of goods from the local community; when goods cannot be purchased locally the city will support <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> producers abroad who meet Fair Trade standards. These standards include supporting {{quality of life in}} developing countries and planning for environmental sustainability.|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E
5|$|Empire: Total War {{ships with}} nine {{different}} versions of box art, eight of which represent the major faction for the market the game is sold in, and one general international version. For instance, German customers are presented artwork displaying colours with the Prussian eagle and Prussian army uniforms, whilst the American artwork shows the American revolutionaries and the Betsy Ross flag. A special edition version of Empire: Total War entitled Special Forces incorporates six elite faction-specific units: HMS Victory, the French Irish Brigade, Spanish guerillas, Gurkha infantry, Rogers' Rangers and the Ottoman Ribauldequin. Additionally, three retailers were provided with a special unit for customers to receive; Amazon.com customers were given the Dahomey Amazons, buyers from Best Buy were able to receive the USS Constitution and customers <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> Game received the Death's Head Hussars. A further 14 units were added {{with the objective of}} increasing graphical and unit variety among the factions. These 14 units were released as part of the game's 1.3 patch in June 2009; accompanying the update was a second set of 14 units, released as downloadable content for purchase.|$|E

Similarly, B.C. <b>buys</b> <b>from</b> Alberta frequently during off-peak periods (weekends, evenings, or statutory holidays when demand in Alberta diminishes). This arrangement confers benefits on both provinces.|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century, the {{position}} of fairs began to decline. The larger merchants, particularly in London, began to establish direct links with the larger landowners such as the nobility and the church; rather than the landowner <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> a chartered fair, they would buy directly from the merchant. Meanwhile, the growth of the indigenous England merchant class in the major cities, especially London, gradually crowded out the foreign merchants upon whom the great chartered fairs had largely depended. The crown's control over trade in the towns, especially the emerging newer towns towards {{the end of the}} 15th century that lacked central civic government, was increasingly weaker, making chartered status less relevant as more trade occurred from private properties and took place all year around. Nonetheless, the great fairs remained of importance well into the 15th century, as illustrated by their role in exchanging money, regional commerce and in providing choice for individual consumers.|$|E
5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E
25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may {{use any of}} {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from seed {{propagation}} to collecting expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or lesser}} extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai face some challenges, however, particularly of <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, the plant will have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by import regulations and may require a license or other special import arrangement on the buyer's part. If a local commercial bonsai grower does not exist, <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> a distant one may be unsatisfactory.|$|E

It was designed by and named after Hugh Halligan, a First Deputy Fire Chief in the New York City Fire Department, in 1948.

25|$|The Germans {{tried to}} divide the Poles from the Jews using several laws. One law was that Poles were {{forbidden}} from <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> Jewish shops; if they did so, they were subject to execution. Maria Brodacka was the first Pole to be killed by the Germans for helping a Jew. The Germans used the incident to kill 100 Jews being held as hostages. At {{the start of the}} war 1335 Poles were killed for sheltering Jews.|$|E
25|$|As {{the area}} lacked many {{industries}} at the time, supplies {{were difficult to}} acquire. This was made more difficult when the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Doctor John McLoughlin denied the shipbuilders the ability to purchase supplies from Fort Vancouver. McLoughlin refused, claiming {{that he did not}} think the boat would be seaworthy and even if it was able to set sail that the owners may attempt piracy with the ship. Therefore, the builders covertly procured supplies elsewhere, mainly through <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> other settlers. Additionally, the Methodist Mission’s blacksmith Josiah Lamberson Parrish would make metal spikes needed for the ship, plus Thomas J. Hubbard also made spikes for the ship.|$|E

25|$|Some people—including German soldiers—benefited {{from the}} black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers {{especially}} diverted meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens {{and the availability of}} milk products permitted better survival. The official ration provided starvation level diets of one thousand thirteen or fewer calories a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2010, the University of California, San Diego became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego {{understood}} {{the efforts of the}} Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.|$|E
25|$|After STW-9 {{entered the}} market, a 'cartel' was formed {{between the two}} {{stations}} for the duty of <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> both Australian and overseas production sources. The two stations set up a separate company, TV Facilities, (50%/50% partners). This allowed the stations to purchase programs cheaper than if they were two separate entities, which would bid on shows and subsequently raise prices. This partnership was disliked by Eastern States stations who could not increase their charges to the extent which they would have liked. Allocation of programs was decided by a coin toss, which would allow the winner to pick first and then alternate the picking of programs. However TVW would always be in a more dominant position as it had the rights to continuing shows from the previous six years as well as half of the new programs.|$|E

25|$|Parrots may {{not make}} good pets for most people because of their natural wild {{instincts}} such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt impulse <b>buying</b> <b>from</b> unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated budgerigar, a small parrot, {{is the most popular}} of all pet bird species. In 1992, the newspaper USA Today published that 11 million pet birds were in the United States alone, many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the rose-ringed parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the Elder. As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl says in his 1987 book The Grey Parrot that some importers had parrots drink only coffee while they were shipped by boat, believing that pure water was detrimental and that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that the caffeine in coffee is toxic to birds.|$|E
500|$|Balabushka took Spain up on {{his offer}} after seeing {{the quality of his}} splices. <b>Buying</b> <b>from</b> Spain also had the {{advantage}} {{that he was able to}} have Spain customize the blanks to his specifications. During this period Balabushka began incorporating more elaborate details into his cues, including the eponymous Bushka rings innovation. Many later cuemakers would install Bushka rings both above the wrap and on the butt sleeve below the wrap. Balabushka used them only above the wrap, which is believed to have aided him in keeping the [...] higher on the cue. In 1970, Spain sold his cue business to tool and die maker John Davis, who had been assisting Spain for a number of years. Balabushka continued buying blanks from Davis until 1971.|$|E

[...] "Globalization is not new, though.

Likewise, for centuries, people and corporations have invested in enterprises in other countries. In fact, many of the features of the current wave of globalization are similar to those prevailing before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914." ...|$|E
