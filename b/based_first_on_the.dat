5000|$|The {{case for}} strong and urgent action {{set out in}} the Review is <b>based,</b> <b>first,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> severe risks that the science now {{identifies}} (together with the additional uncertainties ... that it points to but that are difficult to quantify) and, second, on the ethics of the responsibilities of existing generations in relation to succeeding generations. It is these two things that are crucial: risk and ethics. Different commentators may vary in their emphasis, but it is the two together that are crucial. Jettison either one and you will have a much reduced programme for action—and if you judge risks to be small and attach little significance to future generations you will not regard global warming as a problem. It is surprising that the earlier economic literature on climate change did not give risk and ethics the attention they so clearly deserve, and it is because we chose to make them central and explicit that we think we were right for the right reasons.|$|E

Most of the results are <b>based,</b> <b>first,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> design of more and more involved class of functionals and, finally, on the use of the famous Jensen's inequality. In contrast with this design process, the present paper aims at providing a generic set of integral inequalities which are asymptotically non conservative and then to design functionals driven by these inequalities. The resulting set of stability conditions forms a hierarchy of LMI which is competitive with the most efficient existing methods (delay-partitioning, discretization and sum of squares), in terms of conservatism and of complexity. Finally, some examples show the efficiency of the method...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{research}} that opposes {{the strategy of}} strong and urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions often makes the observation, misleadingly, that while scientists, environmentalists, politicians, and others would favor strong action, economists would not. Drawing on the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, this paper argues that strong and urgent action is in fact good economics. Much of the previous economic literature on climate change has failed to grasp the necessary scale and timing of action because it has failed to simultaneously assign the necessary importance to issues of risk and ethics.

The model is <b>based,</b> <b>first,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existence of large scale density fluctuations that are able to efficiently diffuse small k beam unstable Langmuir waves in phase space, and, second, on the presence of a significantly isotropic nonthermal tail in the distribution function of the background electron population, which is capable of stabilizing larger k modes.
