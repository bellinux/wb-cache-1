50|$|If {{the broad}} gauge had {{originally}} been an asset, the reality by the 1870s was that the narrow gauge of 4 ft 8½in (1,435 mm) had become the standard gauge, and beyond the Great Western Railway {{the vast majority of}} lines adopted it. As trade increased, this led to troublesome difficulties at the point of junction between lines—the <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge—where <b>goods</b> had to be physically transshipped between wagons for onward transit. In July 1874 the Somerset and Dorset Railway completed its Bath extension, and narrow gauge wagons could reach Exeter and beyond from the Midlands over that route and the LSWR.|$|R

"Military necessity, as {{understood}} by modern civilized nations, consists in {{the necessity of}} those measures which are indispensable for securing {{the ends of the}} war, and which are lawful according to the modern law and usages of war. Military necessity admits of all direct destruction of life or limb of armed enemies, and of other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable in the armed contests of the war; it allows of the capturing of every armed enemy, and every enemy of importance to the hostile government, or of peculiar danger to the captor; it allows of all destruction of property, and obstruction of the ways and channels of traffic, travel, or communication, and of all withholding of sustenance or means of life from the enemy; of the appropriation of whatever an enemy's country affords necessary for the subsistence and safety of the Army, and of such deception as does not involve the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith either positively pledged, regarding agreements entered into during the war, or supposed by the modern law of war to exist. (...But...) Men who take up arms against one another in public war do not cease on this account to be moral beings, responsible to one another and to God. Military necessity does not admit of cruelty—that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge, nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions. It does not admit of the use of poison in any way, nor of the wanton devastation of a district. It admits of deception, but disclaims acts of perfidy; and, in general, military necessity does not include any act of hostility which makes the return to peace unnecessarily difficult." ...|$|R

Until, that is, a rejected lover <b>breaks</b> the rules <b>of</b> <b>good</b> form.
