5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism {{was observed}} in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for expression of albinism.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness is thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E

5|$|Leguat {{mentioned}} that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets {{would have been}} the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy Pingré visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes do {{not occur}} in the Atlantic Ocean.

Sea snakes {{do not occur}} in the Red Sea, believed to be due to its increased salinity, so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal. A lack of salinity is also thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why Pelamis has not crossed into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don.

In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Calderwood {{took over}} in 2004 and Aberdeen posted more {{consistent}} results than in previous seasons. In the 2006–07 season, the club finished in third place {{in the league and}} entered the final qualifying round for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Aberdeen defeated Dnipro on the away goals rule to progress (the first time Aberdeen had won on away goals in European football for 40 years). They went on to beat F.C. Copenhagen 4–0, which was the biggest margin of victory and one of Pittodrie's biggest crowds since the 1980s. This set up a meeting with German giants Bayern Munich, which they lost 7–3 on aggregate after a 2–2 draw which saw Aberdeen lead twice in the first leg. Calderwood was sacked by Aberdeen on 24 May 2009, hours after he took the club to a fourth-place finish and back into Europe. Poor domestic cup performances were thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for Calderwood's dismissal.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest the ovaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same as}} in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay the number is 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, is believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> behind this anomaly. The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E
5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons. This great perturbation may possibly <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why the satellite system of Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet and all its moons seen in the satellite systems of all the other giant planets.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using carbon disulfide and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E
