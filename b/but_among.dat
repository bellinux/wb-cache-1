5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} {{contemplated}} by the South Vietnamese was doomed {{by the thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among South Vietnamese units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too common as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> the regular troops.|$|E

It was estimated that ITV would stand to make £9million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10million if it went to extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved. Among the confirmed advertisers on ITV were Ford, Cadbury, Nike, Heineken, Audi and BlackBerry. Sky's advertising prices were not reported, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> their scheduled advertisers were Audi, Ford, Nike, Samsung and Pepsi.|$|E

5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
5|$|The {{defending}} army, the Nanking Garrison Force, was {{on paper}} a formidable army of thirteen divisions, including three elite German-trained divisions plus the super-elite Training Brigade, {{but in reality}} most of these units had trickled back to Nanking severely mauled from the fighting in Shanghai. By {{the time they reached}} Nanking they were physically exhausted, low on equipment, and badly depleted in total troop strength. In order to replenish some of these units, 16,000 young men and teenagers from Nanking and the rural villages surrounding it were speedily pressed into service as new recruits. An additional 14,000 fresh soldiers were brought in from Hankou to fill the ranks of the 2nd Army. However, due the unexpected rapidity of the Japanese advance, most of the new conscripts received only rudimentary training on how to fire their guns on their way to or upon their arrival at the frontlines. No definitive statistics exist on how many soldiers the Nanking Garrison Force had managed to cobble together {{by the time of the}} battle, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> leading estimates are those of David Askew who says 73,790 to 81,500, those of Ikuhiko Hata who estimates 100,000, and those of Tokushi Kasahara who argues in favor of about 150,000.|$|E

5|$|The team {{achieved}} ten {{victories in}} 2011, {{down from a}} tally of seventeen the previous season, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> the ten {{were some of the}} most difficult days of racing in the entire season. These included back-to-back stages with summit finishes at the Giro d'Italia, with Igor Antón winning at the summit of the Monte Zoncolan, and Mikel Nieve, who won by over 90 seconds the following day at the Val di Fassa. The squad's captain at the Tour de France, Samuel Sánchez won the first high-mountain finish of the race, up to Luz Ardiden; he eventually finished the race in fifth place overall, and won the King of the Mountains sub-classification. Though he failed to figure as an overall contender at the Vuelta a España, Antón won the first Vuelta stage ending in the Basque Country in 33 years, a stage with clear importance for the team.|$|E
5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer. Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously. He would take {{up to two years}} to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, <b>but</b> <b>among</b> his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. <b>But</b> <b>among</b> his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E
