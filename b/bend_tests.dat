This term generally refers to testing and analysis focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds. These are divided into destructive and non-destructive methods. A few examples of destructive testing include macro etch testing, fillet-weld break tests, transverse tension tests, and guided <b>bend</b> <b>tests.</b> Other destructive methods include acid etch testing, back bend testing, tensile strength break testing, nick break testing, and free bend testing. Non-destructive methods include fluorescent penetrate tests, magnaflux tests, eddy current (electromagnetic) tests, hydrostatic testing, tests using magnetic particles, X-rays and gamma ray based methods and acoustic emission techniques. [...] Other methods include ferrite and hardness testing.|$|E

Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens.

Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R

In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram. After the crack starts to grow, photomicrographs are taken in regular intervals in order to obtain the crack growth curve. – The fatigue limit and crack growth curves obtained from the rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> are compared with results from conventional single edge notch bending specimens. Agreement is good, with the results from the rotating bending experiments lying somewhat on the conservative side.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{influence}} of specimen polishing, specimen configuration, and specimen size on the transverse tension strength of two glass epoxy materials loaded in {{three and four}} point bending was evaluated. Polishing machined edges, and/or tension side failure surfaces, was detrimental to specimen strength characterization instead of yielding a higher, more accurate, strength {{as a result of}} removing inherent manufacture and handling flaws. Transverse tension strength was sensitive to span length due to the classical weakest link effect. However, strength was less sensitive to volume changes achieved by increasing specimen width. The Weibull scaling law over-predicted changes in transverse tension strengths in three point <b>bend</b> <b>tests</b> and under-predicted changes in transverse tension strengths in four point <b>bend</b> <b>tests.</b> Furthermore, the Weibull slope varied with specimen configuration, volume, and sample size. Hence, the utility of this scaling law for predicting transverse tension strength is unclear...|$|E

40|$|This report covers an {{investigation}} of the nature and cause of failure in Nitinol brachytherapy sourcewires. The investigation was initiated after two clinical incidents in which sourcewires failed during or immediately after a treatment. The investigation determined that the two clinical Nitinol sourcewires failed in a brittle manner, which is atypical for Nitinol. There were no material anomalies or subcritical flaws to explain the brittle failures. The <b>bend</b> <b>tests</b> also demonstrated that neither moist environment, radiation, nor low-temperature structural transformation was a likely root cause of the failures. However, degradation of the PTFE was consistently evident, and those sourcewires shipped or stored with PTFE sleeves consistently failed in laboratory <b>bend</b> <b>tests.</b> On the basis of the results of this study, it was concluded that the root cause of the in-service failures of the sourcewires was environmentally induced embrittlement due to the breakdown of the PTFE protective sleeves {{in the presence of the}} high-radiation field and subsequent reaction or interaction of the breakdown products with the Nitinol alloy...|$|E
