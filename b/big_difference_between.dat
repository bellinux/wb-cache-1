25|$|Note {{that there}} is a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> pool types. Indoor pools of 25 m give the {{advantage}} of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E
25|$|The {{input-output}} equations {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we could know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E

500|$|In 1635, a {{difficult}} situation occurred when senior pastor John Wilson returned from a lengthy trip to England {{where he had been}} settling his affairs. [...] Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and she immediately saw a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> her own doctrines and his. [...] She found his emphasis on morality and his doctrine of [...] "evidencing justification by sanctification" [...] to be disagreeable. She told her followers that Wilson lacked [...] "the seal of the Spirit." [...] Wilson's theological views were in accord with all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton, who stressed [...] "the inevitability of God's will" [...] ("free grace") as opposed to preparation (works). [...] Hutchinson and her allies had become accustomed to Cotton's doctrines, and they began disrupting Wilson's sermons, even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} paper, Serre {{found the first}} place that p-torsion occurs in the {{homotopy}} groups of n dimensional spheres, by showing that πn+k(S'n) has no p-torsion if k < 2p − 3, and has a unique subgroup of order p if n ≥ 3 and k = 2p − 3. [...] The case of 2-dimensional spheres is slightly different: the first p-torsion occurs for k = 2p − 3 + 1. In the case of odd torsion there are more precise results; in this case there is a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> odd and even dimensional spheres. If p is an odd prime and n = 2i + 1, then elements of the p-component of πn+k(S'n) have order at most p'i [...] This is in some sense the best possible result, as these groups {{are known to have}} elements of this order for some values of k [...] Furthermore, the stable range can be extended in this case: if n is odd then the double suspension from πk(S'n) to πk+2(S'n+2) is an isomorphism of p-components if k < p(n + 1) − 3, and an epimorphism if equality holds [...] The p-torsion of the intermediate group πk+1(S'n+1) can be strictly larger.|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out." ...|$|E

500|$|In the pulpit, Wilson {{was said}} to have a voice that was harsh and indistinct and his {{demeanor}} was directed at strict discipline, but he had a penchant for rhymes, and would frequently engage in word play. [...] He was unpopular during his early days of preaching in Boston, partly attributable to his strictness in teaching, and partly from his violent and arbitrary manner. [...] His gruff style was further highlighted by the mild qualities of John Cotton, with whom he shared the church's ministry. [...] When Wilson returned to Boston in 1635, Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and immediately saw a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> her own doctrines and his. [...] She found his emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of [...] "evidencing justification by sanctification" [...] (a covenant of works) to be repugnant, and she told her followers that Wilson lacked [...] "the seal of the Spirit." [...] Wilson's doctrines were shared with all of the other ministers in the colony, except for Cotton, and the Boston congregation had grown accustomed to Cotton's lack of emphasis on preparation [...] "in favor of stressing the inevitability of God's will." [...] The positions of Cotton and Wilson were matters of emphasis, and neither minister believed that works could help to save a person. [...] It is likely that most members of the Boston church could not see much difference between the doctrines of the two men, but the astute Hutchinson could, prompting her to criticize Wilson at her home gatherings. [...] Probably in early 1636 he became aware of divisions within his own Boston congregation, and soon came to realize that Hutchinson's views were widely divergent from those of the orthodox clergy in the colony.|$|E

2500|$|There is a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{the kinds}} of {{formulas}} seen in traditional term logic and the predicate calculus that is the fundamental advance of modern logic. [...] The formula A(P,Q) (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula [...] in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for universal quantification and implication rather than just the predicate letter A and using variable arguments [...] where traditional logic uses just the term letter P. [...] With the complexity comes power, {{and the advent of}} the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.|$|E
2500|$|Immanuel Kant and his {{followers}} held that shame is heteronomous (comes from others); Bernard Williams and others have argued that shame can be autonomous (comes from oneself). Shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable. Another view of shame and embarrassment says that the two emotions lie on a continuum and only differ in intensity. Simply put: [...] A person who feels guilt is saying [...] "I did something bad.", while someone who feels shame is saying [...] "I am bad". [...] There is a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two.|$|E

2500|$|Because of how {{central to}} the plot {{randomness}} is, NPC behavior was not scripted. Instead, each NPC is assigned certain goals to accomplish based upon whether they are a replicant or a human.

The developers likened this aspect of the game to simulation games such as SimCity rather than traditional adventure games such as Myst. Castle explains, [...] "those agents are real, goal-oriented artificial intelligences. We don't know what they're going to do, exactly. We've given them behavior, we haven't given them instructions.

[...] Heidi Beirich claimed MacDonald blames the deaths of [...] "millions of people" [...] on [...] "the failure of Jewish assimilation into European societies". MacDonald rebutted that he contends that inter-group competition {{is at the root}} of anti-Semitism and bloody conflicts between Jews and non-Jews throughout history: [...] "I think that my critics essentially want me to assert that Jewish behavior is utterly irrelevant to anti-Semitism, and I cannot accept that point of view. I am hardly alone in supposing that Jewish behaviorvery often Jewish successmust be taken into account in any adequate theory of anti-Semitism." ...|$|E

His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticised from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain Michael Vaughan, who remarked [...] "I thought he (Shoaib) was a <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two teams".
