50|$|Flat-panel {{membrane}} keyboards {{are most}} often found on appliances like microwave ovens or photocopiers. A common design consists of three layers. The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back. Under this it has a spacer layer, which holds the front and <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> apart {{so that they do}} not normally make electrical contact. The <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid. This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed.|$|E

50|$|In the {{laboratory}} at his father's house Merton had bombarded various newly discovered phosphorescent powders with cathode rays. He {{was surprised to}} find that while all lit brilliantly, the afterglow was brief and feeble. By experiment, he discovered that this was because the excitation and emission lines of the spectra barely overlapped, and that by mixing suitable powders he could increase the afterglow. He realized that persistent afterglow could be got by a double layer of powders, in which the light emitted by the <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> excited the front layer, but as this technique seemed to have no practical use he forgot about it for thirty-three years, until 1938 when Sir Henry Tizard asked if he could achieve such a long afterglow. Merton was able to reply by return of post, and soon after was asked to join the air defence committee where he learned that his discovery had made possible the two-layer long-persistence radar screens which helped to bring victory in the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, Fujifilm {{introduced}} {{their own}} line of instant photographic products in 1981 starting with the Fotorama line of cameras. The name Fotorama came from photograph and panorama, as the film was a wide format compared to the square Polaroid SX-70/600 films. These Integral films developed similar to Kodak's with the <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> first. This presented {{a major problem for}} Fujifilm because of the ongoing litigation between Kodak and Polaroid. Polaroid also has a separate suit with Fujifilm and their instant film patents in Japan. When Kodak lost, Fujifilm was able to work with Polaroid to allow their cameras and films to remain in the market, provided that they have a technology sharing agreement. Polaroid was interested in branching out to magnetic media in the boom of the videotape era and had acquired a company called MagMedia Ltd. Fujifilm has a long history in magnetic media dating to the mid-1950s. This led to Polaroid having access to Fujifilm's extensive electronic, video tape and floppy disc magnetic products. This allowed Fujifilm access to Polaroid's film technology.|$|E
5000|$|Double Vision {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} and best known video works by American (born 1937) artist Peter Campus. [...] Running 14 minutes and 22 seconds, It is a single channel video created with two video cameras fed through a mixer, providing the effect of a photographic double exposure. The video is divided into seven parts, each referencing a phenomenal mode of perception or form of biological sight. Each part utilizes a different configuration of the video cameras to film the interior of a small loft space. It opens with the title Double Vision superimposed over a photograph of a fundus (the <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> of the retina) taken through an ophthalmoscope. [...] Campus described the video as [...] "an exploration of double or two-camera images, relating to the evolution of sight in animals. The tape begins with an uncoordinated two-camera image and works its way up to an eye-brain model, always conscious of how this model differed from its subject matter." [...] Campus's contemporary Bill Viola wrote in Art in America: [...] "Unlike many of his contemporaries who used the surveillance camera as a detached, fixed observer documenting the performer’s actions, Campus assigned an active, independent ontological status to the camera eye." [...] The room the video takes place in has also been said to take on the role of subject. Campus said in 2003, [...] "When I was young I made myself a prisoner of my room. It became part of me, an extension of my being. I thought of the walls as my shell. The room as a container had some relationship to the imaginary space inside a monitor." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} two-dimensional {{finite element}} model which simulates the in-air reverberation image produced by medical ultrasonic transducers has been developed. The model simulates a linear array consisting of 128 PZT- 5 A crystals, a tungsten-epoxy <b>backing</b> <b>layer,</b> an Araldite matching layer, and a Perspex lens layer. The thickness of the crystal layer is chosen to simulate pulses centered at 4 [*]MHz. The model is used to investigate whether changes in the electromechanical properties of the individual transducer <b>layers</b> (<b>backing</b> <b>layer,</b> crystal layer, matching layer, and lens layer) {{have an effect on}} the simulated in-air reverberation image generated. Changes in the electromechanical properties are designed to simulate typical medical transducer faults such as crystal drop-out, lens delamination, and deterioration in piezoelectric efficiency. The simulations demonstrate that fault-related changes in transducer behaviour can be observed in the simulated in-air reverberation image pattern. This exploratory approach may help to provide insight into deterioration in transducer performance and help with early detection of faults...|$|R

The design principle, adhesion performance and roles of different toes of footpad are explored and discussed in this paper. The effect of the preload velocity, peeling velocity and thickness of <b>backing</b> <b>layering</b> on the reliability of the robot are investigated. Results show that pull-force is independent of preload velocity, while the peeling force is relying on peeling velocity, and the peel strength increased with the increasing thickness of the <b>backing</b> <b>layer.</b> The climbing experiments show that the robot can climb under mimic zero gravity by using multiple toes facilitating adhesion. The robot with new type of footpads also provides a good platform for testing different adhesive materials for the future space applications...|$|R
5000|$|The water-solubility of {{the organic}} {{constituent}} of the absorber material make devices highly prone to rapid degradation in moist environments. The degradation which is caused by moisture can be reduced by optimizing the constituent materials, {{the architecture of the}} cell, the interfaces and the environment conditions during the fabrication steps. [...] Encapsulating the perovskite absorber with a composite of carbon nanotubes and an inert polymer matrix has been demonstrated to successfully prevent the immediate degradation of the material when exposed to moist ambient air at elevated temperatures. However, no long term studies and comprehensive encapsulation techniques have yet been demonstrated for perovskite solar cells. Besides moisture instability, it has also been shown that the embodiment of devices in which a mesoporous TiO2 layer is sensitized with the perovskite absorber exhibits UV light induced instability. The cause for the observed decline in device performance of those solar cells is linked to the interaction between photogenerated holes inside the TiO2 and oxygen radicals on the surface of TiO2.The measured ultra low thermal conductivity of 0.5 W/(Km) at room temperature in CH3NH3PbI3 can prevent fast propagation of the light deposited heat, and keep the cell resistive on thermal stresses that can reduce its life time. The PbI2 residue in perovskite film has been experimentally demonstrated to {{have a negative effect on}} the long-term stability of devices. The stabilization problem is claimed to be solved by replacing the organic transport layer with a metal oxide layer, allowing the cell to retain 90% capacity after 60 days. Besides, the two instabilities issues can be solved by using multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The front coating can prevent the UV light of the whole incident solar spectrum from negatively interacting with the PSC stack by converting it into visible light, and the <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> can prevent water from permeation within the solar cell stack. The resulting devices demonstrated excellent stability in terms of power conversion efficiencies during a 180-day aging test in the lab and a real outdoor condition test for more than 3 months.|$|E

40|$|Metallic {{nanostructures}} can excite surface plasmons and can dramatically {{increase the}} {{optical path length}} in thin active photovoltaic layers to enhance overall photoabsorption. This effect has potential for cost and weight reduction with thinned layers and also for efficiency enhancement associated with increased carrier excitation level in the absorber layer. We have observed short-circuit current and efficiency enhancements under AM 1. 5 G solar spectrum for GaAs cells with dense arrays of Ag nanoparticles deposited through porous alumina membrane masks, relative to reference GaAs cells with no metal nanoparticle array. This photocurrent enhancement is attributed to the scattering effects of metal nanoparticles for light incident into photovoltaic layers. A simple optical model representing metal nanoparticle surface plasmon resonances and multi-angle scattering has been developed and well explains the spectral behavior of the experimental photocurrent enhancement. A novel ultrathin GaAs cell structure with a metallic <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> has been also developed with a bonding and layer transfer technique.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) envelope glycoproteins E 1 and E 2 form a non-covalently linked heterodimer on the viral {{surface that}} mediates viral entry. E 1, E 2 and the heterodimer complex E 1 E 2 are candidate vaccine antigens, but are technically challenging to study because of difficulties in producing natively folded proteins by standard protein expression and purification methods. To better comprehend the antigenicity of these proteins, {{a library of}} alanine scanning mutants comprising the entirety of E 1 E 2 (555 residues) was created for evaluating the role of each residue in the glycoproteins. The mutant library was probed, by a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay, for binding with the co-receptor CD 81, and a panel of 13 human and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target continuous and discontinuous epitopes of E 1, E 2, and the E 1 E 2 complex. Together with the recently determined crystal structure of E 2 core domain (E 2 c), we found that several residues in the E 2 <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> region indirectly impact binding of CD 81 and mAbs that target the conserved neutralizing face of E 2. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the E 2 <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> in interacting with the E 2 front layer for its biological function. We also identified regions of E 1 and E 2 that likely located {{at or near the}} interface of the E 1 E 2 complex, and determined that the E 2 <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> also {{plays an important role in}} E 1 E 2 complex formation. The conformation-dependent reactivity of CD 81 and the antibody panel to the E 1 E 2 mutant library provides a global view of the influence of each amino acid (aa) on E 1 E 2 expression and folding.
