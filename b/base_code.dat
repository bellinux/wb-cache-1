5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own <b>base</b> <b>code</b> libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert started {{programming}} Maniac Mansion in 6502 assembly language, but {{he quickly}} decided that the project was too large and complex for this method. He decided that a new game engine {{would have to be}} created. Its coding language was initially planned to be LISP-inspired, but Gilbert opted for one similar to C. Lucasfilm employee Chip Morningstar contributed the <b>base</b> <b>code</b> for the engine, which Gilbert then built on. Gilbert hoped to create a [...] "system that could be used on many adventure games, cutting down the time it took to make them". Maniac Mansions first six-to-nine months of production were dedicated largely to engine development. The game was developed around the Commodore 64 home computer, an 8-bit system with only 64 KB of memory. The team wanted to include scrolling screens, but as it was normally impossible to scroll bitmap graphics on the Commodore 64, they had to utilize lower-detail tile graphics. Winnick gave each character a large head made of three stacked sprites to make them recognizable.|$|E

As the 4th season begins where season 3 ended, the future seems bleak: Weir is {{incapacitated}} and the {{senior members of the}} expedition have suffered multiple injuries. With the city damaged, running out of power and drifting in space, cut off from Earth, the Atlantis expedition raids Asuras to obtain a ZPM and is able to travel to a nearby planet. Weir is captured by the Asurans and Colonel Samantha Carter joins as a regular and acts as the expedition leader. She appears in the episode [...] "Lifeline" [...] after helping to find and land Atlantis on its new home planet; she is then ordered back to the SGC. In episode 3, under the IOA's orders, Carter returns to Atlantis as the new leader of the expedition after Atlantis lands. The season focuses on the main antagonists: the Asurans and the Wraith, as well as the pregnancy of Teyla Emmagan. The Asuran <b>base</b> <b>code</b> is reprogrammed by McKay, leading the nanobots to fulfill the purpose for which the Ancients created them: to wipe out the Wraith. Midway through the season, they are seemingly destroyed, and the remaining episodes concentrate mainly on Michael's efforts against both humans and the other Wraith.|$|E

Two of them are biologically inspired spike <b>based</b> <b>coding</b> systems i. e. the spikes are generated {{in a similar way}} to how our auditory nerves generate spikes.

A related event <b>based</b> <b>coding</b> technique has been developed by Koickal and the sounds have been re-generated from spikes generated by Koickal's spike coding technique and the results are compared. Our brain does not reconstruct sound from the spikes received from auditory nerves, it interprets it.

5000|$|The Asuran <b>base</b> <b>code</b> is the {{collection}} of millions of commands that underlie Asuran behaviors, encoded in over three billion chemical base pair sequences. Amongst these directives are codes for aggression, for attacking the Wraith, against harming the Ancients, and against mimicking the appearance of known persons. Updates to the <b>base</b> <b>code</b> are disseminated periodically to all Asurans in {{a process known as}} a [...] "merge". Rodney McKay of the Atlantis Expedition modifies the Asuran <b>base</b> <b>code</b> in , , and , in the process inadvertently allowing the Asurans to override several of these directives. There is a central data core on Asuras that serves as a [...] "back-up hard drive" [...] for the <b>base</b> <b>code.</b> If destroyed, an Asuran's physical body can be reconstituted using data from the collective. Isolated Asuran nanites are vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, but in sufficient numbers they are able to assimilate organic components to protect themselves. The most effective weapon against individual Asurans is the Replicator disruptor, which disintegrates an Asuran by disrupting the link between its component nanites. However, the Asurans will eventually adapt and immunize themselves to the disruptor given enough exposure, and in [...] they take the strategy of repeatedly sacrificing their number to a Replicator disruptor field so as to gather the required data.|$|E

40|$|Packet losses {{decrease}} {{the quality of}} an image or video for multimedia applications. Robust image coding is crucial to combat packet losses, for transmission of images over non feedback networks. New CS <b>based</b> image <b>coding</b> schemes are robust against packet losses and carries CS samples of nearly equal importance. CS <b>based</b> <b>coding</b> also ensures low costs and complexity for image sensing. Hence CS <b>based</b> image <b>coding</b> techniques have some distinct advantages over traditional Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques and Multiple Description <b>Coding</b> (MDC) <b>based</b> methods. Forward error Correction techniques are generally employed along with some transform <b>based</b> <b>coding,</b> but provides a limited error resilience. MDC methods {{are considered to be}} one of the widely used mechanisms for packet losses. Compressive sensing based methods are an alternate to MDC and are able to provide robust image coding against packet losses with large number of descriptions.

The aim of the paper is to give a brief introduction to all the above techniques and survey four different CS <b>based</b> image <b>coding</b> techniques.
