The government functions (health, education, safety, management, environment, sanitation, housing, etc) are instances of public policy operationalizations. The goal of this investigation is to assess the performance of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>execution</b> per government functions of the States and the Federal District, in 2013, {{with the use of the}} Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in order to develop an index and establish a performance ranking. The administrative efficiency is the criterion used to assess the performance of the States and the Federal District.

Twenty-six government functions, as variables of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>execution,</b> were included in the assessment. The results revealed, based on the General Performance Index (IGD) created by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that the State of Acre, the Federal District and the Amapá obtained the first positions in the performance ranking of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>execution</b> per government functions in 2013.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWithin the Department of Defense, funds are appropriated and budget authority is issued; resources are then executed accordingly. However, higher priority adjustments occur due to unintended and looming threats and needs. The abilities granted {{through the use}} of reprogramming allow for the shifting of funds within and among programs. Thus, service effectiveness in the execution of funding can be enhanced or reduced by the latitude granted to the defense department in its ability to reprogram funds. Several methods of analysis, such as the measures of central tendency and the measures of dispersion, are applied supportive of reprogramming effectiveness. Through these methods this thesis tests the Marine Corps’ effectiveness in its role of <b>budgetary</b> <b>execution</b> {{through the use of}} reprogramming activities for a 10 -year period from 2005 to 2014.

40|$|Public {{institutions}} of {{lower secondary education}} are financed mainly from the public resources allocated from the local budget. Expenditures incurred from these resources have a maximum limit and a destination {{set out in the}} budget of each educational unit. The revenue and expenditure budget or only the expenditure budget of a lower secondary education institution provides for the maximum amounts to be used for the expenses made throughout a budgetary exercise. Therefore, reducing the share of social security contributions from your employer by five percentage points would affect the budget of such institutions as it would lead to a modification of the social insurance contributions expenses. In this paper we have described the structure of the current expenditure of a lower secondary education institution, especially with regard to staff expenses, because they hold the largest share in the total expenditure constantly incurred by the units concerned and are affected by the social security rate change. We have also presented the theoretical aspects related to the staff expenses, the <b>budgetary</b> <b>execution</b> phases that staff expenses must cover, the accounting treatment of costs of employers' social insurance contributions, the recognition of employers’ expenses for the social insurance State contributions in the bookkeeping of lower secondary education institutions, as well as the influence of changes in rates of the social security State contributions from the employer on the staff expenditure of the institutions mentioned...|$|E

It means, in the same time, creating a system designed to distribute equitably and rationally public money between educational units, and careful control of its expenditure. The educational system’s modernization also implies raising the control and intervention capacity of the decision factors on local and central levels as well as the correction of some errors or the removal of dysfunctionalities in budgetary planning and execution. Our study was founded on a survey type of scientific research, made on 50 preuniversitary educational institutions from Sibiu.

A través de nuestra investigación determinamos que, no todos los proyectos que se plantearon en el POA fueron realizados. Los funcionarios de la Empresa atribuyeron esta falta de ejecución de proyectos al hecho de no haber recibido la transferencia de la ANT, sin embargo, estetrabajo de titulación demuestra que estos proyectos pudieron ser ejecutados con el superávit presupuestario.

In this way, we will improve the management carried out by EMOV EP. Through our research, we determined that not all the projects suggested by POA were completed. The civil servants of the Company attributed this lack of implementation of projects to the factthat the transfer of the ANT was not received. However, this thesis demonstrates that these projects could be implemented through the budget surplus. If we had made continuous monitoring of the budget, we would have determined that the current revenues were in credit. Since the accrual was higher than codified, we have a surplus which could cover projects that were running out of finance because the transfer was not received. Contadora Pública AuditoraCuenc...|$|E

Starting from the premise that public sector intervention in water resources policy is essential and mandatory due to the need of managing conflicts and major investments, government planning and evaluating their actions become decisive factors for the successful management these resources. From this rationale, this study sought to analyze the development of the Water Resources of the State of CearÃ policy observing the execution of the State budget in the period 1995 - 2012 on the political context, the involvement of funding agencies, major products delivered infrastructure, studies, projects and periods of drought.

Also, we have not finished leaving the "digital revolution" and already {{we are in the}} middle of the "revolution of the knowledge", where the possibility of creating wealth and of improving the quality of society life that depends more and more on the capacity to generate, to incorporate, to adapt, to use and to disperse scientific and technological knowledge Meanwhile, the present Peruvian scene is characterized to face such events of a little encouraging way: We are immersed in the process of globalization of the economy, negotiating Free Trade Agreement with the U. S. A., without being convinced to obtain benefits balances in the future commercial transactions. We are in front of a decentralization process, for which several laws have been approved (Law of Bases of the Decentralization, Statutory law of Regional Governments and Statutory law of Municipalities), that do not establish a clear distribution of competitions between the three levels of government, projecting therefore a little clear vision on where it takes the decentralization process to us; and we are entering to the "society of the knowledge" of unequal way and left behind, result of the lamentable policies of science and technology that have turned out insufficient to confront the enormous challenges that today the globalizated world imposes, so is thus, that just we counted on a Law Frame of Science, technology and Innovation from July of the 2004 and for the first time in Peru, in January of the 2006 is formulated Strategic the National Plan of Science, Technology and Innovation for the competitiveness and Human Development (NPSTI) of long term, with projection to year 2021. Particularly, the non-transferable character of end items of the industry of the construction: works, apparently make less easy that the phenomenon of the globalization reaches to this sector; nevertheless, the activities related to the evaluation of projects, design, execution, supervision and/or concession of works (in the single case), they are possible of being internationalized. In this context, the Peruvian State must be prepared to face this great commercial challenge and the modern companies, without size distinction, must be able to compete beyond the national scope, because the global economy demands permanent innovation, crescents productivity levels and competitiveness, and a quality concept that includes all the aspects of the companies. The Peruvian State annually invests around $ 1200 million dollars in execution and public work consultancy, which approximately means a 8 % of total the public cost and a 23 % of the acquisitions and public hirings. Therefore, considering which the construction hits directly in the quality of life and the capacity of the country to produce goods and services, it turns out fundamental to constantly look for new alternatives that allow to make better works, to save resources, to increase the productivity to benefit thus to the greater possible amount of the population. In this context, the technological management acquires a preponderant paper, but paradoxically, our country has been characterized by one reduced activity in investigation, innovation and transference of technology, and as it is obvious the construction sector does not get rid of this lamentable situation. The numbers inverted in investigation and development are lower to the 0, 1 % of the PBI ($ 64. 5 million dollars year 2005). One of the reasons for these indices is the risks of financing of the technological innovation, assumed generally by the company or organization that carries out them. Thus, it is of vital importance of reformulating the paper of the State in this matter, of way to fortify and to impel the suitable investigation, transference and technological innovation. Of such situation, the intention of the present thesis, consists of giving proposals of improvement of the management of process to assure the quality public works, as result of an analysis and diagnostic made within the actual legal frame and the organization resources of the state sector and the private sector involved in the hirings and acquisitions of the Peruvian State. In chapter I, the conceptual frame appears, where the organized resources are determined that they are going to be considered during the {{development of}} the thesis, also is defined that it is a project of public investment and meanwhile types of <b>budgetary</b> <b>execution</b> can execute public works. In chapter II, the main impacts and consequences of the actual legal normativity in the final quality of public works are determined. From chapter III to chapter VII indicated, the main limitations, deficiencies and the requirements related to financial, material, human, administrative of supervision, that influence in the final quality of public works. Of the analysis conducted in the previous chapters, generated listing of problems, from which, it would be difficult to extract a group reduced of them without perhaps but important problems are outside the relation; therefore, the use of a method of first priorization of listings denominated matrix of selection of problems was essential, which was applied with the additional collaboration of compatible professionals to the consultancy and work execution (architects and engineers of diverse specialties). The group dynamics consisted of which each member of the equipment gives a score to each critic evaluated in the problems. Once gave this score, the arithmetic average of them is considered and the total by each problem is obtained, with which the group individual or subjective evaluation becomes collective. The 4 problems that obtained the highest score are those than they have been considered to develop the proposals of the thesis. Finally in chapter 8, the procedure explained in previous paragraph is outlines and the 4 main proposals of improvement of the management of process appear to assure the quality public works that have been developed on the base of opinions spilled by professionals understood in these subjects, surveys of opinion to consultants and work executors, experiences made in others countries and following while it is applicable, the lineaments indicated in the Guide of Interpretation of the PTC-ISO 9001 - 2001 for the Construction Sector and the Methodology Guide of Management of Projects for Construction Sector. I hope that this developed thesis to choose the degree of Teacher in Enterprise Technological management, applied to the problematic that I have experimented professionally as work executor and consultant of public works, contribute in effective form to the maintained growth of the country and to the generation of one better quality of life of the Peruvian population and conservation of the environment. TesisEl vertiginoso desarrollo de la ciencia y la tecnología a nivel mundial, ha impulsado los asombrosos cambios y avances en las áreas de informática y telecomunicaciones que han contribuido indefectiblemente con la internacionalización de los mercados, a tal punto, que estamos próximos a una globalizada de los mismos y por ende a la globalización de las economías. Asimismo, no hemos terminado de salir de la revolución digital y ya estamos en medio de la revolución del conocimiento, donde la posibilidad de crear riqueza y de mejorar la calidad de vida de la sociedad depende cada vez más de la capacidad de generar, incorporar, adaptar, utilizar y dispersar conocimientos científicos y tecnológicos. Mientras tanto, el escenario peruano actual se caracteriza por enfrentar tales acontecimientos de una manera poco alentadora: Estamos inmersos en el proceso de globalización de la economía, negociando tratados de libre comercio con EE. UU., sin estar convencidos de obtener beneficios equilibrados en las futuras transacciones comerciales. Estamos frente a un proceso de descentralización, para el cual se han aprobado varias leyes (Ley de Bases de la Descentralización, Ley Orgánica de Gobiernos Regionales y Ley Orgánica de Municipalidades), que no establecen una clara distribución de competencias entre los tres niveles de gobierno, proyectando así una visión poco clara sobre adónde nos lleva el proceso de descentralización; y estamos ingresando a la sociedad del conocimiento de manera desigual y rezagada, resultado de las lamentables políticas de ciencia y tecnología que han resultado insuficientes para afrontar los enormes desafíos que hoy nos impone el mundo globalizado, tal es así, que recién contamos con una Ley Marco de Ciencia, tecnología e Innovación desde Julio del 2004 y por primera vez en el Perú, en Enero del 2006 se formula el Plan Nacional Estratégico de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación para la competitividad y Desarrollo Humano (PNCTI) de largo plazo, con proyección al año 2021. Particularmente, el carácter no transferible de los productos finales de la industria de la construcción: obras, aparentemente hace menos fácil que el fenómeno de la globalización alcance a este sector; sin embargo, las actividades relacionadas con la evaluación de proyectos, diseño, ejecución, supervisión y/o concesión de obras (por si solas), si son posibles de ser internacionalizadas. En este contexto, el Estado Peruano debe prepararse para enfrentar este gran reto comercial y las empresas modernas, sin distinción de tamaño, deben ser capaces de competir más allá del ámbito nacional, ya que la economía global reclama permanente innovación, crecientes niveles de productividad y competitividad, y un concepto de calidad que abarque todos los aspectos de las empresas. El Estado Peruano invierte anualmente alrededor de $ 1200 millones de dólares en ejecución y consultoría de obras públicas, lo que significa aproximadamente un 8 % del gasto público total y un 23 % de las adquisiciones y contrataciones públicas. Por lo tanto, considerando que la construcción impacta directamente en la calidad de vida y en la capacidad del país para producir bienes y servicios, resulta primordial buscar constantemente nuevas alternativas que permitan realizar mejores obras, ahorrar recursos, aumentar la productividad para beneficiar así a la mayor cantidad posible de la población. En este contexto, la gestión tecnológica adquiere un papel preponderante, pero paradójicamente, nuestro país se ha caracterizado por una reducida actividad en investigación, innovación y transferencia de tecnología, y como es obvio el sector construcción no se libra de esta lamentable situación. Las cifras invertidas en investigación y desarrollo son inferiores al 0. 1 % del PBI ($ 64. 5 millones de dólares el año 2005). Uno de los motivos de estos índices son los riesgos de financiamiento de la innovación tecnológica, generalmente asumidos por la empresa u organización que las lleva a cabo. Así, es de vital importancia reformular el papel del Estado en esta materia, de manera de fortalecer e impulsar la adecuada investigación, transferencia e innovación tecnológica. En tal situación, el propósito de la presente tesis consiste en dar propuestas de mejoramiento de la gestión de procesos para asegurar la calidad de las obras públicas, como resultado de un análisis y diagnóstico realizado dentro del marco legal vigente y los recursos organizacionales del sector estatal y del sector privado involucrados en las contrataciones y adquisiciones del Estado peruano. En el capítulo 1, se presenta el marco conceptual, donde se determinan los recursos organizacionales que van a ser considerados durante el desarrollo de la tesis, asimismo se define que es un proyecto de inversión pública y bajo qué tipos de ejecución presupuestal pueden ejecutarse las obras públicas. En el capítulo 2, se determinan los principales impactos y consecuencias de la normatividad legal vigente en la calidad final de las obras públicas. Desde el capítulo 3 hasta el capítulo 7, se indican las principales limitaciones, carencias y los requerimientos relacionados con los recursos financieros, materiales, humanos, administrativos y de supervisión, que influyen en la calidad final de las obras públicas. Del análisis efectuado en los capítulos anteriores, se generó un listado de problemas, de los cuales, resultaría difícil extraer un grupo reducido de ellos sin que problemas quizá más importantes queden fuera de la relación; por lo tanto, fue imprescindible el empleo de un método de priorización de listados denominado matriz de selección de problemas, el cual fue aplicado con la colaboración adicional de profesionales afines a la consultoría y ejecución de obras (arquitectos e ingenieros de diversas especialidades). La dinámica grupal consistió en que cada miembro del equipo otorgue una puntuación a cada criterio evaluado en los problemas. Una vez otorgada dicha puntuación, se considera el promedio aritmético de ellos y se obtiene la sumatoria total por cada problema, con lo que se convierte la evaluación individual o subjetiva en colectiva o grupal. Los 4 problemas que obtuvieron la puntuación más alta son los que se han considerado para desarrollar las propuestas de la tesis. Por último en el capítulo 8, se esquematiza el procedimiento explicado en el párrafo anterior y se presentan las 4 principales propuestas de mejoramiento de la gestión de procesos para asegurar la calidad de las obras públicas, que se han desarrollado sobre la base de opiniones vertidas por profesionales entendidos en estos temas, encuestas de opinión a consultores y ejecutores de obra, experiencias realizadas en otros países y siguiendo, mientras sea aplicable, los lineamientos señalados en la Guía de Interpretación de la NTP-ISO 9001 : 2001 para el Sector Construcción y la Guía Metodológica de Gerencia de Proyectos para el Sector Construcción. Espero que esta tesis desarrollada para optar el grado de Maestro en Gestión Tecnológica Empresarial, aplicada a la problemática que he experimentado profesionalmente como ejecutor y consultor de obras públicas, contribuyan en forma efectiva con el crecimiento sostenido del país y con la generación de una mejor calidad de vida de la población peruana y conservación del medio ambiente...|$|E
