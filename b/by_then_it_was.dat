5|$|For their part, the Sassanids {{struggled}} {{to establish a}} stable government. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius' ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrow's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrow II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late to rescue the Sassanid kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Other attractions {{that closed}} {{at about the}} same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and the miniature railway. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E

5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late in the day to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Bull's station {{building}} {{burned down}} in 1914 {{and was replaced}} two year later by a new. <b>By</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided that the line past Lysaker would be upgraded and Lysaker became {{the first of many}} stations on the line to be designed as an elevated station. The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway designed for double-track operation. The new station was designed in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E
5|$|F. Augustus Heinze's {{association}} with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved {{too much for the}} board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, he {{reconciled}} with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris. The same year, he issued the poetry book De nos oiseaux ("Of Our Birds").

In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of Le Cœur à barbe, starring Breton and other leading Surrealists. Five years later, he signed his name to The Testimony against Gertrude Stein, published by Eugene Jolas's magazine transition in reply to Stein's memoir The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, in which he accused his former friend of being a megalomaniac.|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught sight of the ships, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late.|$|E
5|$|The battleground {{proved to}} be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was {{considered}} most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was Denver, Colorado.|$|E

5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, the Turkish troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, the Turkish force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the Turkish troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. <b>By</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> getting dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops.|$|E
