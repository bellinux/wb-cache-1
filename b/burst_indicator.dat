40|$|International audienceRock burst {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{failures}} in hard rock mining and civil construction. This study focuses on the prediction of rock burst classification with case instances using cloud models and attribution weight. First, cloud models are introduced briefly related to the rock burst classification problem. Then, the attribution weight method is presented to quantify the contribution of each rock <b>burst</b> <b>indicator</b> for classification. The approach is implemented to predict the classes of rock burst intensity for the 164 rock burst instances collected. The clustering figures are generated by cloud models for each rock burst class. The computed weight values of the indicators show that the stress ratio Ts=σθ/σc is the most vulnerable parameter and the elastic strain energy storage index W et and the brittleness factor B=σc/σt take the second and third place, respectively, contributing to the rock burst classification. Besides, the predictive performance of the strategy introduced in this study is compared with that of some empirical methods, the regression analysis, the neural networks and support vector machines. The results turn out that cloud models perform better than the empirical methods and regression analysis and have superior generalization ability than the neural networks in modelling the rock burst cases. Hence, cloud models are feasible and applicable for prediction of rock burst classification. Finally, different models with varying indicators are investigated to validate the parameter sensitivity results obtained by cloud clustering analysis and regression analysis in context to rock burst classification...|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} described flow cytometric opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) {{was adapted}} {{to quantify the}} functional activity of serum antibodies specifically directed against serogroup B inner core lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Neisseria meningitidis. The percentage of human peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes (PMNms) ingesting fluorescently labeled, ethanol-fixed N. meningitidis organisms (phagocytic activity) {{in the presence of}} human sera was measured to reflect the serum opsonic activity against the bacterium. The contribution to opsonophagocytic activity of antibodies to inner core LPS was estimated by comparing the opsonic activities of adult and infant sera before and after adsorbing anti-LPS antibodies from the sera using purified LPS extracted from an LPS mutant (galE) of N. meningitidis strain MC 58 (B: 15 :P 1. 7, 16 :L 3). The specificity of the assay was further investigated using monoclonal antibody (MAb) B 5, which binds to an inner core LPS epitope of N. meningitidis. A dose-dependent decrease in phagocytic activity was observed when MAb B 5 was incubated with LPS from an inner core LPS (galE) mutant. Similarly, the number of PMNms ingesting fluorescently labeled polystyrene beads coated with inner core (galE) LPS decreased in a dose-dependent fashion when MAb B 5 was incubated with various concentrations of the homologous inner core LPS. Strong correlations were found between the concentration of serum antibodies to inner core LPS (galE) versus the phagocytic activity using healthy adult sera (r 2 = 0. 89). There was a correlation between phagocytic ingestion and initiation of intracellular oxidative burst (r 2 = 0. 99) using polystyrene beads coated with inner core LPS and opsonized with the same sera using the oxidative <b>burst</b> <b>indicator</b> system dihydrorhodamine 123 /rhodamine 123. OPA results were also found to correlate closely with the results of the serum bactericidal assay using MAb B 5 against the N. meningitidis MC 58 galE mutant in the presence of human complement (r 2 = 0. 994, P = 0. 003, two-tailed test). These studies demonstrate that functional antibodies are produced in humans against meningococcal inner core LPS and that the OPA is a useful approach to study the opsonic activity of antibodies to inner core LPS in health and disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} is {{the gateway}} for visual {{information}} {{en route to the}} visual cortex. Neural activity is characterized by the existence of 2 firing modes: burst and tonic. Originally associated with sleep, bursts have now been postulated {{to be a part of}} the normal visual response, structured to increase the probability of cortical activation, able to act as a wake-up call to the cortex. We investigated a potential role for burst in the detection of novel stimuli by recording neuronal activity in the LGN of behaving monkeys during a visual detection task. Our results show that bursts are often the neuron’s first response, and are more numerous in the response to attended target stimuli than to unattended distractor stimuli. <b>Bursts</b> are <b>indicators</b> of the task novelty, as repetition decreased bursting. Because the primary visual cortex is the major modulatory input to the LGN, we compared the results obtained in control conditions with those observed when cortical activity was reduced by TMS. This cortical deactivation reduced visual response related bursting by 90 %. These results highlight a novel role for the thalamus, able to code higher order image attributes as important as novelty early in the thalamo-cortical conversation...|$|R
40|$|Several gamma-ray <b>burst</b> (GRB) {{luminosity}} <b>indicators</b> {{have been}} proposed, {{which can be}} generally written {{in the form of}} ˆ L = c ∏ x ai i, where c is the coefficient, xi is the i-th observable, and ai is its corresponding power-law index. Unlike Type-Ia supernovae, calibration of GRB luminosity indicators using a low-redshift sample is difficult. This is because the GRB rate drops rapidly at low redshifts, and more importantly, some nearby GRBs appear to be different from their cosmological brethren. Based on the Bayesian theory, here we propose an approach to calibrate the GRB luminosity indicators without introducing a low-redshift GRB sample. The essential points of our approach include, (1) calibrate {ai} with a sample of GRBs in a narrow redshift range (∆z); and (2) marginalize the c value over a reasonable range of cosmological parameters.

40|$|Modern European {{identity}} {{is built around}} two types of cleavages revealed {{in the beginning of}} the XIX century: fraternity and conflict. The meanings and the different readings of these two themes of the democratic modernity provide by themselves an accurate image of the period in question. For Central and South-eastern Europe, these two <b>indicators</b> <b>burst</b> into the political scenery and in the political thought at the same period, under the significant impact of the French Revolution. This article is tracking the main paradigm changes produced in the political thought in this part of Europe, especially in the Romanian Principalities, interpreted trough the lenses of civic aggregation and the creation of civil society. Individuals are more and more defined as holding a double existence, as public markers and private entities; this fresh perspective accompanies the expression of either tolerance (accompanied by an auto-critical perspective) or antagonism (of class, race, religion, civilization in a more general matter of speaking) and they are at the ground foundation of modern political system...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of renormalization-group improved cosmologies, we analyze both theoretically and observationally the exact and general solution of the matter-dominated cosmological equations, by using {{the expression of the}} cosmological term {{as a function of the}} Newton parameter already determined by the integration method employed in a previous paper. A rough comparison between such a model and the concordance LambdaCDM model from the point of view of the magnitude-redshift relationship has been already considered, without showing any appreciable differences. Here we test our model by using astrophysical data (the Union 2 type Ia supernovae (SNIa) dataset, the Hubble diagram constructed from some gamma ray <b>bursts</b> luminosity distance <b>indicator),</b> to constrain its parameters. We also apply a cosmographic approach to our cosmological model. In order to estimate the cosmographic parameters we fit a large dataset, including not only the Hubble diagram, as traced by SNIa and gamma ray bursts, but also the H(z) measurements from passively evolving galaxies, baryon acoustic oscillations and the distance priors from the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy spectrum. We show that this matter-dominated cosmological model with variable Newton parameter and variable cosmological term is indeed compatible with the observations above. The cosmographic approach adopted confirms such conclusions. Last, it seems possible to include radiation into the model, since numerical integration of the equations derived by the presence of both radiation and matter shows that, after inflation, the total density parameter is initially dominated by the radiation contribution and later by the matter one...|$|R

Based on the Bayesian theory, here we propose {{an approach to}} calibrate these LIs without introducing a low-redshift GRB sample. The essential points of our approach include, (1) calibrate the power-law indices in the LIs {{with a sample of}} GRBs in a narrow redshift range (Delta z); and (2) marginalize the coefficient of the LIs over a reasonable range of cosmological parameters. We take our newly discovered multivariable GRB LIs as an example and test the validity of our approach through simulations. We show that while the coefficient strongly depends on the cosmological parameters, the power-law indices do not as long as Delta z is small enough. The selection of Delta z for a particular GRB sample could be judged according to the size and the observational uncertainty of the sample. There is no preferable redshift to perform the calibration of the indices, while a lower redshift is preferable for the marginalization of the coefficient. The best strategy would be to collect GRBs within a narrow redshift bin around a fiducial intermediate redshift (e. g. z~ 1 or z~ 2), since the observed GRB redshift distribution is found to peak around z=(1 - 2. 5). Our simulation suggests that with the current observational precision of measuring GRB isotropic energy, spectral break energy, and the optical temporal break time, 25 GRBs within a redshift bin of Delta z ~ 0. 30 would give fine calibration to our luminosity indicator(abridged) ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{excellent}} angular {{resolution of the}} Chandra X-ray Observatory, {{it is possible to}} geometrically determine the distance to variable Galactic sources, based on the phenomenon that scattered radiation appearing in the X-ray halo has to travel along a slightly longer path than the direct, unscattered radiation. By measuring the delayed variability, constraints on the source distance can be obtained if the halo brightness is large enough to dominate the point spread function (PSF) and to provide sufficient statistics. The distance to Cyg X- 3, which has a quasi-sinusoidal light curve, has been obtained with this approach by Predehl et al. Here we examine the feasibility of using the delayed signature of type I X-ray <b>bursts</b> as distance <b>indicators.</b> We use simulations of delayed X-ray burst light curves in the halo to find that the optimal annular region and energy band for a distance measurement with a grating observation is roughly 10 - 50 " and 1 - 5 keV respectively, assuming Chandra's effective area and PSF, uniformly distributed dust, the input spectrum and optical depth to GX 13 + 1, and the Weingartner & Draine interstellar grain model. We find that the statistics are dominated by Poisson noise rather than systematic uncertainties, e. g., the PSF contribution to the halo. Using Chandra, a distance measurement to such a source at 4 (8) kpc could be made to about 23 % (30 %) accuracy with a single burst with 68 % confidence. By stacking many bursts, a reasonable estimate of systematic errors limit the distance measurement to about 10 % accuracy. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures; Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|The {{explanation}} of the accelerated expansion of the Universe poses {{one of the most}} fundamental questions in physics and cosmology today. If the acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, one can try to constrain the parameters using a cosmographic approach. Our high-redshift analysis allows us to put constraints on the cosmographic expansion up to the fifth order. It is based on the Union 2 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set, the Hubble diagram constructed from some Gamma Ray <b>Bursts</b> luminosity distance <b>indicators,</b> and gaussian priors on the distance from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Hubble constant h (these priors have been included in order to help break the degeneracies among model parameters). To perform our statistical analysis and to explore the probability distributions of the cosmographic parameters we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (MCMC). We finally investigate implications of our results for the dark energy, in particular, we focus on the parametrization of the dark energy equation of state (EOS). Actually, a possibility to investigate the nature of dark energy lies in measuring the dark energy equation of state, w, and its time (or redshift) dependence at high accuracy. However, since w(z) is not directly accessible to measurement, reconstruction methods are needed to extract it reliably from observations. Here we investigate different models of dark energy, described through several parametrizations of the equation of state, by comparing the cosmographic and the EOS series.

40|$|The {{explanation}} of the accelerated expansion of the Universe poses {{one of the most}} fundamental questions in physics and cosmology today. If the acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, {{and in the absence of}} a well-based theory to interpret the observations, one can try to constrain the parameters describing the kinematical state of the universe using a cosmographic approach, which is fundamental in that it requires only a minimal set of assumptions, namely to specify the metric, and it does not rely on the dynamical equations for gravity. Our high-redshift analysis allows us to put constraints on the cosmographic expansion up to the fifth order.
