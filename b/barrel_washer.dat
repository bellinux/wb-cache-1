5000|$|One {{common design}} is the [...] "rod squeegee", and {{consists}} of a hinge-mounted rubber disc {{on the end of}} a plastic rod of sufficient length to reach the full length of the <b>barrel.</b> The rubber <b>washer</b> end is inserted sideways into the barrel, pushed to the bottom and subsequently withdrawn with the rubber disc rotated ninety degrees (so that the disc now touches the inner circumference of the barrel and scrapes the paint out). Such designs often place the hinged disk on an inner cable or rod that is manipulated by a trigger at the other end; by pulling the trigger, the disk is forced to rotate into contact with the barrel surface.|$|R
