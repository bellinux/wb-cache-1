5|$|Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism {{was brought}} to Japan from Baekje, new styles of shrine {{architecture}} were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples {{as a place of}} assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temple</b> architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the Theravada <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temples,</b> societies in Malaysia as well as their devotees, focusing on the process of the formation of the multi-ethnic Theravada Buddhist community. In Malaysia, many of the Theravada <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temples</b> have a long history with various memberships of Sangha comprising monks from Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. On the other hand, the devotees of almost all Theravada <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temples</b> are predominantly English educated Chinese or English-speaking Chinese. The Theravada <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temples,</b> despite retention of cultural legacies of Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, carry out manifold activities in their own way and styles. This paper examines how the Sangha membership and the Chinese participants have engaged in developing Theravada <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temples</b> in cooperation with each other, focusing in particular on the <b>temples</b> and <b>Buddhist</b> societies of Sri Lankan tradition. The Sri Lankan Theravada <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temples</b> and societies tend to provide Dhamma and humanitarian services to the public; {{at the same time they}} tend to adopt customs and styles of their Chinese devotees. It is in this way that they become indigenised and form a distinctive socio-religious community. This research will demonstrate how the Buddhists of the Theravada tradition organize their community and how multi-ethnic participants interact with each other in that process. セッション 2 エスニック要素と宗教実践、そして宗教コミュニティ形成の文化交...|$|R
5|$|Buddhism {{first entered}} China during the Eastern Han and was first {{mentioned}} in 65 AD. Liu Ying (d.71 AD), a half-brother to Emperor Ming of Han (r.57–75 AD), {{was one of}} its earliest Chinese adherents, although Chinese Buddhism at this point was heavily associated with Huang-Lao Daoism. China's first known <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temple,</b> the White Horse Temple, was constructed outside {{the wall of the}} capital, Luoyang, during Emperor Ming's reign. Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD, including the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters, Perfection of Wisdom, Shurangama Sutra, and Pratyutpanna Sutra.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, Angkor Wat was not {{completely}} abandoned and functioned as a <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temple.</b> Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify to Japanese Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which originally located {{in the kingdom of}} Magadha, India. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondafu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor Wat in 1632.|$|E

Conversely, Yichang was largely irreligious, although after surviving an encounter with a tiger, gave offerings to the gods in thanks. According to Mao's account, Yichang was a staunch disciplinarian, and would beat his children as punishment for disobedience and a perceived lack of filial piety, with Mao describing the beating he received on one occasion when he humiliated his father in public. He added that his mother would often try to protect her children from these beatings.|$|E

The abbess' ashes were kept for 100days at her temple, before making their way to her final resting place in Zhejiang {{province}} in China, where her niece lives. As a follow-up to her funeral, her remains and personal items were put on one-day public display at her temple on 26 February 2006. The relics (Sariras) displayed were crystalline or pearl-like deposits found in Venerable Ho's ashes. Buddhists believe these are usually found in cremated Buddhist masters, are holy, and treat them with reverence.|$|E

5|$|State Shinto {{was heavily}} {{emphasised}} in the 1930s {{as a means}} to promote Japanese nationalism and acculturalisation of Palauans to Japanese norms. A few shrines were built around Palau during the 1930s. Of particular note was the completion of the Taisha Nanyo Jinja (transliterally the Great Southern Shrine) in November 1940 at Koror, which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia. Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily emphasised, which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor. Shinto, Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions, and the first <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temple</b> in Palau was erected in 1926, mainly to cater to the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers. Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in Palau.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{emerged in}} the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar {{immigrant}} who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, {{a few members of}} Senshin <b>Buddhist</b> <b>Temple</b> in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976 and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.|$|E

At the <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temple</b> she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August 1963, Tung's men, {{acting on}} Nhu's orders, raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda, Saigon's main <b>Buddhist</b> <b>temple.</b> The attacks were {{replicated}} across the nation, leaving a death toll {{estimated to be}} in the hundreds. The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400 monks and nuns were arrested. The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare martial law. He knew the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country. Following the attacks, U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the special forces unless they were used to fight communists rather than attacking political or religious dissidents.|$|E
