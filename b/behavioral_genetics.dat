5|$|Irving Isadore Gottesman (December 29, 1930 – June 29, 2016) was an American {{professor}} of psychology who devoted {{most of his career}} {{to the study of the}} genetics of schizophrenia. He wrote 17 books and more than 290 other publications, mostly on schizophrenia and <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics,</b> and created the first academic program on <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics</b> in the United States. He won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research. Lastly, Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D.|$|E
5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics</b> being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E
5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics</b> and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman {{began his}} career at Harvard University as a social {{relations}} and psychology lecturer. This non-tenure-track position ended after three years. Then he worked with researcher James Shields at the Maudsley–Bethlem hospital complex in London, using its twin registry to analyze traits of identical and fraternal twins at the lab of Eliot Slater, whom Gottesman met in Rome at the Second International Congress on Human Genetics in 1961. After {{his return to the}} University of Minnesota in 1966, Gottesman created a program on <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics,</b> the first in the U.S. In 1972–1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with K.O.

25|$|Some critics view {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a form}} of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that {{evolutionary psychology}} does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics</b> is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{models can}} {{certainly}} {{be useful to}} find out more about the biological bases of anxiety disorders and develop new, more efficient pharmacological and/or behavioral treatments. However, many of the current “models of anxiety” in animals do not deal with pathology itself, but only with extreme forms of anxiety which are still in the normal, adaptive range. These models have certainly provided a lot of information on brain and behavioral mechanisms which could be involved in the etiology and physiopathology of anxiety disorders, but are usually not satisfactory when confronted directly with clinical syndromes. Further progress in this field will probably depend on the finding of endophenotypes which can be studied in both humans and animals with common methodological approaches. The emphasis should be on individual differences in vulnerability, which have to be included in animal models. Finally, progress will also depend on refining theoretical constructs from an interdisciplinary perspective, including psychiatry, psychology, <b>behavioral</b> sciences, <b>genetics,</b> and other neurosciences...|$|R
500|$|In the Denmark study, the {{researchers}} evaluated {{the extent to}} which genes underpin psychopathology. Their twin studies of criminality found that a genetic disposition to poor self-control caused both identical twins to become felons, or to not become felons. They also studied identical twins who were discordant for schizophrenia, where one twin was schizophrenic and the other not, and found children of such twins had equal genetic vulnerability to the disease. A later study in the mid-1980s, resulting in a paper awarded the Kurt Schneider Prize, concluded that children of identical twins were at higher risk than those of fraternal twins, indicating the non-schizophrenic identical twin passed on a latent genetic disposition, even {{if it had not been}} expressed through schizoida. [...] The Denmark study introduced the concepts of [...] "unexpressed genotypes"the latent genetic risk, and [...] "epigenetic control"the biochemical regulation of how genes work, into the new field of <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Dr. Kurt Benirschke, a Professor of Reproductive Medicine and Pathology at the University of California, San Diego, became {{chairman}} of the university's advisory committee to the Zoological Society dealing with research and animal reproduction.

In 1975 Benirschke and then-San Diego Zoo Director Charles Bieler established a new research department at the Zoo, the Center for Research on Endangered Species (CRES; later renamed the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species), with Benirschke as its director. Originally based in the Zoo's Biological Research Institute built 49 years prior, CRES eventually expanded to eight research- and education-centered divisions—Field Programs, Applied Animal Ecology, Applied Plant Ecology, <b>Behavioral</b> Biology, <b>Genetics,</b> Reproductive Physiology, Wildlife Disease Laboratories, and Conservation Education—employing over 150 scientists participating in over 160 conservation studies and projects in 35 countries.|$|R

2500|$|Shyness {{is often}} seen as a {{hindrance}} on people and their development. The cause of shyness is often disputed but {{it is found that}} fear is positively related to shyness, [...] suggesting that fearful children {{are much more likely to}} develop being shy as opposed to less fearful children. Shyness can also be seen on a biological level as a result of an excess of cortisol. When cortisol is present in greater quantities it is known to suppress an individual's immune system, making them more susceptible to illness and disease. The genetics of shyness is a relatively small area of research that has been receiving an even smaller amount of attention, although papers on the biological bases of shyness date back to 1988. Some research has indicated that shyness and aggression are related—through long and short forms of the gene DRD4, though considerably more research on this is needed. [...] Further, it has been suggested that shyness and social phobia (the distinction between the two is becoming ever more blurred) are related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. As with other studies of <b>behavioral</b> <b>genetics,</b> the study of shyness is complicated by the number of genes involved in, and the confusion in defining, the phenotype.

40|$|AbstractBased on the Huttenlocher lecture, {{this article}} {{describes}} the need for a more integrative scientific paradigm for addressing important questions raised by key observations made over 2 decades ago.
