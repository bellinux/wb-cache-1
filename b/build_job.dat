40|$|The {{increase}} in software system sizes and complexity {{has created a}} need for faster and more cost-efficient build systems to be researched. While the actual software building process is rather complex, most parts of it are usually automated by the build systems. Several modern build systems, such as HP's Domain Software Engineering Environment (DSEE) and openSUSE's Open Build Service (OBS), rely on distributing the computationally heavy build tasks to several build hosts equipped with the functionality to compile individual components and finally deliver the resulting software packages to the developers. The problem with such build systems is that while a single build system can scale well as a singular instance, hosting multiple build systems usually requires separate sets of hardware resources in order to complete the tasks. This thesis concentrates on a specific system, Open Build Service. OBS server dispatches the <b>build</b> <b>jobs</b> to separate <b>build</b> hosts that compile and package the source code provided by the developer. However, these build hosts cannot be shared between OBS instances which limits the scalability of the system. The research for this thesis led to a solution that is called the Flexible Worker Pool (FWP). The main concept of this solution was to provide separate OBS instances a service {{that allowed them to}} obtain additional build resources for the duration of their <b>build</b> <b>jobs</b> when required. This was achieved by designing and implementing a software system that functions as a dynamic proxy server between the OBS server and the dynamically allocated the build hosts. In order to allocate the resources fairly, a scheduler was also implemented within FWP. The goal was to create a virtual OBS network infrastructure that was controlled by FWP. The final implementation of the Flexible Worker Pool turned out to be superior to the static dedication of build resources. In cases where there were no parallel <b>build</b> <b>jobs</b> on multiple OBS instances, the computational capacity was equal to the whole pool of build resources being dedicated to each of the instances individually. Even in the cases with all OBS instances being loaded with near to constant need for build resources, the FWP solution functioned more efficiently. Due to the bursty nature of the need for build resources, the advantage of sharing the resources was often significant and the solution cost-effective as the same amount of hardware could now support more OBS instances...|$|R

Recent practice of CI server architecture has some new changes because of the emerging of Docker, the Operating System level virtualization. There are two main solutions of integrating Docker in Jenkins: using slave to spin out Docker container to build inside and directly using Docker container as slave to build inside. The former approach is called Docker Execution mode. The latter approach is called Docker Ephemeral Slave mode. This thesis work is a comparison study of the three modes of CI server: the Master/Slave mode, the Docker Execution mode, and the Docker Ephemeral Slave mode. Both quantitative and qualitative criteria for evaluating CI server, such as build waiting time and ease to configure, are proposed based on previous related studies and my working experience. Based on the criteria, the performance of three modes is compared to see the differences among the three modes. According to the advantages and disadvantages of each mode, the suggested applications of each mode are introduced. This study gets the following results. The Master/Slave mode has shorter build waiting time, easier configuration, and lower memory consumption of the slave for concurrent <b>build</b> <b>jobs</b> with poorer environment isolation, more complex maintenance, and higher memory consumption of the slave for single job running. The Docker Execution mode has better environment isolation, easier maintenance, and lower memory consumption of the slave (both single and concurrent) with longer build waiting time and more complex configuration.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to start a national conversation on tax reform and invites submissions from the public. Foreword Australia has experienced {{nearly a quarter of}} a century of uninterrupted economic growth. As a result, Australians continue to have some of the highest living standards in the world. Over the next few decades, the challenge for Australia is to maintain and improve standards of living through economic growth. The recent Intergenerational Report shows that continuing steps to boost productivity and encourage higher workforce participation will be critical to driving future economic growth. Tax reform is a key part of the Government’s policy agenda to <b>build</b> <b>jobs,</b> growth and opportunity. Last year, the Government abolished the carbon and mining taxes, which were a drag on growth. We also announced changes to the taxation arrangements for employee share schemes to provide generous incentives for new start-ups. This year, we will deliver a package for small business to expand opportunities for Australian businesses and workers. The Government is committed to ensuring that everyone is paying their fair share of tax. This year, we are continuing to work with the G 20 on the modernisation of international tax rules to address tax avoidance by multinational companies. But that is just the start. We want to have an open and constructive conversation with the community on how we can create a better tax system that delivers taxes that are lower, simpler, fairer. To deliver lasting, workable reforms, the community needs to be on board and engaged in the conversation. That’s why the Government is committing to a comprehensive and inclusive process. Releasing this tax discussion paper marks the start of what we hope will be a broad conversation about the current tax system and the issues confronting it. All are encouraged to take part. This conversation will support the development of a tax system to <b>build</b> <b>jobs,</b> growth and opportunity — a better tax system to deliver taxes that are lower, simpler, fairer.   Submissions can be lodged until 1 June 2015...|$|R

Employees’ capability, competence and skills would not make any improvement for the company if they are not willing to work hard to apply their capability, competence and skills and if the company gives the opportunity and appreciation for their capability, competence and skills, it would give them satisfaction and the workers will be motivated to work if they receive higher satisfaction from their job. Job satisfaction is very important since most problems occurring in organization, such as strike, demonstration, high level of absenteeism, are generally caused by job dissatisfaction. Therefore the job satisfaction of the employees in the organization should receive attention so as to preserve the healthy working condition and improve job motivation and productivity. This research was aimed at finding the characteristics that <b>build</b> <b>job</b> motivation and its relationship with the govermental employees’ job satisfaction at the Badung Regency.

40|$|Integrated {{models are}} the icons {{of a new}} welfare policy and {{practice}} in Australia, writes Paul Smyth • TONY ABBOTT’s call for “firm but fair” welfare reforms should make us all {{stop and think about}} the state of welfare in Australia today. There are indeed too many people excluded from the economic mainstream. The question is, why? Mr Abbott focuses on the supposed role of income support in undermining the incentive to work. His reform pathway relies on tougher compliance regimes.   We would support an emphasis on individuals doing their bit. But today unemployment is essentially a structural problem. Being unemployed is not primarily about the money, it’s about the lack of skills, relevant work experience and often robust health. A new social contract is needed which demands responsibility but also guarantees individuals’ effective access to the support and resources they need to make effective choices about their lives.    The “tough love” approach is too tied to the negative welfare thinking of the 1990 s, when unemployment welfare was seen as at odds with the free market economic agenda. Australia’s distinctive form of welfare protection through the wage system was largely dismantled, social services were deemed to be better off privatized, and commentators were inclined to proclaim the end of welfare as we know it. Social policy shrank to the dimensions of “welfare,” and “reform” became identified with getting people off income support. But surely this agenda belongs to the past. It didn’t work for the unemployed, and it doesn’t meet the needs of employers for job ready workers. Moreover, this old style thinking underestimates the importance of social investment not only for the economy but for ensuring that growth is inclusive. Around the world, the thinking behind the 1990 s paradigm is in decline. The new imperative is what the World Bank calls “inclusive growth. ” This is the new social policy approach that Australia sorely needs. Work for the Dole was the flagship program of the old agenda and the research shows that it actually reduced employment outcomes. The current employment assistance system works reasonable well for the majority of “job ready” unemployed. But it continues to fail highly disadvantaged job seekers, with participants churned through the system, placements in meaningless activities which don’t <b>build</b> <b>job</b> readiness or skills matched to labour needs and high drop-out rates from the labour force. Only a quarter of highly disadvantaged job seekers achieve a positive outcome comprising either full or part-time work or training. Convinced by the need for a new approach for the long-term unemployed, the Brotherhood of St Laurence has created a new program which it calls the Line of Sight (PDF). Working with our clients we saw that overwhelming they are not morally or behaviourally impaired individuals dodging their responsibilities. What they lack is an accessible service which shows them a clear pathway to a decent job via integrated support, work placement and training. What works is not the “big stick” approach but a commitment to connecting disadvantaged jobseekers with decent sustainable work. We see integrated models as the icons of a new welfare policy and practice in Australia. Through these we can offer excluded people a meaningful investment in a future they value. And this approach will better meet the growing recruitment needs of employers for entry level workers who have the foundational skills to sustain paid work. We are delighted that the Victorian government is making a major new investment in these programs. The British government is also showing the way forward through its new Work Programme, which will invest in disadvantaged job seekers to enable a pathway to sustainable employment. One approach that should be developed is the “off benefits” model, whereby the government uses future savings from reduced income support payments to provide paid real work opportunities directly with employers, who are then assisted  through the delivery of an integrated package of support and foundational training by contracted organisations.    More generally the emerging political debate points to the need for a social policy paradigm shift in Australia. What we need is a model which better integrates our social and economic goals. Economic growth alone is not enough. It must translate into individual flourishing and social inclusion. International policy agencies from the UN to the EU are adamant today that while growth can be inclusive it won’t be without an appropriate social policy regime. This is the inclusive growth agenda. •Professor Paul Smyth is a Professorial Fellow at the University of Melbourne and General Manager of the Research and Policy Centre at the Brotherhood of St Laurence Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E

While this has {{a direct impact on}} an IPs profits, some of {{the proposals}} aim to maximise revenue by increasing capacity to service workloads [19, 36, 44, 45]. In contrast, the authors in [23] aim to reduce the cost of using cloud infrastructure to customers on Amazon EC 2 [46], by automatically allocating resources based on the current demand. The authors in [24, 47] aim to reduce the complexity in resource provisioning of the Apache Hadoop framework [48], by enabling automated allocation of resources and configuration parameters, and minimise the incurred infrastructure cost. Both approaches attempt to predict the workload behaviour to optimise run time performance, however they differ in their methodology. The authors in [24] used offline training, while the authors in [47] used historical data from past jobs. The latter approach may initially produce lower optimal allocations as it <b>builds</b> <b>job</b> performance history. However, over time this could enable the approach to build better clusters of workload signatures that enable it to make more optimal allocations. Therefore there is a tradeoff between initial performance and time taken to build workload knowledge. While offline approaches can be used to improve the online decision making process by constructing a model of the system behaviour, this has an upfront overhead and is not practical to apply for every application deployed on IaaS.|$|R
