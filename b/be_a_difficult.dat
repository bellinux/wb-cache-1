5|$|During {{practice}} {{before the}} game, California kicker Tyler Fredrickson practiced kicking the ball high to avoid {{what was expected}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> Virginia Tech kick-blocking attack. During the regular season, Fredrickson had five kicks blocked and successfully converted just 14 of 29field goal attempts. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, blocked 102kicks in the 200games previous to the Insight Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup continues to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union {{would go on to}} describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E

5|$|Madsen's {{first year}} as {{chairman}} of the club proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> year for Malmö FF as they were relegated from Allsvenskan for the first time, leaving the top flight {{for the first time since}} the club's demotion in 1934, ending a run of 63 consecutive seasons in the first division. Madsen and the club's director of sports, Hasse Borg, initiated a programme for Malmö FF to regain its place in the top league, and the club was promoted back to Allsvenskan in 2000, after one season in Superettan. Nineteen-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimović emerged as the club's leading goalscorer, scoring 12 goals in 26 games. Ibrahimović was sold to Ajax in 2001 for 86.2million SEK (approximately €10.2million); as of 2012, this is the highest transfer fee paid to a Swedish football club.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1941, Hitler issued Directive No. 27, {{including}} his occupation policy for Greece. He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with Directive No. 31 issued on 9 June. Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria, with Italy occupying {{the bulk of}} the country (see map opposite). German forces occupied the strategically more important areas of Athens, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia and several Aegean islands, including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria. Bulgaria, which had not participated in the invasion of Greece, occupied most of Thrace {{on the same day that}} Tsolakoglou offered his surrender. The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Evros River. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on 28 April. On 2 June, they occupied the Peloponnese; on 8 June, Thessaly; and on 12 June, most of Attica. The occupation of Greece—during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, many dying from privation and hunger—proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> and costly task. Several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.|$|E
5|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{production}} when the 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained {{a copy of}} the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, {{and by the end of}} the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.|$|E

25|$|Reconstructing {{the life}} and {{doctrine}} of Arius has proven to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task, as none of his original writings survive. Emperor Constantine ordered their burning while Arius was still living, and any that survived this purge were later destroyed by his Orthodox opponents.
