40|$|A {{fast and}} {{accurate}} enzymatic {{estimation of the}} concentration of aminoglycoside antiobiotics in serum is given by aminoglycoside 4 ′-adenylyltransferase (synonym: tobramycin adenylyltransferase), a new enzyme recently found in tobramycin-resistant staphylococci (P. Santanam and F. H. Kayser, J. Infect. Dis. [Suppl. ], in press). This enzyme is useful in assaying the kanamycins, the <b>butirosins,</b> amikacin, ribostamycin and, if required, the neomycins, tobramycin, and paromomycin. In combination with the assay using aminoglycoside 2 ′′-adenylyltransferase (synonym: gentamicin adenylyltransferase) to determine the level of gentamicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin, a convenient method to estimate {{a wide range of}} aminoglycoside antibiotics in patients' sera is described...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{strains of}} Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} {{resistant to the}} aminoglycoside antibiotics were shown to contain an enzyme that inactivates the kanamycins, neomycins, <b>butirosins,</b> paromomycin, gentamicin A, amikacin, and tobramycin by adenylylation.

With paromomycin or neomycin Band C as substrates, however, two pH values (5. 5 and 9. 0) for optimal activity were observed. The enzyme requires Mg+ + for activity and is stabilized significantly by dithiothreitol. It is probable that the 4 ′-hydroxyl group of ring I of the antibiotics is adenylylated.

50|$|The {{kanamycin}} biosynthetic pathway can {{be divided}} into two parts. The first part is common to several aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as <b>butirosin</b> and neomycin. In it a unique aminocyclitol, 2-deoxystreptamine, is biosynthesized from D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate in four steps. At this point the kanamycin pathway splits into two branches due to the promiscuity of the next enzyme, which can utilize two different glycosyl donors - UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine and UDP-α-D-glucose. One of the branches forms kanamycin C and kanamycin B, while the other branch forms kanamycin D and kanamycin X. However, both kanamycin B and kanamycin D can be converted to kanamycin A, so both branches of the pathway converge at kanamycin A.|$|E

40|$|<b>Butirosin</b> {{is a new}} aminoglycosidic {{antibiotic}} complex {{which has}} broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, {{as well as some}} bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. <b>Butirosin</b> is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses...|$|E
40|$|<b>Butirosin</b> {{is unique}} among the {{naturally}} occurring aminoglycosides, having a substituted amino group at position 1 (N 1) of the 2 -deoxystreptamine ring with an (S) - 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxybutyrate (AHB) group. While bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides can be ascribed chiefly to drug inactivation by plasmid-encoded aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, {{the presence of}} an AHB group protects the aminoglycoside from binding to many resistance enzymes, and hence, the antibiotic retains its bactericidal properties. Consequently, several semisynthetic N 1 -substituted aminoglycosides, such as amikacin, isepamicin, and netilmicin, were developed. Unfortunately, <b>butirosin,</b> amikacin, and isepamicin are not resistant to inactivation by 3 ′-aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferase type IIIa [APH(3 ′) -IIIa]. We report here the crystal structure of APH(3 ′) -IIIa in complex with an ATP analog, AMPPNP [adenosine 5 ′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate], and <b>butirosin</b> A to 2. 4 -Å resolution. The structure shows that <b>butirosin</b> A binds to the enzyme in a manner analogous to other 4, 5 -disubstituted aminoglycosides, and the flexible antibiotic-binding loop is key to the accommodation of structurally diverse substrates. Based on the crystal structure, we have also constructed a model of APH(3 ′) -IIIa in complex with amikacin, a commonly used semisynthetic N 1 -substituted 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycoside. Together, these results suggest a strategy to further derivatize the AHB group in order to generate new aminoglycoside derivatives that can elude inactivation by resistance enzymes while maintaining their ability to bind to the ribosomal A site...|$|E

40|$|The {{isolation}} of Providencia stuartii resistant to multiple aminoglycoside antibiotics prompted {{an investigation into}} the mechanism of their resistance. Crude enzyme extracts of a strain of P. stuartii inactivated kanamycin, lividomycin A, and <b>butirosin</b> B in the presence of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), as measured by a microbiological assay. The occurrence of inhibitory concentrations of 500 μg or greater per ml against kanamycin, lividomycin A, and <b>butirosin</b> B, coupled with the inactivation of these antibiotics in the presence of ATP, suggested enzymatic phosphorylation. This was documented by the transfer of the γ-phosphate of [γ- 32 P]ATP. In contrast, the inability to inactivate gentamicin or tobramycin by the crude enzyme extracts in the presence of ATP suggests another enzymatic mechanism of resistance for these antibiotics, such as adenylation or acetylation. Of importance is the fact that amikacin, a semisynthetic analogue of kanamycin A which is resistant to inactivation by most resistance transfer factor enzymes, was found to inhibit the growth of P. stuartii at low concentrations...|$|E

Oligosporogenous mutants failed to synthesize the antibiotic and to degrade poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate.

40|$|The broad-spectrum {{aminoglycoside}} phosphotransferase, APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa, confers {{resistance to}} several aminoglycoside antibiotics in opportunistic pathogens {{of the genera}} Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. The profile of the drug resistance phenotype suggested that the enzyme would transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the 32 ̆ 7 -hydroxyl of aminoglycosides. In addition, resistance to the 32 ̆ 7 -deoxyaminoglycoside antibiotic, lividomycin A, suggested possible transfer to the 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyl of the ribose [Trieu-Cuot, P., and Courvalin, P. (1983) Gene 23, 331 - 341]. Using purified overexpressed enzyme, we have prepared and purified the products of APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa-dependent phosphorylation of several of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Mass spectral analysis revealed that 4, 6 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics such as amikacin and kanamycin are monophosphorylated, while 4, 5 -disubstituted aminoglycosides such as <b>butirosin</b> A, ribostamycin, and neomycin B are both mono- and diphosphorylated by APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa. Using a series of one- and two-dimensional 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P NMR experiments, we have unambiguously assigned the regiospecificity of phosphoryl transfer to several antibiotics. The 4, 6 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics are exclusively phosphorylated at the 32 ̆ 7 -OH hydroxyl, and the 4, 5 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics can be phosphorylated at both the 32 ̆ 7 - and 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyls. The first phosphorylation can occur on either the 32 ̆ 7 - or 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyl group of neomycin B or <b>butirosin</b> A. Initial phosphotransfer to the 32 ̆ 7 -position predominates for <b>butirosin</b> while the 52 ̆ 2 -OH is favored for neomycin. These results open {{the potential for the}} rational design of aminoglycoside kinase inhibitors based on functionalization of either the 6 -aminohexose or the pentose rings of aminoglycoside antibiotics...|$|E

This plasmid, pMG 5, {{belongs to the}} same incompatibility group as plasmids determining gentamicin resistance in P. aeruginosa via gentamicin acetyltransferase I. Like other members of this group, it also confers resistance to Hg 2 +, organomercurials, and certain deoxyribonucleic acid phages. When pMG 5 is introduced into a cell carrying a related R factor, some transconjugants can subsequently cotransfer new combinations of resistance determinants as though recombinant plasmids had been formed...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus circulans NRRL B- 3312, a nonpathogenic {{bacterium}} {{that produces}} the aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>butirosin,</b> is known to contain an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase {{that is similar to}} the neomycin phosphotransferases of clinically isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Purified DNAs from B. circulans and the plasmid ColE 1 -ApR were digested with EcoRI endonuclease and the resulting fragments covalently joined with polynucleotide ligase. The recombined DNA was used to transform E. coli and ampicillin-neomycin resistant colonies were selected. Analysis of several clones indicated that neomycin resistance in the E. coli transformants was due to the presence of the B. circulans phosphotransferase gene. This observation is consistent with the notion that anitbiotic-modifying enzymes from antibiotic-producing organisms may be the sources of antibiotic resistance in plasmid-containing bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 40 % of Escherichia coli strains {{isolated}} from clinical specimens at the Institute of Medical Microbiology of the University of Zurich were resistant to kanamycin but susceptible to tobramycin in disk diffusion tests.

The disk diffusion test, therefore, failed to detect resistance to tobramycin in kanamycin-resistant E. coli strains.

40|$|SummaryButirosin, an {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic {{produced by}} Bacillus circulans, bears the unique (S) - 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side chain, which protects the antibiotic from several common resistance mechanisms. The AHBA side chain is advantageously incorporated into clinically valuable antibiotics such as amikacin and arbekacin by synthetic methods. Therefore, {{it is of}} significant interest to explore the biosynthetic origins of this useful moiety. We report here that the AHBA side chain of <b>butirosin</b> is transferred from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) BtrI to the parent aminoglycoside ribostamycin as a γ-glutamylated dipeptide by the ACP:aminoglycoside acyltransferase BtrH. The protective γ-glutamyl group is then cleaved by BtrG via an uncommon γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase mechanism. The application of this pathway to the in vitro enzymatic production of novel AHBA-bearing aminoglycosides is explored with encouraging implications for the preparation of unnatural antibiotics via directed biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryButirosins A and B are {{naturally}} occurring aminoglycoside antibiotics {{that have a}} (2 S) - 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side chain. Semisynthetic addition of AHBA to clinically valuable aminoglycoside antibiotics has been shown both to improve their pharmacological properties and to prevent their deactivation {{by a number of}} aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes involved in bacterial resistance. We report here that the biosynthesis of AHBA from L-glutamate, encoded within a previously identified <b>butirosin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster, proceeds via intermediates tethered to a specific acyl carrier protein (ACP). Five components of the pathway have been purified and characterized, including the ACP (BtrI), an ATP-dependent ligase (BtrJ), a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylase (BtrK), and a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase system (BtrO and the previously unreported BtrV). The proposed biosynthetic pathway includes a γ-glutamylation of an ACP-derived γ-aminobutyrate intermediate, possibly a rare example of protective group chemistry in biosynthesis...|$|E

LCI, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from Bacillus subtilis, shows very strong antagonistic activity against the Gram-negative pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv Oryzea of rice leaf-blight disease and Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas solanacearum PE 1 (Gong et al. 2011). YFGAP, a GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide {{isolated from the}} skin of yellowfin tuna, have antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptococcus iniae. And hGAPDH is a human GAPDH fragment peptide from human placental tissue exhibiting antifungal activity. The existence of LCI, YFGAP, hGAPDH-like AMPs in strain GFP- 2 may partially explain its inhibitory effects on Gram negative/positive bacterium. Additionally, YFGAP, hGAPDH-like AMPs are also first predicted in strains of genus Bacillus.|$|E

One extension, termed a SPASM domain, binds two auxiliary [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters and is present within peptide-modifying enzymes. The first structure of a SPASM-containing enzyme, anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzyme (anSME), revealed unexpected similarities to two non-SPASM proteins, <b>butirosin</b> biosynthetic enzyme 2 -deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase (BtrN) and molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic enzyme (MoaA). The latter two enzymes bind one auxiliary cluster and exhibit a partial SPASM motif, coined a Twitch domain.

AD-BTN retained the good activity of the parent compound against other gram-negative pathogens. Whereas GTM minimal inhibitory concentrations were elevated 35 -fold against GTM-resistant P. aeruginosa in vitro, the minimal inhibitory concentration of AD-BTN was only doubled.

40|$|The {{aminoglycoside}} phosphotransferases (APHs) {{are widely}} distributed among pathogenic bacteria and are employed to covalently modify, and thereby detoxify, the clinically relevant aminoglycoside antibiotics. The crystal structure {{for one of}} these aminoglycoside kinases, APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa, has been determined in complex with ADP and analysis of the electrostatic surface potential indicates that there is a large anionic depression present adjacent to the terminal phosphate group of the nucleotide. This region also includes a conserved COOH-terminal alpha-helix that contains the COOH-terminal residue Phe(264). We report here mutagenesis and computer modeling studies aimed at examining the mode of aminoglycoside binding to APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa. Specifically, seven site mutants were studied, five from the COOH-terminal helix (Asp(261), Glu(262), and Phe(264)), and two additional residues that line the wall of the anionic depression (Tyr(55) and Arg(211)). Using a molecular modeling approach, six ternary complexes of APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa.
