5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{airlines}} {{were considering}} upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as an alternative to <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United Airlines to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and SNECMA were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial realms.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company chose this option instead of <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The W.F. Stanley and Co. company {{continued}} to expand after Stanley's death, {{moving to a}} factory in New Eltham (The Stanley Scientific Instrument Works) in 1916. During World War I, the factory was requisitioned by the government. Between the wars, it {{continued to}} expand {{its position in the}} market place for quality surveying instruments, although it was requisitioned by the British Government during World War II. After the war, the company continued to expand, participating in many large project– for example, RMS Queen Mary and Royal Navy ships used the company's compasses and other navigational instruments. The company went into liquidation in July 1999– the main factors were not investing the proceeds of the sale of the factory land to <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> machinery, the high value of the pound affecting export orders, and the loss of Ministry of Defence orders following the end of the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the RNZAF {{considered}} options to replace or upgrade its A-4Ks. A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France, the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft, and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals {{to upgrade the}} Skyhawks. After {{the decision was made}} to disband the RAN's fighter force, the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A-4Gs and spare parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $NZ40 million. The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of this deal on 5 September 1983. A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A-4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition. The commander of the RNZAF, Air Vice-Marshal David Crooks, favoured purchasing the A-4Gs and then upgrading the entire A-4 fleet over the alternative of <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> aircraft, as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force's capabilities. He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal be taken up, and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984. As part of the purchase agreement, the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service.|$|E
5|$|The AESC {{continued}} to snub the government. Playford advocated {{the use of}} brown coal from the South Australian Leigh Creek mine to avoid supply complications, and even made into law a bill encouraging its use. He also championed {{the development of the}} town and the expansion of the mine, which had been dormant for several decades, to ease the state's dependency on imported coal. Much state and federal government money was invested in the scheme, the town infrastructure was built, and the production started in February 1944. Shortly afterwards, the AESC responded by <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> boilers which would only be able to the more productive black coal. With more conflicts ensuing, and even with the company slowly relenting, Playford did not stop his struggle. A Royal Commission in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties, and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be nationalised. A few months later, Playford's stance received a boost when heavy strikes in New South Wales forced shutdowns in South Australia that saw thousands of labourers out of work. By then {{at the head of the}} only conservative government in the nation, when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee and enthusiasm. On 11 October, he presented a bill to Parliament to nationalise the AESC and create the Electricity Trust of South Australia.|$|E

25|$|For the refurbishment, {{trainsets}} weretaken out {{of service}} for five weeks (25 work days). Refurbishing a single ICE1 trainsets costs about three million Euro, {{a fraction of the}} cost of <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> trains. The entire program cost about 180 million Euro.|$|E

About 35,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions were avoided as well as about 500,000 tons of industrial waste.|$|E
25|$|In the Lazair {{application}} the 185 {{was used}} to drive two propellers stacked together in biplane configuration. This was not done for aerodynamic reasons but rather because the Lazair manufacturer had ample quantities of the nylon propellers on hand for its earlier engines and stacking them was more cost efficient than scrapping them and <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> propellers.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{method of}} waste management is {{the prevention of}} waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of <b>buying</b> <b>new,</b> designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material {{to achieve the same}} purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).|$|E

The railroad continued <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> and used Baldwins {{for the next several}} decades. In 1985, the first EMD diesel, a GP-38 was purchased, followed shortly by additional GP-38s and SD9s. In 2003, the railroad bought two SD-40-2s, and, unusually, an FP7 two years later.|$|E
25|$|Although Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia {{as one of}} {{the poorest}} republics, {{socio-economic}} interventions undertaken by the consecutive democratically elected governments managed to improve the economic picture in the country. According to the International Crisis Group, there was nearly 3% growth in 1999. The second half of 2000 also saw steady growth, leading to a 5% GDP increase for the year. In January 2001, the government projected a budget surplus {{for the second year in}} a row.

25|$|The R {{purchased}} the Pitkin Building on Main Street West and Oak Street in Rochester {{and added a}} two-story Gothic structure to it. The board then hired a highly qualified manager in George E Merchant, who had excelled as a division superintendent for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St Paul, and Pacific. Among the issues he faced upon beginning work in the head office in Rochester were several pending lawsuits against the R and disputes arising from the shady land acquisition practices of the company's forebear. Resolving these, he proceeded to improve the capital plant, including refurbishing the older locomotives and <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> ones. He bought more 4-4-0 Brooks engines, {{as well as a}} number of 2-8-0 Consolidations. Line construction absorbed considerable resources as well.|$|E
25|$|In August 1995, the Secretary of the Navy {{authorized}} the Marine Corps to upgrade its utility and attack helicopters {{as a bridge}} until the Joint Replacement Aircraft was available in 2020. In 1996, the Marine Corps launched the H-1 upgrade program by signing a contract with Bell for upgrading 180 AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs and upgrading 100 UH-1Ns into UH-1Ys. While the original contract called for upgrading existing airframes, it was later modified in 2008 to manufacture completely new aircraft. The program also includes aircraft simulators. Richard Aboulafia, {{an analyst at the}} Teal Group, suggests that the motivation to upgrade the H-1s instead of <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters was to avoid risk to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey program.|$|E
25|$|From 2015 all buses in Scotland {{will have}} to be {{disabled}} accessible to meet the Disability Discrimination Act. This act has caused a great deal of resentment in the bus industry as it will require a large amount of money to be spent modifying or <b>buying</b> <b>new</b> buses that comply with the act, for what is perceived to be little benefit. It also sees a number of otherwise serviceable buses taken off the road and made worthless before the end of their natural life. In Scotland {{there are a number of}} situations where currently no suitable buses are manufactured that could operate due the hilly and uneven road conditions which damage disabled accessible vehicles. The Isle of Arran is one example, where extensive road improvements will be required before disabled accessible buses can be operated extensively on the island.|$|E
