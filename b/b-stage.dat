The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used {{the smallest of the}} sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a <b>B-stage,</b> a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the <b>B-stage</b> doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|The Dream Within a Dream Tour was {{the fourth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her third studio album, Britney (2001). The tour was promoted by Concerts West, marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment. On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a <b>B-stage,</b> united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the <b>B-stage.</b> The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.|$|E
5|$|Eight hundred dancers auditioned to be {{included}} in Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and a selected group of them, consisting only of females, were chosen for the performance {{as well as for the}} tour. French dancing duo Les Twins also accompanied Beyoncé on stage performing street dances. Three backing singers The Mamas, and an eleven-piece female band who had also supported the singer during her previous tours performed during the concerts. Two stages were used during the performances: a main stage where the singer performed throughout most of the concert and a <b>B-stage</b> closer to the audience where she was transferred with a rope, flying over the crowd midway through the set, performing three songs there. The set list of the 2013 portion of the tour included approximately twenty five songs from Beyoncé's four solo studio albums: Dangerously in Love (2003), B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). The majority of the songs originated from 4 – seven songs were performed from that album. Many of the tracks performed contained different choreographies and arrangements compared to the previous performances by the singer; several of them were intertwined with other artists' material. For the 2014 shows many of the previously performed songs were removed and eight new songs from Beyoncé's fifth self-titled studio album were added to the concert's set list.|$|E

The <b>B-staged</b> laminates were subjected to storage for various periods of time {{up to six months}} at ambient shop conditions and high humidity prior to fabrication into {{structural elements}} to determine the processability of the graphite/polyimide after exposure to these conditions. Changes in processability were monitored by measuring flexure and interlaminar shear strengths, glass transition temperature, moisture content, and formability of the <b>B-staged</b> laminates. No significant change in the processability of either Celion 6000 /PMR or Celion 6000 /LaRC- 160 was recorded indicating that after <b>B-staging</b> the graphite/polyimide laminates can be stored for extended periods of time in normal shop and high humidity environments and then be fabricated into defect-free structural elements in heated platen presses...|$|R

40|$|The {{processability}} of a phenylethynyl terminated imide (PETI) resin {{matrix composite}} was investigated. Unidirectional prepregs {{were made by}} coating an N-methylpyrrolidone solution of the amide acid oligomer onto unsized IM 7. Two batches of prepregs were used: one was made by NASA in-house, {{and the other was}} from an industrial source. The composite processing robustness was investigated with respect to the effect of <b>B-staging</b> conditions, the prepreg shelf life, and the optimal processing window. Rheological measurements indicated that PETI's processability was only slightly affected over a wide range of <b>B-staging</b> temperatures (from 250 C to 300 C). The open hole compression (OHC) strength values were statistically indistinguishable among specimens consolidated using various <b>B-staging</b> conditions. Prepreg rheology and OHC strengths were also found not to be affected by prolonged (i. e., up to 60 days) ambient storage. An optimal processing window was established using response surface methodology. It was found that IM 7 /PETI composite is more sensitive to the consolidation temperature than to the consolidation pressure. A good consolidation was achievable at 371 C/ 100 Psi, which yielded an OHC strength of 62 Ksi at room temperature. However, processability declined dramatically at temperatures below 350 C...|$|R

25|$|In {{support of}} the album, U2 {{launched}} the Vertigo Tour, which featured five legs {{and a total of}} 131 shows. The first and third legs featured indoor concerts in North America, while the second and fourth legs featured outdoor concerts in Europe and Central/South America, respectively. The final leg, which saw the band touring the Pacific, was delayed due to an illness suffered by The Edge's daughter Sian. The stage design of the indoor Vertigo Tour shows was a stripped-down, intimate affair for the fans and featured an ellipse-shaped <b>B-stage</b> extending from the main stage. In total, the Vertigo Tour had sold 4,619,021 tickets for a total gross of $389million; the gross was the second-highest such figure ever. Three concert films depicting the tour, , , and U2 3D, were recorded.|$|E
25|$|The {{set list}} for the concerts {{included}} songs from Knowles' three studio albums {{as well as several}} covers of other artists and a Destiny's Child medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; her emotional side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album I Am... Sasha Fierce. The show featured two stages – the main one and a smaller <b>B-stage</b> where Knowles was transferred {{during the middle of the}} show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big LED screen. Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the choreography, lighting and production. Chris March made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>B-staging</b> is {{a process}} that {{utilizes}} heat or UV light to remove the majority of solvent from an adhesive, thereby allowing construction to be “staged.” In between adhesive application, assembly and curing, the product can be held for a period of time, without sacrificing performance.|$|R
50|$|Attempts to use {{traditional}} epoxies in IC packaging often created expensive production bottlenecks, because, {{as soon as}} the {{epoxy adhesive}} was applied, the components had to be assembled and cured immediately. <b>B-staging</b> eliminates these bottlenecks by allowing the IC manufacturing to proceed efficiently, with each step performed on larger batches of product.|$|R
40|$|This work {{is mainly}} focused upon the preparation, {{processing}} {{and evaluation of}} mechanical and material properties of epoxy/single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) nanocomposite thin films. <b>B-staged</b> epoxy/SWCNT nanocomposite thin films at 50 % of cure have been prepared for improving conductivity and mechanical performance of laminated composites. The SWCNTs were functionalized by oxidation and subsequent grafting using polyamidoamine generation 0 dendrimers (PAMAM-G 0). The epoxy nanocomposites containing SWCNTs were successfully cast into thin films by manipulating degree of cure and viscosity of epoxy. The first section of this study focuses on the covalent oxidation and functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which is {{necessary in order to}} obtain the full benefit of the SWCNTs inherent properties for reinforcement. In the second section of this work the preparation of <b>B-staged</b> epoxy/SWCNT nanocomposite thin films is discussed and what the purposes of thin films are. Additionally, the morphology as well as mechanical properties is evaluated by numerous means to obtain a clear picture as to the mechanisms of the epoxy/SWCNT nanocomposites. Furthermore, the effects of using sulfanilamide as a more attractive surface modifier for improved dispersion and adhesion and the effects of nylon particles for improved toughening on epoxy/SWCNT nanocomposites are discussed which displays improvements in numerous areas. Finally, based on these findings and previous studies, the <b>B-staged</b> epoxy/SWCNT nanocomposite thin films can be seamlessly integrated into laminated composite systems upon heating, and can serve as interleaves for improving conductivity and mechanical strengths of laminated fiber composite systems...|$|R

500|$|Zoo TV {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{large-scale}} concerts to feature a <b>B-stage,</b> where performances were intended [...] "to be the antidote to Zoo TV". The idea had been inspired by the successful informality of the Elvis Presley 68 Comeback Special. Here, the band played quieter songs, such as acoustic arrangements of [...] "Angel of Harlem", [...] "When Love Comes to Town", [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)", and Lou Reed's [...] "Satellite of Love". Many critics compared the <b>B-stage</b> performances to [...] "busking" [...] and singled them out as the shows' highlights.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} <b>B-stage,</b> U2 often played [...] "Bad" [...] or [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", with {{performances}} of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] following. For [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and swastikas. During [...] "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed {{the actions of}} a heroin addict from the <b>B-stage,</b> rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the <b>B-stage,</b> before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight. [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from The Joshua Trees photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] while a clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famed [...] "I've Been to the Mountaintop" [...] speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that the leap {{from the rest of the}} show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought that it was important to demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated performances of [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] in acoustic form on the <b>B-stage</b> with using it to close the main set.|$|E

500|$|The stage also {{consists}} of a runway, which also acts as a treadmill leading onto a <b>B-stage</b> that fills with a pool of water. The treadmill on the catwalk {{was designed to be}} waterproof in order to withstand unpredictable weather found in outdoor stadiums. The <b>B-stage</b> stores 2,000 gallons of water inside of it and takes approximately 10 minutes to fill up, which occurs without the audience even realising. The inspiration for the water within the <b>B-stage</b> was inspired by the tour's supporting album Lemonade, in particularly the song [...] "Forward", as the songs message is described as a turning point from anger to forgiveness. [...] "The pool of water is the antithesis to the fire-spitting monolith; the most joyful, redemptive sequence of the show takes place here, from [...] "Freedom" [...] through to [...] "Halo"", stated Devlin. The tour's stage and production was said to be so large that the maximum capacity of some venues was reduced in order to make space for it. A writer for the Belfast Telegraph stated that the maximum capacity for Beyoncé's concert in Dublin at Croke Park was reduced from 82,500 to 75,000 people to allow for the size of the stage, with event organiser Eamon Fox stating [...] "It's a jaw-dropping production and stage show and one of the biggest that's ever been in Croke Park".|$|E

50|$|Decorative {{laminates}} {{were made}} by impregnating large sheets of kraft paper with phenolic resin, which was then partially cured (<b>B-staged</b> by passing through a long drying oven) and cut to sheet lengths at the oven exit. The dry treated sheets were stiff and somewhat brittle. A decorative sheet (solid colored, or wood-grained, or patterned), impregnated with melamine resin and <b>B-staged</b> and cut to length {{in a similar manner}} to the phenolic core sheets, was laid on a polished stainless steel press plate. Then several plies or layers of kraft paper impregnated with a phenolic resin were placed on top of the decorative layer. The number of plies of kraft used yielded products of varying thickness depending upon end-use requirements. Next, a sheet of release paper that would not bond to the phenolic resin was placed on top of the phenolic kraft and following this a mirror image build-up of the assembly already on the press plate. Finally, another polished stainless steel press plate was placed on top of the pack assembly. On {{the other side of this}} plate another similar assembly was built until there were several laminates in one press pack to go into a single opening in the hydraulic press. The huge hydraulic presses, perhaps 5 feet by 12 feet, had many heated openings thus many laminates could be produced in a single press cycle of about one hour duration. Great pressure (in excess of 1000 psi and heat to 150 degrees Celsius) were applied to each press pack. The <b>B-staged</b> melamine and phenolic resins first flowed to bond the interlaminar plies together, then the plastic resins thermoset to provide a very durable product that could tolerate much heat and abrasion.|$|R
500|$|U2's {{subsequent}} concert tour, 1997's PopMart Tour, {{followed in}} Zoo TV's footsteps by mocking another social trend, this time consumerism. Paul McGuinness {{said the group}} wanted [...] "the production [...] to beat Zoo TV", and accordingly, the tour's spectacle was a further shift away from their austere stage shows of the 1980s; PopMart's stage featured a [...] LED screen, a [...] golden arch containing the sound system, and a mirrorball lemon {{that served as a}} transport to the <b>B-stage.</b> Although critics were much less receptive to PopMart, in a 2009 interview, Bono said that he considers that tour to be their best: [...] "Pop(Mart) is our finest hour.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method is}} {{described}} for analyzing {{the effect of}} nonuniformities in temper-ature on the flow of resin during the lamination of <b>B-staged</b> prepreg layers. The nonunifor-mities in temperature affect {{the distribution of the}} resin viscosity and flow in a complex manner due to the presence of a cross linking reaction which renders the viscosity of the resin dependent on its thermal history. The viscosity distribution and the flow field are determined by evaluating the trajectories or, equivalently, the thermal histories of the fluid elements for a few representative temperature distributions. It is shown that, depending upon the nature of nonuniformity, the magnitude of the resin flow can differ significantly from that evaluated by assuming a uniform temperature distribution in the lamination assembly...|$|R
500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a <b>B-stage,</b> and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the <b>B-stage</b> was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Bono's recuperation, U2 {{embarked}} on the Innocence + Experience Tour in May 2015, visiting arenas in North America and Europe from May through December. The group structured their concerts around a loose autobiographical narrative of [...] "innocence" [...] passing into [...] "experience", with a fixed set of songs {{for the first}} half of each show and a varying second half, separated by an intermission—a first for U2 concerts. The stage spanned the length of the venue floor and comprised three sections: a rectangular main stage, a smaller circular <b>B-stage,</b> and a connecting walkway. The centerpiece of the set was a [...] double-sided video screen that featured an interior catwalk, allowing the band members to perform amidst the video projections. U2's sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array, in hopes of improving acoustics by evenly distributing sound throughout the arena. In total, the tour grossed US$152.2million from 1.29million tickets sold. The final date of the tour, one of two Paris shows rescheduled due to the 13 November 2015 attacks in the city, was filmed for the video [...] and broadcast on the American television network HBO.|$|E
500|$|During the Zoo TV Tour, the song's {{performance}} was significantly altered.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} February 2006, {{under the supervision}} of the 3D cinematographer Peter Anderson; two shows were filmed in Mexico City to capture medium shots during a practice run for the crew to learn the choreography of U2's performances. The crew captured additional medium shots using two camera setups at the two São Paulo concerts, and captured overhead footage of drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. using a single camera setup at the show in Santiago. During preparations for the Buenos Aires concerts, U2 performed a 10-song set without an audience, so that the crew could capture close-up footage using a wide-angle lens; doing so in-concert would have interfered with the show. Owens dubbed the session the [...] "phantom shoot". During the Buenos Aires shows, all nine camera setups were used, capturing shots of U2 from the <b>B-stages.</b> The Buenos Aires shoot was the largest of the project, requiring a crew of 140people.|$|R
500|$|The concerts were {{filmed in}} a style which Owens {{described}} as [...] "very unorthodox"; no storyboards or shooting scripts were used to ensure footage of U2's performances was improvised. Instead of being directed, U2 performed each of their concerts as usual, with the filming crew capturing footage in real time for the full -hour concerts. The shoots were planned such that the band's performance and the audience's view was uninterrupted. To avoid capturing other camera rigs in the footage, the crew would either film {{from the back of}} the stage, or alternate each night between shooting left-to-right and right-to-left. Several shows were edited together to create one performance; therefore, U2 were required to wear the same clothes every night to maintain continuity. Additional spotlights were focused on the audience during filming, and the lighting was dimmed on the stage's LED display. 110 microphones were used to record the concert audio, which included microphones placed on the main stage and around the two <b>B-stages</b> to record the band, and microphones placed throughout the venue to record the audience.|$|R
