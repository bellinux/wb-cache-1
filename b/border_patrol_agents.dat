25|$|To help combat illegal {{immigration}} {{across the border}} with Mexico, Romney {{has said that the}} U.S. must erect a fence along the entire 2,600 mile border, equipped with technology to detect attempts to breach the barrier, and outfitted with adequate numbers of <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> {{demanded to}} know where he was from. He {{answered}} their question accurately and produced a copy of a form showing his admission into the U.S. as a refugee. The agents asked whether he had been fingerprinted and photographed through NSEERS ("Special Registration"). He answered, accurately, that he had not: refugees are exempt from that program. They arrested him.|$|E

5000|$|Testifying {{in front}} of the United States Senate, <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> Chief Mark Morgan said that the <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> is the one of the most {{assaulted}} law enforcement agencies; since 2006, over seven thousand <b>agents</b> of the <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> were attacked. [...] On numerous occasions USBP agents have been fired upon from the Mexican side of the international border. Intelligence gathering has discovered bounties being placed on <b>Patrol</b> <b>Agents</b> to be paid by criminal smuggling organizations upon the confirmed murder or kidnapping of a U.S. <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Agent.</b> In 2008, intelligence learned of a two-million-dollar contract for the murder of a <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Agent.</b> In 2009 <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Agent</b> Rosas was murdered in an ambush while on patrol; a bounty may have been paid to the assassins.|$|R
25|$|The Santa Fe riot was a {{confrontation}} at a Japanese internment camp near Santa Fe, New Mexico, during World War II. On March 12, 1945, approximately 275 internees assembled in Camp Santa Fe {{to watch and}} protest the removal of three men to another camp. During which, a scuffle broke out between the internees and the <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> who were guarding the facility, resulting {{in the use of}} tear gas grenades, batons, and the serious injury of four internees.|$|E
25|$|Following the November 2006 election, Giffords {{was sworn}} in as a congresswoman on January 3, 2007. She was the third woman in Arizona's history to be elected to serve in the U.S.Congress. In her inaugural speech {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives, Giffords {{advocated}} a comprehensive immigration reform package, including modern technology to secure the border, more <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>agents,</b> tough employer sanctions for businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants, and a guest-worker program. In her first month in office, Giffords voted in favor of increased federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research; raising the minimum wage; endorsing the 9/11 Commission recommendations; new rules for the House of Representatives targeting ethical issues; and the repeal of $14billion of subsidies to big oil companies, in favor of renewable energy subsidies and the founding of the Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump {{signed an}} {{executive}} order temporarily suspending entry to the US from Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, and Libya, and a suspension of entry from Syria for an indefinite period. The order also limited the number of refugees permitted to enter the United States in 2017 to 50,000 and suspended the United States Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days to allow authorities to review the application and adjudication processes. The order was replaced with a new executive order in March 2017 with various changes including removing Iraq {{from the list of}} countries with suspended immigration, clarifying that legal immigrants are exempt from the ban, and reducing the ban on Syrian immigrants to a 120-day suspension. Another executive order called for the immediate construction of a wall across the U.S.–Mexico border, the hiring of 5,000 new <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>agents</b> and 10,000 new immigration officers, and federal funding penalties for Sanctuary Cities.|$|E

25|$|There are {{significant}} dangers associated with illegal immigration including potential death when crossing the border. According to Chicano activist Roberto Martinez, since the 1994 implementation of an immigration-control effort called Operation Gatekeeper, immigrants {{have attempted to}} cross the border in more dangerous locations. Those crossing the border come unprepared, without food, water, proper clothing, or protection from the elements or dangerous animals; sometimes the immigrants are abandoned by those smuggling them. Deaths also occur while resisting arrest. In May 2010, the National Human Rights Commission in Mexico accused <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> of tasering illegal immigrant Anastasio Hernández-Rojas to death. Media reports that Hernández-Rojas started a physical altercation with patrol agents and later autopsy findings concluded that the suspect had trace amounts of methamphetamine in his blood levels which contributed to his death. The foreign ministry in Mexico City has demanded an explanation from San Diego and federal authorities, according to Tijuana newspapers. According to the US Border Agency, there were 987 assaults on US Border Agents in 2008 and there were a total of 12 people killed by agents in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure fentanyl powder was seized by <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> in California from a vehicle that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit fentanyl for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic fentanyl lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing fentanyl instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk fentanyl and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China.|$|E
25|$|Eight U.S. Department of Justice Camps (in Texas, Idaho, North Dakota, New Mexico, and Montana) held Japanese Americans, {{primarily}} non-citizens {{and their}} families. The camps were {{run by the}} Immigration and Naturalization Service, {{under the umbrella of}} the DOJ, and guarded by <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> rather than military police. The population of these camps included approximately 3,800 of the 5,500 Buddhist and Christian ministers, Japanese-language school instructors, newspaper workers, fishermen, and community leaders who had been accused of fifth column activity and arrested by the FBI after Pearl Harbor. (The remaining 1,700 were released to WRA relocation centers.) Immigrants and nationals of German and Italian ancestry were also held in these facilities, often in the same camps as Japanese Americans. Approximately 7,000 German Americans and 3,000 Italian Americans from Hawai'i and the U.S. mainland were interned in DOJ camps, along with 500 German seamen already in custody after being rescued from the SS Columbus in 1938. In addition 2,264 ethnic Japanese, 4,058 ethnic Germans, and 288 ethnic Italians were deported from 19 Latin American countries for a later-abandoned hostage exchange program with Axis countries or confinement in DOJ camps.|$|E

2500|$|Giffords {{worked to}} secure {{passage of the}} August 2010 bill to fund more <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> and {{surveillance}} technology for Arizona's border with Mexico. The legislation passed the House of Representatives only to be sent back by the U.S. Senate with reduced funding. Ultimately a $600-million bill was passed and signed into law. The bill was over $100million less than Giffords fought for, but she said, [...] "This funding signals a stronger federal commitment to protect those Americans {{who live and work}} near the border." ...|$|E
2500|$|The debate {{shifted from}} {{terrorist}} profiling to racial profiling of Mexicans, in which Ventura said when {{returning to the}} United States {{from his home in}} Mexico, two hours after crossing the border into Arizona, he witnessed <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents</b> demanding proof of citizenship on a highway in an effort to combat illegal immigration, actions that Ventura argued were violating the Constitution.

2500|$|In February 1942, the Department of Justice {{acquired}} 80-acres of {{land and}} an old Civilian Conservation Corps camp from the New Mexico State Penitentiary {{in order to establish}} a facility for enemy aliens. Unlike the War Relocation camps, which were much larger, the Santa Fe Internment Camp, or Camp Santa Fe, was guarded by <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>agents,</b> rather than soldiers. The original CCC camp could accommodate 450 people, but by March 1942 the facility had been expanded to house 1,400. Housing included wood and tarpaper buildings and 100 [...] "victory huts", however, most of the huts were later replaced by military style wooden barracks.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Santorum {{opposed the}} Senate's {{immigration}} reform proposal. Instead, Santorum {{stated that the}} U.S. should act to enforce currently existing laws.

He supports {{the construction of a}} barrier along the U.S.–Mexican border, {{an increase in the number}} of <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>agents</b> on the border, and the stationing of National Guard troops along the border. He also believes that illegal immigrants should be deported immediately when they commit crimes, and that undocumented immigrants should not receive benefits from the government. He believes English should be established as the national language in the United States. Santorum cites his own family's history (his father immigrated to the U.S. from Italy) as proof of how to immigrate [...] "the right way".|$|E
