50|$|An {{important}} goal of larger blade systems is to control blade weight. Since blade mass scales as the cube of the turbine radius, loading {{due to gravity}} constrains systems with larger blades. Gravitational loads include axial and tensile/ compressive loads (top/bottom of rotation) as well as bending (lateral positions). The magnitude of these loads fluctuates cyclically and the edgewise moments (see below) are reversed every 180° of rotation.Typical rotor speeds and design life are ~10rpm and 20 years, respectively, {{with the number of}} lifetime revolutions on the order of 10^8. Considering wind, it is expected that turbine blades go through ~10^9 loading cycles.Wind is another source of rotor <b>blade</b> <b>loading.</b> Lift causes bending in the flapwise direction (out of rotor plane) while air flow around the blade cause edgewise bending (in the rotor plane). Flapwise bending involves tension on the pressure (upwind) side and compression on the suction (downwind) side. Edgewise bending involves tension on the leading edge and compression on the trailing edge.|$|E
40|$|Detection of {{blade root}} moment sensor {{failures}} {{is an important}} problem for fault-tolerant individual pitch control, which {{plays a key role}} in reduction of uneven <b>blade</b> <b>loads</b> of large wind turbines. A new method for detection of blade root moment sensor failures which is based on variations induced by a vertical wind shear is described in this paper. The detection is associated with monitoring of statistical properties of the difference between amplitudes of the first harmonic of the <b>blade</b> <b>load,</b> which is calculated in two different ways. The first method is based on processing of the load sensor signal, which contains a number of harmonics. The first harmonic is recovered via least squares estimation of the <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> signal with harmonic regressor and strictly diagonally dominant (SDD) information matrix. The second method is a model-based method of estimation of the first harmonic, which relies on the <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> model and upwind speed measurements provided by multibeam Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). This is a new application for future LIDAR-enabled wind turbine technologies. Moreover, adaptation of the load model in a uniform wind field is proposed.

40|$|Distribution of the <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> {{is one of}} {{the design}} {{parameters}} for a cavitating inducer. For experimental investigation of the thermodynamic effect on the <b>blade</b> <b>load,</b> we conducted experiments in both cold water and liquid nitrogen. The thermodynamic effect on cavitation notably appears in this cryogenic fluid although it can be disregarded in cold water. In these experiments, the pressure rise along the blade tip was measured. In water, the pressure increased almost linearly from the leading edge to the trailing edge at higher cavitation number. After that, with a decrease of cavitation number, pressure rise occurred only near the trailing edge. On the other hand, in liquid nitrogen, the pressure distribution was similar to that in water at a higher cavitation number, even if the cavitation number as a cavitation parameter decreased. Because the cavitation growth is suppressed by the thermodynamic effect, the distribution of the <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> does not change even at lower cavitation number. By contrast, the pressure distribution in liquid nitrogen has the same tendency as that in water if the cavity length at the blade tip is taken as a cavitation indication. From these results, {{it was found that the}} shift of the <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> to the trailing edge depended on the increase of cavity length, and that the distribution of <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> was indicated only by the cavity length independent of the thermodynamic effect...|$|R

Parallel performance of the code is presented, and grid dependence of the computed <b>blade</b> <b>loads</b> and wake analysed, by considering wake capturing, total <b>blade</b> <b>load</b> and sectional load variation around the azimuth.

40|$|Wind turbine {{design codes}} for calculating <b>blade</b> <b>loads</b> are usually {{based on a}} blade element {{momentum}} (BEM) approach. Since wind turbine rotors often operate in off-design conditions, such as yawed flow, several engineering methods {{have been developed to}} take into account such conditions. An essential feature of a BEM code is the coupling of local <b>blade</b> element <b>loads</b> with an external (induced) velocity field determined with momentum theory through the angle of attack. Local <b>blade</b> <b>loads</b> follow directly from blade pressure measurements as performed in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) phase IV campaign, but corresponding angles of attack cannot (on principle) be measured. By developing a free wake vortex method using measured local <b>blade</b> <b>loads,</b> time-dependent angle of attack and induced velocity distributions are reconstructed. In a previous paper, a method was described for deriving such distributions in conjunction with blade pressure measurements for the NREL phase VI wind turbine in axial (non-yawed) conditions. In this paper, the same method is applied to investigate yawed conditions on the same turbine. The study considered different operating conditions in yaw in both attached and separated flows over the blades. The derived free wake geometry solutions are used to determine induced velocity distributions at the rotor blade. These are then used to determine the local (azimuth time dependent) angle of attack, as well as the corresponding lift and drag for each blade section. The derived results are helpful to develop better engineering models for wind turbine design codes. peer-reviewe...|$|R
