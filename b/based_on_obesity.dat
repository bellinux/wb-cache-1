5000|$|A {{maternal}} insult (also {{referred to}} as a [...] "yo mama" [...] joke) is a reference to a person's mother through the use of phrases such as [...] "your mother" [...] or other regional variants, frequently used to insult the target by way of their mother. Used as an insult, [...] "your mother ..." [...] preys on widespread sentiments of filial piety, making the insult particularly and globally offensive. [...] "Your mother" [...] can be combined with most types of insults, although suggestions of promiscuity are particularly common. Insults <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity,</b> incest, age, race, poverty, poor hygiene, unattractiveness, or stupidity may also be used. Compared to other types of insults, [...] "your mother" [...] insults are especially likely to incite violence. Slang variants such as [...] "yo mama", [...] "yo momma", [...] "yer ma", [...] "ya mum", [...] "your mum" [...] or [...] "your mom" [...] are sometimes used, depending on the local dialect. Insults involving [...] "your mother" [...] are commonly used when playing the dozens.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} overweight and obesity based on Body Mass Index (BMI) values among children in Tehran. Cross-sectional survey of a randomized sample of school aged children in Tehran. A total of 3104 {{boys and girls in}} 3 aged groups with mean age 6, 8 and 10 years. The data consisted of parents-reported measures of height and weight that were obtained from questionnaires, and then BMI [weight (kg) / height (m) 2] was calculated. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher than expected as related to recent Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts in comparison to a recent International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) approach. These differences were higher among Iranian girls than boys. While obesity prevalence might not be important as a definition of IOTF and CDC, but rapid increases of obesity in recent years are potentially dangerous.

40|$|Background: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) often induces reduced ovulation, infertility and hyperandrogenism. Many PCOS cases manifest {{different degrees}} of obesity. The increased body mass index (BMI) may interfere with a successful reproduction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of increasing BMI on anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) gene expression in granulosa cells and also biochemical factors among PCOS cases. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 80 patients (mean age 20 - 35 y with PCOS or other non-PCOS infertility disorders) referred to Tabriz-Alzahra Fertility Center. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> degree and its signs, the cases were divided to four groups. In the same day of isolating oocytes, granulosa cells and serum were taken for gene expression and the analysis of biochemistry factors, respectively. Results: AMH gene expression level were higher in PCOS compared to normal cases (P< 0. 05). While increasing BMI in the patients didn’t show a significant decrease of AMH gene expression (r=- 0. 07), a significant positive correlation was observed between AMH and insulin resistance (r= 0. 34, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: AMH gene expression in PCOS cases is affected by the disease phenotype. Insulin resistance plays an important role in increasing serum AMH...|$|E

Methods: We chose 20 villages from 118 by cluster and simple sampling. All of 25 - 60 months old children in this area were considered in this study. Sample size was 1569 cases (632 =Sisstanish and 937 =Non- Sisstanish). Height, weight and personal identification were recorded by questioner. BMI percentile and under - 1 sd, - 2 sd and - 3 sd from NCHS were used for comparison. X 2 test and T. test were used to analyze by software SPSS. Results: Sisstanish children were 900 g lighter and 4. 39 cm taller than non-Sisstanish among all of age groups. T. test is significant between two groups based on weight and height (P< 0. 05). Stunting and underweight were observed in Sisstanish group 23 % and 5. 9 % respectively more than in non-Sisstanish by - 2 sd criterion. There is a significant difference between two groups by stunting (P< 0. 05). Overweight (1. 52 %) and obesity (12. 4 %) were shown in Sisstanish group more than in non-Sisstanish group and Statistical differences is significant between them <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Secular growth in two groups is disproportionate and in Non-Sisstanish group is better than Sisstanish group. Sisstanish children suffer from severe height deficit and BMI high.

40|$|BACKGROUND: US {{breast cancer}} {{mortality}} is declining, {{but thousands of}} women still die each year. METHODS: Two established simu-lation models examine 6 strategies that include increased screening and/or treatment or elimination of obesity versus continuation of current patterns. The models use common national data on incidence and obesity prevalence, competing causes of death, mammog-raphy characteristics, treatment effects, and survival/cure. Parameters are modified <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> (defined as BMI 30 kg/m 2). Outcomes are presented for the year 2025 among women aged 251 and include numbers of cases, deaths, mammograms and false-positives; age-adjusted incidence and mortality; breast cancer mortality reduction and deaths averted; and probability of dying of breast cancer. RESULTS: If current patterns continue, the models project {{that there would be}} about 50, 100 - 57, 400 (range across models) annual breast cancer deaths in 2025. If 90 % of women were screened annually from ages 40 to 54 and biennially from ages 55 to 99 (or death), then 5100 - 6100 fewer deaths would occur versus current patterns, but incidence, mammograms, and false-posi-tives would increase. If all women received the indicated systemic treatment (with no screening change), then 11, 400 - 14, 500 more deaths would be averted versus current patterns, but increased toxicity could occur. If 100 % received screening plus indicated ther-apy, there would be 18, 100 - 20, 400 fewer deaths. Eliminating obesity yields 3300 - 5700 fewer breast cancer deaths versus continua-tion of current obesity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Maximal reductions in breast cancer deaths could be achieved through optimizing treatment use, followed by increasing screening use and obesity prevention. Cancer 2013; 119 : 2541 - 8.

40|$|Objectives: Metabolic {{syndrome}} is {{a cluster of}} risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Associations between metabolic syndrome and several types of cancer have recently been documented. Methods: We analyzed the sample cohort data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2002, with a follow-up period extending to 2013. The cohort data included 99 565 individuals {{who participated in the}} health examination program and whose data were therefore present in the cohort database. The metabolic risk profile of each participant was assessed <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity,</b> high serum glucose and total cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure. The occurrence of cancer was identified using Korean National Health Insurance claims data. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age group, smoking status, alcohol intake, and regular exercise. Results: A total of 5937 cases of cancer occurred during a mean follow-up period of 10. 4 years. In men with a high-risk metabolic profile, the risk of colon cancer was elevated (HR, 1. 40; 95 % CI, 1. 14 to 1. 71). In women, a high-risk metabolic profile was associated with a significantly increased risk of gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (HR, 2. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 24 to 3. 42). Non-significantly increased risks were observed in men for pharynx, larynx, rectum, and kidney cancer, and in women for colon, liver, breast, and ovarian cancer. Conclusions: The findings of this study support the previously suggested association between metabolic syndrome and the risk of several cancers. A high-risk metabolic profile may be an important risk factor for colon cancer in Korean men and gallbladder and biliary tract cancer in Korean women...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{changes in}} nasal {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (nCPAP) pressure requirements across time in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), and whether routine retitrations are indicated. BACKGROUND: Most sleep laboratories perform one nCPAP titration, although some authors have found changes in pressures with time. A cohort {{of patients with}} OSA in a randomised controlled trial of nCPAP provided us with data on changes in titration pressures with time. METHODS: One hundred and one patients with symptomatic OSA (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > or = 10, and > 10 episodes/h of > 4 % dips in SaO(2) overnight) were recruited to a 1 month trial comparing real (autotitrated) and placebo nCPAP. At 1 month all patients were titrated and received real nCPAP thereafter. Eighty five were retitrated at about 6 months. RESULTS: Average pressures did not change between the initial value and 1 month (95 th centile, 8. 47 (SD 3. 00), 8. 94 (2. 85) cm H(2) O), although there were large individual changes (mean difference, + 0. 47, SD 2. 30, range - 5 to + 6 cm H(2) O). There was a small fall at 6 months (mean difference - 0. 68, SD 2. 60, range - 6 to + 6 cm H(2) O, P< 0. 03) with no suggestion that the changes from 1 - 6 months were clinically important. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that routine nCPAP retitrations are not necessary. In conjunction with other published data, the night to night variation we found implies that a nCPAP calibration using an algorithm (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> and OSA severity) might be as clinically successful as conventional one night titrations.

40|$|The role of {{nutrition}} {{is especially important}} in certain ‘lifestyle’ diseases that impact disproportionately on ethnic minority populations. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the evidence of risk, health outcomes and interventions for certain diseases that affect the UK’s largest ethnic minority group (South Asians) in order to help professionals better address the needs of this diverse population. Research evidence is presented on factors influencing access to services by ethnic minority populations and the changing UK policy background for public health and preventive care. The available research <b>base</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity,</b> diabetes and CVD is discussed. Conditions such as type 2 diabetes, which are more prevalent among the South Asian population, are associated with poorer health outcomes and appear to exhibit links to diet and nutrition that start in childhood or even before birth; all making preventive care important. Obesity is a major risk factor and it appears that BMI thresholds may need to be lower for South Asians. Targeted interventions to improve diet and outcomes in the South Asian population also appear promising. Recent moves to promote access to evidence of ethnicity and health and to improve the cultural competence of organisations are discussed. Health professionals will increasingly need to promote lifestyle changes in a manner that meets the needs of a diverse population in order to address future public health challenges. Nutritionists and other professionals will need to ensure that interventions are culturally appropriate and involve engagement with extended family members and communities...|$|R
40|$|Internationally, {{socio-economic}} trends {{reinforce the}} complex physiological mechanisms that favour positive energy balance, {{leading to an}} accumulation of excess body weight and associated metabolic disorders. This so-called 'obesogenic environment' is characterised by increasing accessibility and affordability of energy-dense foods and declining levels of physical activity. In {{the face of such}} rapidly-rising obesity rates there is general consensus that strategies to address trends in weight gain must go forwards in the absence of complete evidence of cause or effective prevention strategy. Thus, strategy implementation and evaluation must contribute to, as well as be informed by, the evidence base. Social marketing research and practice has a track record that strongly indicates that it can contribute to both the evolving knowledge <b>base</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> and overweight control policy and the development of effective intervention strategies. Social marketing draws pragmatically on many disciplines to bring about voluntary behaviour change as well as requisite supporting policy and environmental change. Key objectives include: generating insights into the drivers of current behaviour patterns; important barriers to change; client-oriented approaches to new desirable diet and lifestyle choices. Social marketing recognises that target clients have the power to ensure success or failure of obesity control policies. Social marketing seeks to identify genuine exchange of benefits for target adopters of behaviour change and the advocates of change, and how they may be developed and offered within an appropriate relevant context. Social marketing adopts a cyclical approach of learning, strategic development and evaluation, and therefore is well placed to integrate with the multi-disciplinary demands of obesity prevention strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity among American children and adults has increased substantially {{over the past few}} decades. This research used an ecological framework to examine the relationships between biological, dietary, sociocultural and behavioral factors to determine how these factors influenced obesity status during adolescence in West Philadelphia. Correlates, values, and health risks of obesity were addressed. In Phase I of the study, obesity-related attitudes, anthropometric, dietary, and sociodemographic factors were measured for 392 West Philadelphia adolescents (11 - 15 years). Data were compared to two other groups of Philadelphia adolescents of comparable socioeconomic status and ethnic background measured in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Phase II was based on 32 matched-pairs of obese (BMI and triceps skinfold > 95 th percentile of NHANES I) and non-obese (BMI and triceps skinfold between the 15 th and 85 th percentiles of NHANES I) female adolescents selected from the Phase I sample <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> status and matched according to stature and age. Adolescents were compared on the following measures: physical activity, sedentary behavior, dietary intake, eating attitudes, health behavior knowledge, body image, self-esteem, and maturation status. Findings from Phase I include a threefold increase (males) and a fourfold increase (females) in the {{prevalence of}} obesity {{over the last two decades}} that was not concurrent with an increase in body fat centralization. The West Philadelphia adolescents had macronutrient intakes that were higher than the RDA and higher than age- and sex-specific data from NHANES III (Life Sciences Research Office, 1995). Micronutrient status was excellent, with the exception of calcium, zinc, fiber, and vitamins A and D. In Phase II, physical activity and television watching emerged as the most important contributory factors to obesity status. There were no statistically significant matched-pair differences in macronutrient and micronutrient intakes, self-esteem, eating attitudes, health behavior knowledge, body image, or maturation status of these adolescents. Findings indicate that sociocultural factors in the urban environment may promote obesity for these adolescents. This research suggests that future intervention strategies include attention to physical activity, television watching habits, and sociocultural factors in the urban environment. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT THE USE OF METABOLOMICS TO INVESTIGATE BIOMARKERS PROFILES AS POTENTIAL EARLY RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES by JENNELLE ARNEW MAY 2012 Advisor: Dr. Smiti Gupta Major: Nutrition and Food Science Degree: Masters of Science Type 2 Diabetes affects an {{estimated}} 17. 5 million {{individuals in the}} United States and {{is considered to be}} one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. To date, the exact cause of type 2 diabetes remains unclear, however, it is considered to be an interplay between environmental and genetic factors. Emerging technologies for metabolomics analysis increases the capacity to detect the onset of disease or ideally, the pre-diseased state. Metabolomics has the potential to find early metabolic changes related to diabetes progression prior to many clinical symptoms. Although this technology is considered to be in its infancy many believe that metabolomics strategies can have an impact on the discovery of pathological biomarkers for diabetes progression. Given this emerging technology that is available, the increasing burden of diabetes, earlier identification of ¡®at risk¡¯ individuals is particularly important. The objective of this study was to determine if metabolomics analytical techniques could identify differences in the metabolic profiles of persons at risk for developing diabetes. A heterogeneous non-diabetic sample of persons with and without risk factors for development of diabetes were recruited for this pilot study. A standard questionnaire was conducted to assess risk factors for diabetes. Fasting blood and urine samples were collected and frozen at - 800 C. Bivariate correlations were determined to investigate the linear relationship between the risk factors. Urinary metabolite profiles were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectra. The processed, digitized NMR spectral data was analyzed using multivariate data analysis software, SIMCA P+. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) Score Plot showed a clear separation between the urinary metabolomic profiles of subject based on a BMI ¡Ý 27 kg/m 2. PLS correlation plot showed a significant correlation between the urinary profiles between BMI and fasting blood sugar in this non-diabetic population. The data suggests and in agreement with the hypothesis, that 1 H NMR was able to detect changes in the urinary profiles of a non-heterogeneous non-diabetic population with the greatest degree of discrimination based on BMI of 27 kg/m 2. Based on current clinical practices, the identification of the metabolites causing discriminating in the urinary profiles <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>obesity</b> may be a relevant focus for predicting risk in a non-diabetic population. This study was considered a pilot for a future project and was not designed to provide a high degree of precision. However, this project does provide greater insight that metabolomics is a sensitive tool that is able to differentiate between the metabolic profiles of human urinary profiles based on BMI, thus making it important to use the project characteristics for a larger trial...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{has reached}} {{epidemic}} proportions in the United States and other developed nations. In the United States, 27 % of adults are obese {{and an additional}} 34 % are overweight. Research {{in the past decade}} has shown that genetic influences clearly predispose some individuals to obesity. The marked increase in prevalence, however, appears to be attributable to a toxic environment that implicitly discourages physical activity while explicitly encouraging the consumption of supersized portions of high-fat, high-sugar foods. Management of the obesity epidemic will require a two-pronged approach. First, better treatments, including behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions, are needed for individuals who are already obese. The second and potentially more promising approach is to prevent the develop-ment of obesity by tackling the toxic environment. This will require bold public policy initiatives such as regulating food advertising directed at children. The authors call not for the adoption of a specific policy initiative, but instead propose that policy research, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> viewing <b>obesity</b> as a public health problem, become a central focus of research.

Obesity is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this respect, we decided to examine the effect of the subgroups of weight on cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done in 2006 using the data obtained by the Iranian Healthy Heart Program (IHHP) and <b>based</b> <b>on</b> classification of <b>obesity</b> by the World Health Organization (WHO). In this study, the samples were tested <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the Framingham risk score, Metabolic Measuring Score (MMS) and classification of obesity. Chi-square and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 12514 people with a mean age of 38 participated in this study. 6. 8 % of women and 14 % of men had university degrees (higher than diploma). Obesity was seen in women more than men: 56. 4 % of women and 40 % of men had a Body Mass Index of (BMI) ≥ 25 Kg/m 2. 13...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} (SDB), especially obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA), has frequent complications include hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance <b>based</b> <b>on</b> abdominal <b>obesity</b> or excess visceral fat (called Syndrome Z). OSA is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The clinical characteristics of Japanese OSA subjects with OSA remain unclear. The present study investigated prevalence and predictive factors of intracoronary stenosis detected by multislice computed tomography (MSCT) in Japanese male subjects with SDB/OSA. Findings The study (O-VFStudy) subjects were 39 Japanese men with SDB/OSA who underwent all-night cardiorespiratory monitoring with fully attended polysomnography, and moreover both fat computed tomography (CT) scan and 64 -row MSCT coronary angiography. The prevalence of coronary stenosis in this selected population with SDB/OSA was 15 %. Logistic regression analysis showed {{a significant relationship between}} age-adjusted CAD and metabolic syndrome (p p = 0. 033), and lower levels of serum adiponectin (4. 5 ± 0. 6 versus 6. 4 ± 0. 6 μg/mL, p = 0. 014), compared with groups without the metabolic syndrome. Conclusions The present study describes that the prevalence of greater than 50 % intracoronary stenotic lesions detected by MSCT was 15 % and the metabolic syndrome was correlated with intracoronary stenosis detected by MSCT in Japanese SDB/OSA subjects.

40|$|To get {{insight into}} still elusive pathomechanisms of {{pediatric}} obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) we explored the interplay among GC-MS studied urinary metabolomic signature, gut liver axis (GLA) abnormalities, and food preferences (Kid-Med). Intestinal permeability (IP), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance were investigated in forty children (mean age 9. 8 years) categorized as normal weight (NW) or obese (body mass index 95 th percentile, respectively) ± ultrasonographic bright liver and hypertransaminasemia (NAFLD). SIBO was increased in all obese children (p = 0. 0022), IP preferentially {{in those with}} NAFLD (p = 0. 0002). The partial least-square discriminant analysis of urinary metabolome correctly allocated children <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their <b>obesity,</b> NAFLD, visceral fat, pathological IP and SIBO. Compared to NW, obese children had (1) higher levels of glucose/ 1 -methylhistidine, the latter more markedly in NAFLD patients; and (2) lower levels of xylitol, phenyl acetic acid and hydroquinone, the latter especially in children without NAFLD. The metabolic pathways of BCAA and/or their metabolites correlated with excess of visceral fat centimeters (leucine/oxo-valerate), and more deranged IP and SIBO (valine metabolites). Urinary metabolome analysis contributes to define a metabolic fingerprint of pediatric obesity and related NAFLD, by identifying metabolic pathways/metabolites reflecting typical obesity dietary habits and GLA perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Administrative health {{databases}} are {{a valuable}} research tool to assess health care utilization at the population level. However, {{their use in}} obesity research limited {{due to the lack}} of data on body weight. A potential workaround is to use the ICD code of obesity to identify obese individuals. The objective of the current study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of an ICD code-based diagnosis of obesity from administrative health data relative to the gold standard measured BMI. Methods Linkage of a population-based survey with anthropometric measures in elementary school children in 2003 with longitudinal administrative health data (physician visits and hospital discharges 1992 - 2006) from the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Measured <b>obesity</b> was defined <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the CDC cut-offs applied to the measured BMI. An ICD code-based diagnosis obesity was defined as one or more ICD- 9 (278) or ICD- 10 code (E 66 -E 68) of obesity from a physician visit or a hospital stay. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and health care cost estimates <b>based</b> <b>on</b> measured <b>obesity</b> and ICD-based obesity were compared. Results The sensitivity of an ICD code-based obesity diagnosis was 7. 4 % using ICD codes between 2002 and 2004. Those correctly identified had a higher BMI and had higher health care utilization and costs. Conclusions An ICD diagnosis of obesity in Canadian administrative health data grossly underestimates the true prevalence of childhood obesity and overestimates the health care cost differential between obese and non-obese children. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether lower motor performance scores can be full attributed to poor coordination, or whether weight related morphological constraints may also affect motor performance.

Participants completed the 10 -item McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND) at the 10 and 14 year follow-up. The prevalence of overweight and obese participants classified with mild or moderate motor difficulties was not different from the normal weight group at 10 years (χ 2 = 5. 8 p=. 215), but higher at 14 years (χ 2 = 11. 3 p=. 023).

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of action of the combination therapy, naltrexone/bupropion (NB), for obesity has not been fully described to date. Weight loss attempts rarely result in long-term success. This is likely a result of complex interactions among multiple peripheral and CNS systems that defend against weight loss, and may explain the overwhelming lack of effective obesity treatments. NB is an investigational combination therapy for obesity that was developed <b>based</b> <b>on</b> evidence that <b>obesity</b> involves alterations in the hypothalamic melanocortin system as well as brain reward systems that influence food craving and mood. Naltrexone and bupropion both have actions in these brain regions that may cause them to influence food intake, food craving, {{and other aspects of}} eating behavior that affect body weight. We review the individual actions of naltrexone and bupropion in brain hypothalamic and reward systems, and describe the current in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence for how NB influences food intake and produces weight loss...|$|R

We delineated the pathological relevance of iNAMPT of proximal tubular cells. The expression of iNAMPT was reduced by TGFb in diabetic kidney disease. We also analyzed regulatory mechanism for the promoter activity of iNMPT genes. In diabetic kidney disease, iNAMPT expression was downregulated which contributed to the tissue fibrotic changes through the reduced expressions of Sirt 6. We also investigated the role of NMMT in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrotic changes of both kidney and liver. NMMT-overexpressing mice exhibited prominent liver fibrosis but not renal fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was demonstrated to result from the decreased turnover of methionine metabolism, which lead to methyl-donor deficiency and epigenetic induction of CTGF gene in the liver...|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the reliability of body mass index based (BMI) cutoff values in diagnosing obesity among Sri Lankan children. Methods Height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) in 282 children were measured. Total body water was determined by deuterium dilution and fat mass (FM) derived using age and gender specific constants. A percentage FM of 30 % for girls and 25 % for boys were considered as cutoff levels for obesity. Results Two hundred and eighty two children (M/F: 158 / 124) were studied and 99 (80 %) girls and 72 (45. 5 %) boys were obese <b>based</b> <b>on</b> % body fat. Eight (6. 4 %) girls and nine (5. 7 %) boys were obese <b>based</b> <b>on</b> International <b>Obesity</b> Task Force (IOTF) cutoff values. Percentage FM and WC centile charts were able to diagnose a significant proportion of children as true obese children. The FM and BMI were closely associated in both girls (r= 0. 82, p < 0. 001) and boys (r= 0. 87, p < 0. 001). Percentage FM and BMI had a very low but significant association; girls (r= 0. 32, p < 0. 001) and boys (r= 0. 68, p < 0. 001). FM had a significant association with WC and HC. BMI based cutoff values had a specificity of 100 % but a very low sensitivity, varying between 8 % and 23. 6 %. Conclusions BMI is a poor indicator of the percentage fat and the commonly used cutoff values were not sensitive to detect cases of childhood obesity in Sri Lankan children...|$|R
40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject Overweight and obesity {{prevalence}} estimates among children <b>based</b> <b>on</b> International <b>Obesity</b> Task Force definitions are substantially lower than estimates <b>based</b> <b>on</b> World Health Organization definitions. Presence of a north-south gradient with {{the highest level of}} overweight found in southern European countries. Intercountry comparisons of overweight and obesity in primary-school children in Europe <b>based</b> <b>on</b> measured data lack a similar data collection protocol. What this study adds Unique dataset <b>on</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> measured weights and heights in 6 - 9 -year-old children from 12 European countries using a harmonized surveillance methodology. Because of the use of a consistent data collection protocol, it is possible to perform valid multiple comparisons between countries. It demonstrates wide variations in overweight and obesity prevalence estimates among primary-school children between European countries and regions. BACKGROUND: Nutritional surveillance in school-age children, using measured weight and height, is not common in the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO Regional Office for Europe has therefore initiated the WHO European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative. OBJECTIVE: To present the anthropometric results of data collected in 2007 / 2008 and to investigate whether there exist differences across countries and between the sexes. METHODS: Weight and height were measured in 6 - 9 -year-old children in 12 countries. Prevalence of overweight, obesity, stunting, thinness and underweight as well as mean Z-scores of anthropometric indices of height, weight and body mass index were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 168 [*] 832 children were included in the analyses and a school participation rate of more than 95 % was obtained in 8 out of 12 countries. Stunting, underweight and thinness were rarely prevalent. However, 19. 3 - 49. 0 % of boys and 18. 4 - 42. 5 % of girls were overweight (including <b>obesity</b> and <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the 2007 WHO growth reference). The prevalence of obesity ranged from 6. 0 to 26. 6 % among boys and from 4. 6 to 17. 3 % among girls. Multi-country comparisons suggest the presence of a north-south gradient with the highest level of overweight found in southern European countries. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight among 6 - 9 -year-old children is a serious public health concern and its variation across the European Region highly depends on the country. Comparable monitoring of child growth is possible across Europe and should be emphasized in national policies and implemented as part of action plans...|$|R
