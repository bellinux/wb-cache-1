5|$|On 2 July 1960 Butlin {{planned to}} open his holiday camp at Bognor, but because of {{flooding}} it was not ready. Butlin offered his patrons {{the chance to be}} re-sited at Clacton or to stay and help complete the camp's construction. A number opted to stay and help, and received a free <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> as a reward. Once opened, the camp quickly became popular, accommodating around 5,000 campers and another 5,000 day visitors.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{extension}} of the Metropolitan Railway to Ruislip, and the resulting influx of visitors to the area, Albert Cross built a bungalow from where teas were served to day-trippers. This became a success and Cross had the building expanded, which soon became the Orchard Hotel. Between 1933 and 1971 it became an Ansells licensed bar and well known high class restaurant. It then became a Beefeater steak house, which it remains, and was recently extended with a Premier Inn hotel. During the Battle of Britain, the Orchard was very popular with the pilots of No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron stationed at RAF Northolt, who celebrated many of their successes in battle there. The owner was known to open a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> for each German aircraft shot down by the squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

The club owner offered to revoke the ban after the 2007–08 season {{and to give}} Stokes a {{complimentary}} <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Stokes then scored his first Premier League goal; a last-minute winner against Derby County that took Sunderland out of the relegation zone. Before {{the start of the}} 2008–09 season Stokes lost the Sunderland number 9 shirt and was handed the squad number 44 instead. On 23 September 2008, Stokes scored two late goals to level a League Cup tie against Northampton Town.|$|E

25|$|Designers Bruno and Franz Steffen piloted the {{aircraft}} themselves {{on its first}} test flight on 24 May 1915. They ended this flight prematurely because of overheating in the gearboxes, and subsequent tests revealed other defects such as excessive vibration in the drive system. With these problems addressed, the R.I was ready for its Idflieg acceptance flights in June 1915. Bruno Steffen ferried the three-person inspection team, plus a number of passengers, from Neumünster to Döberitz. He had even placed two armchairs and a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> in the cabin for the occasion. The R.I reached Döberitz safely and made around twenty-four test flights before it was accepted by the military on 26 July 1915.|$|E
25|$|The average <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> {{contains}} enough {{carbon dioxide}} to potentially produce 49 million bubbles. (Wine expert Tom Stevenson puts the number at 250 million.) The bubbles initially form at 20 micrometers {{in diameter and}} expand as they gain buoyancy and rise to the surface. When they reach the surface they are approximately 1 millimeter in size. It is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up alcohol intoxication by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster. A study conducted at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom gave subjects equal amounts of flat and sparkling Champagne which contained the same levels of alcohol. After 5 minutes following consumption, the group that had the sparkling wine had 54 milligrams of alcohol in their blood while the group that had the same sparkling wine, only flat, had 39 milligrams.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, former Miss Virginia USA Tai Collins {{claimed to}} have {{had an affair with}} Robb seven years earlier, {{although}} her allegations were never corroborated and she offered no proof of the affair to reporters. Robb denied having an affair with her, merely admitting to sharing a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and receiving a massage from her in his hotel room on one occasion. Soon after making the allegations, Collins earned an undisclosed amount for posing nude for Playboy magazine. There were also rumors that during the time he was governor, Robb was present at parties in Virginia Beach where cocaine was used. These rumors were never proven, despite intense investigation by reporters and political operatives. He strongly denied this when the issue was raised during his 1988 campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robb so vehemently denied the cocaine allegation that he {{claimed to have}} never seen cocaine.|$|E

25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is just part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on top of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b>|$|E

50|$|Upon Hopetoun's {{impending}} departure, he donated {{money and}} 25 dozen <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> entrusted to Fleming, for distribution to the unemployed. Several commentators {{of the period}} saw this as a round-about slap at the establishment for refusing to pay Hopetoun what he thought he needed. Fleming duly distributed the gifts to the unemployed according to a register: One shilling to each married man and 6d to each single man who attended on 24 June 1902. The following day the <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Champagne,</b> along with beer from 6 hogsheads donated by Shamrock Brewery, were distributed by Fleming, (who neither smoked or drank).

500|$|In the biographic Mad World (2009), Paula Byrne {{said that}} the common view of Evelyn Waugh as a [...] "snobbish misanthrope" [...] is a caricature; he asks: [...] "Why would a man, who was so unpleasant, be so beloved by such a wide circle of friends?" [...] His {{generosity}} to individual persons and causes, especially Catholic causes, extended to small gestures; after his libel-court victory over Nancy Spain, he sent her a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Hastings said that Waugh's outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at [...] "finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity". Besides mocking others, Waugh mocked himself—the elderly buffer, [...] "crusty colonel" [...] image, which he presented in later life, was a comic impersonation, and not his true self.|$|E
500|$|Filming of The Motion Pictures {{first scene}} began on August 7, 1978. A few ad-libbed ceremonies were {{performed}} before the cameras rolled; Roddenberry gave Wise his baseball cap, emblazoned with [...] "Enterprise" [...] in gold lettering (the cap {{was a gift}} from the captain of the nuclear carrier Enterprise.) Wise and Roddenberry then cracked a special breakaway <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on the bridge set (there was no liquid inside, as flying champagne would have damaged the readied set.) The scene planned was the chaotic mess aboard the Enterprise bridge as the crew readies the ship for space travel; Wise directed 15 takes into the late afternoon before he was content with the scene. The first day's shots used [...] of film; [...] were considered [...] "good", [...] were judged [...] "no good", and [...] were wasted; only one and one-eighth pages had been shot.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{elements}} were suggested by other staff members, with Robert Wolfe naming Colonel Anastasia Komananov and Behr changing Suzie Luvsitt to Mona Luvsitt. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was later not pleased with the James Bond-style approach, and when Bashir's spy program appeared in the later episode [...] "A Simple Investigation", the references were more generic. Dennis Madalone managed to save some time during the production {{as one of the}} shots involved Bashir seeing Falcon approach him from behind by seeing his reflection in a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> After time was already scheduled to attempt the shot, Madalone explained to the director that he could take the filmed sequence and digitally manipulate it onto the bottle. Madalone was also responsible for firing a cork from a bottle at Colm Meaney's head from off screen to make it appear as if Bashir did it, and managed to do it on the first take.|$|E

500|$|At the Byrnes' home, Greg meets Pam's {{overbearing}} father Jack, mother Dina {{and their}} cat, Jinxy, a seal-point peke-faced Himalayan with an all-black tail. Jack takes an instant dislike to Greg and openly criticizes {{him for his}} choice of career as a male nurse and whatever else he sees as a difference between Greg and the Byrnes family. Greg tries to impress Jack, but his efforts fail after he recites the lyrics to [...] "Day by Day" [...] from [...] "Godspell" [...] when asked to say grace at dinner (as he is Jewish), making up a story of milking a cat, finding out Pam was engaged and (while popping the cork of a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne)</b> accidentally breaking an urn holding the remains of Jack's mother which Jinx then urinates in.
