40|$|In the {{previous}} chapter we considered elastostatic equilibria {{in which the}} forces acting on elements of an elastic solid were balanced so that the solid remained at rest. When this equilibrium is disturbed, the solid will undergo accelerations. This {{is the subject of}} this chapter — Elastodynamics. In Sec. 11. 2), we derive the equations of motion for elastic media, paying particular attention to the underlying conservation laws, and focusing especially on elastodynamic waves. We show that there are two distinct wave modes that propagate in a uniform, isotropic solid, longitudinal waves and shear waves, and both are nondispersive (their phase speeds are independent of frequency). A major use of elastodynamics is in structural engineering, where one encounters vibrations (standing waves) on the beams that support buildings and bridges. In Sec. 11. 3 we discuss the types of waves that propagate on <b>bars,</b> <b>rods</b> and beams and find that the boundary conditions at the free transverse surfaces make the waves dispersive.

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{reinforcing}} elements {{have been used}} for construction of reinforced soil retaining wall i. e., sheets, grids, meshes, strips, <b>bars,</b> <b>rods</b> etc. In ultimate limit state design, considering the internal stability analysis, the reinforced soil wall may fail in tension/rupture or pullout type of failure. Pullout tests results are commonly used to predict actual field pullout performance of reinforcements. Various authors have studied different kinds of shapes and sizes of reinforcements for pullout test, but much attention has not been given to conduct pullout test with cellular reinforcement like geocell. Though Soil reinforcement using of cellular reinforcement (geocell) has been utilized successfully in many other areas of geotechnical engineering, there is still need to study the probable use of cellular reinforcement in reinforced soil retaining wall. In the present paper, cellular type geometry of reinforcement is proposed for reinforced soil applications. Pullout analysis of such reinforcement is performed. Also, the pullout test conditions are simulated in finite element method, with the help of readymade software, Plaxis-V 8 and the outputs are visualized. The results are found supportive to the assumptions made in the analysis...|$|E

40|$|Bending is {{the uniform}} {{straining}} of material around a straight axis {{and is used}} commonly in various sheet metal industrial products. Since all materials have a finite modulus of elasticity, plastic deformation is followed by some elastic recovery when the load is removed. In bending processes this phenomenon is called springback. Springback occurs not only in flat sheets or plate, but also in <b>bars,</b> <b>rods,</b> etc., {{and is one of}} the key factors to influence the quality of bent sheet metal parts. The amount of springback should be known in order to produce bent sheet metal parts within acceptable tolerance limits. There are many parameters which have influence on springback, one of them is strain hardening. The aim of the experimental work, described in the paper, was to determine the influence of the effective strain to springback ratio and springback angle of sheet metal specimens. Many experiments have been done to find out the amount of springback for different values of effective strain and different thickness of metal sheets. Different specimens were used for the experimental determination of springback ratio and springback angle and were bent in a special bending tool. Statistical analysis methods were used for determination of mathematical models. This study is considered to be helpful to understand springback phenomena in metal forming processes...|$|E

This goal was attained and maximum strain levels of about 90 % of the CFRP failure strain were recorded in this composite material, revealing that the NSM technique is also very effective to increase the flexural resistance of RC beams. The effectiveness of externally bonded reinforcing (EBR) and NSM techniques to increase the flexural resistance of masonry panels is also assessed. In the EBR technique the CFRP laminates are externally bonded to the concrete joints of the panel, while in the NSM technique the CFRP laminates are fixed into precut slits on the panel concrete joints.
