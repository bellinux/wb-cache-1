40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original research {{initiated by the}} monitoring needs of a semiconductor production plant. The industrial operations rely on an Information Technology (IT) system, and several time series data are controlled statistically. Unfortunately, these variables often contain outliers, as well as structural changes due to external decisions in the IT activity. As a consequence, {{it has been observed}} that the monitoring results obtained with standard techniques could be severely biased. This paper presents some contributions to overcome such difficulties. A new monitoring method is proposed, based on robust Holt-Winters smoothing algorithm, and coupled with a relearning procedure for structural <b>breaks</b> <b>detection.</b> Such a method is flexible enough for a large-scale industrial application. We evaluate its performances through simulations studies, and show its usefulness in industrial real applications for univariate and multivariate time series.

40|$|In this article, we {{contribute}} to the discussion of volatility persistence {{in the presence of}} sudden changes. We follow previous research, particularly Wang and Moore (2009), who analysed stock market returns in five Central and Eastern European countries using the Iterated Cumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) algorithm for detecting multiple breaks and the test (IT) proposed by Inclán and Tiao (1994). We complement this analysis by using the κ 1 and κ 2 statistic introduced by Sansó et al. (2004), which lead us to the hypothesis that the estimated persistence in volatility depends inversely on the number of breakpoints in volatility. We explored this claim through a simulation study, where by randomizing an increasing number of breakpoints over the sample, we estimated kernel density of the persistence measure. The results confirmed the relationship between persistence and the number of breakpoints. It also showed that the use of <b>break</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms leads to lower persistence estimates, even within the class of models with an equal number of breaks. Therefore, the overall decrease in persistence can be attributed both to the number of breaks and their position, as suggested by the chosen <b>break</b> <b>detection</b> tests. ...|$|E

In order to perform reliable and detailed analysis of extreme temperature events it is important to use long daily, high quality and homogenized temperature series (3). The Mediterranean region is considered as a „Hot Spot “ of climate change which will suffer from even more severe and frequent heat waves in the future (4). However, most climate studies are based on non-homogenized data that are not necessarily appropriate for cli-mate analysis and could also lead to inaccurate or even wrong results. To address this problem we (i) developed and applied a new homogenization technique to daily temperature series in the eas-tern Mediterranean, (ii) proposed a new heat wave definition and (iii) estimated changes in heat waves number, length and intensity. Three independent <b>break</b> <b>detection</b> methods (5 - 7) to detect an unknown number of break points (BPs) are used in combination with a non linear model (8) to correct daily summer (JJAS) maximum (TX) and mini-mum temperature (TN) series of 246 stations across the eastern Mediterranean covering the period 1960 - 2006.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the modeling of nonlinear wave transformation by means of weakly nonlinear Boussinesq models. We show that for a given linear dispersion relation and linear shoaling parameter one can derive, within the same asymptotic truncation, two system of PDEs differing only {{in the form of}} the linear dispersive operators. In particular, these can either be formulated in terms of derivatives of the velocity, or in terms of derivatives of the flux. In the first case we speak of amplitude-velocity form of the model, in the second case of amplitude flux form. We show examples of these couples for several linear relations, including a new amplitude-flux variant of the model of Nwogu. We then show, both analytically and by numerical nonlinear shoaling tests, that while for small amplitude waves it is important to have accurate linear dispersion and shoaling characteristics, when approaching breaking conditions it is only the amplitude-velocity or amplitude-flux form of the equations which determines the behavior of the model, and in particular the shape and the height of the waves.
