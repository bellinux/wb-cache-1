5|$|Migratory populations {{leave their}} <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> in September and October, {{returning}} from March onwards, {{although in the}} far north they may not arrive before May.|$|E
5|$|The male, {{which plays}} {{no part in}} nesting or chick care, leaves the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> in late June or early July, {{followed}} later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. Male ruffs may {{also be able to}} tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds,</b> and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
2500|$|The emperor {{penguins}} use {{a particular}} spot as their <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> {{because it is}} on ice that is solid year round and no danger of the ice becoming too soft to support the colony exists. At the end of Antarctic summer, the <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> {{is only a few}} hundred meters away from the open water where the penguins can feed. However, by the end of winter, the <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> is over [...] away from the nearest open water. To reach it, all the penguins of breeding age must traverse this great distance.|$|R

5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds,</b> although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b> Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
5|$|Since November 2015, whales {{gather around}} Hachijō-jima, far north from the known {{breeding}} {{areas in the}} Bonin Islands. All breeding activities except for giving births had been confirmed as of January, 2016. That makes Hachijo-jima the northernmost breeding ground in the world, north of <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> such as Amami Ōshima, Midway Island, and Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Stable {{isotopes}} of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur {{can establish}} avian migratory connectivity between wintering sites and <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b> Stable isotopic methods to establish migratory linkage rely on spatial isotopic differences in bird diet that {{are incorporated into}} inert tissues like feathers, or into growing tissues such as claws and muscle or blood.|$|E

50|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>Ground</b> {{were created}} in 1981 by vocalist Shirreff, guitarist Gladish, and bassist Strayer. <b>Breeding</b> <b>Ground</b> played over 40 shows on the Queen Street West circuit before they {{released}} their first eponymous debut EP, <b>Breeding</b> <b>Ground,</b> on Mannequin Records, recorded at Montclair Sound in November 1982, with original drummer Ken Jones. This was produced by Paul Tozer, their live audio technician, who worked with them on their first two EPs. Within a month of its release {{they were asked to}} open up for Bauhaus on December 4, 1982 at Larry's Hideaway in Toronto. Comparisons to Joy Division and the British cold-wave invasion were quick to surface after this release. They were managed by longtime friend David Hart (who also masterminded and operated the stage lighting) during this era. <b>Breeding</b> <b>Ground</b> also played at Lee's Palace in Toronto in 1986.|$|R

5|$|The {{coasts of}} the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Barents Sea are {{important}} <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> for bearded seals and ringed seals. Gray seals are rare and endemic to the Barents Sea. Greenland seals, or harp seals, {{also can be}} seen from time to time.|$|E
5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} estuaries of Hilton Head Island are {{the feeding}} grounds, <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds,</b> and nurseries for many saltwater species of game fish, sport fish, and marine mammals. The dense plankton population gives the coastal water its murky brown-green coloration.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds,</b> with distinctive threat displays, but {{are more}} gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate. This common and conspicuous species {{has given rise to}} a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.|$|E

5|$|The African river {{martin has}} a {{restricted}} distribution; {{it appears to}} be locally numerous, although its true status has not been fully investigated. The white-eyed river martin was discovered as recently as 1969 and is only known from specimens and anecdotal evidence – no modern ornithologists have seen the species in the wild, and its <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> are unknown. It may be extinct, although a possible sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E

5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of roads are present near it. The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads. The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools may be used as <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> for mosquitos.|$|E

Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are common at the gorge's upper end. However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more common {{at the lower end}} of the gorge. There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States {{have moved}} into the contiguous United States from the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. The highest rainfall totals in {{the country have been}} measured across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E
