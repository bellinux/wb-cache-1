5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5grams per day, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> in the United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E

Over 40% {{of the population of}} Van left the city to go work on the farms. The Armenian government started a weapons and ammunition industry, and most of the formerly Russian mines were scrapped and used for building projects in Van. The Armenian government tried to impose taxes, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> ignored the tax collectors.|$|E
25|$|In the generational {{transmission}} of surnames, the paternal surname's precedence eventually eliminates the maternal surnames {{from the family}} lineage. Contemporary law allows the maternal surname to be given precedence, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> observe the traditional paternal–maternal surname order. So the daughter and son of Ángela López Sáenz and Tomás Portillo Blanco are usually called Laura Portillo López and Pedro Portillo López, but also could be called Laura López Portillo and Pedro López Portillo. The two surnames of all of a couple's children {{must be in the}} same order when recorded in the Registro Civil.|$|E

An Executor can apply to a local probate registry for a grant themselves <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> use a probate practitioner such as a solicitor. If an estate is small, some banks and building societies allow the deceased's immediate family to close accounts without a grant, but there usually must be less than about £15,000 in the account for this to be permitted.|$|E

25|$|Acetic acid is a two-carbon {{organic acid}} {{produced}} in wine {{during or after}} the fermentation period. It is the most volatile of the primary acids associated with wine and {{is responsible for the}} sour taste of vinegar. During fermentation, activity by yeast cells naturally produces a small amount of acetic acid. If the wine is exposed to oxygen, Acetobacter bacteria will convert the ethanol into acetic acid. This process is known as the “acetification” of wine and is the primary process behind wine degradation into vinegar. An excessive amount of acetic acid is also considered a wine fault. A taster's sensitivity to acetic acid will vary, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> can detect excessive amounts at around 600mg/l.|$|E
25|$|For some inhabitants, Flanders is {{more than}} just a {{geographical}} area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement even call it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even very proud, while some 25% are not proud and 8% is very not proud. Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them staying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in services, the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers - both housewives and house husbands.|$|E

500|$|Herbert Aptheker stated {{already in}} 1939, in [...] "Maroons Within the Present Limits of the United States", that likely [...] "about two {{thousand}} Negroes, fugitives, or {{the descendants of}} fugitives" [...] lived in the Great Dismal Swamp, trading with white people outside the swamp. Results of {{a study published in}} 2007, [...] "The Political Economy of Exile in the Great Dismal Swamp", say that thousands of people lived in the swamp between 1630 and 1865, Native Americans, maroons and enslaved laborers on the canal. A 2011 study speculated that thousands may have lived in the swamp between the 1600s and 1860. While the precise number of maroons who lived in the swamp at that time is unknown, it {{is believed to have been}} one of the largest maroon colonies in the United States. It is established that [...] "several thousand" [...] were living there by the 19th century. However, fear of slave unrest and fugitive slaves living among maroon population caused concern amongst local whites. A militia with dogs went into the swamp in 1823 in an attempt to remove the maroons and destroy their community, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> escaped. In 1847, North Carolina passed a law specifically aimed at apprehending the maroons in the swamp. However, unlike other maroon communities, where local militias often captured the residents and destroyed their homes, those in the Great Dismal Swamp mostly avoided capture or the discovery of their homes.|$|E

500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from {{the dishes and}} place it on trenchers of stale bread, wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E

[...] Third is [...] "Comin’ in Hot", a party song and the album's fourth single that uses humor to describe what happens in night clubs. [...] "My Town" [...] is the fifth single and a mid-tempo song talking about Los Angeles and Hollywood. Next is [...] "I Don't Wanna Die", a song about the fear of death fueling the need to kill another person. [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the lead single from the album and is about the troubles each band member was going through at the time the song was written. The song's lyrics tell the story of a person who is depressed and hopeless, taking a very somber tone to the track. Despite this, the instruments and melodies contrast to make an uptempo track. Next is [...] "Gangsta Sexy", a party anthem song about heading to nightclubs and pursuing women. The following track, [...] "Glory", is a metal-inspired song which drew influence from war and fighting. [...] "Lights Out", the ninth song on the album, is about Deuce, ex-vocalist of Hollywood Undead. It is a response to [...] "Story of a Snitch". [...] "Coming Back Down", the third single released from the album, is a rock ballad song with acoustic guitars on the track. The lyrics describes about a story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. [...] "Bullet", the eleventh track from the album, is an uptempo pop song about suicide. It is played in an upbeat tempo with energetic vocals, which gives contrast to the dark lyrical content. Rick Florino called the track, [...] "heart-wrenching genius". [...] "Levitate" [...] is an uptempo discothèque song about sex, while the verses of the song talk about suicide and alcoholism.
