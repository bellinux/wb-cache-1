The current study provides {{one of the}} first genome wide analyses of the downstream gene <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> for SRY and SOX 9 to help elucidate the molecular control of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development. A modified ChIP-Chip analysis using a comparative hybridization was used to identify 71 direct downstream <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> for SRY and 109 <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> for SOX 9. Interestingly, only 5 gene targets overlapped between SRY and SOX 9. In addition to the direct response element <b>binding</b> gene <b>targets,</b> a large number of atypical <b>binding</b> gene <b>targets</b> were identified for both SRY and SOX 9. Bioinformatic analysis of the downstream <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> identified gene networks and cellular pathways potentially involved in the induction of Sertoli cell differentiation and testis development. The specific DNA sequence binding site motifs for both SRY and SOX 9 were identified. Observations provide insights into the molecular control of male gonadal sex determination...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I study the e¤ects of {{environmental}} regulation which establishes {{upper and lower}} <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> to pollution emissions. Essentially, I deal with the properties of a stochastic model of pollution control in continuous-time under emission targets and uncertainty, emphasizing dynamic nonlinearities. Inside the targets pollution behaves {{as if it were}} freely floating until it hits one of the two limits. The model provides three main results. First, I show that <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> can affect the pollution floating even when the boundaries are currently slack. Solutions of the model show that pollution becomes an S-shaped locus of the fundamentals. Second, I show that <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> will lead to more stable pollution rate determination within the boundaries, than free floating. Finally, stabilization of pollution is related to the growth rate and volatility of fundamentals, to the sensitivity to expected changes of pollution rate and to the credibility of the authorities in defending the pollution targets.

40|$|ABSTRACT Calmodulin (CaM) {{signaling}} involves important, wide spread eukaryotic protein– protein interactions. The solved {{structures of}} CaM associated {{with several of}} its <b>binding</b> <b>targets,</b> the distinctive <b>binding</b> mechanism of CaM, and the significant trypsin sensitivity of the <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> combine {{to indicate that the}} process of association likely involves coupled binding and folding for both CaM and its <b>binding</b> <b>targets.</b> Here, we use bioinformatics approaches to test the hypothesis that CaMbinding targets are intrinsically disordered. We developed a predictor of CaM-binding regions and estimated its performance. Per residue accuracy of this predictor reached 81 %, which, in combination with a high recall/precision balance at the binding region level, suggests high predictability of CaMbinding partners. An analysis of putative CaMbinding proteins in yeast and human strongly indicates that their molecular functions are related to those of intrinsically disordered proteins. These findings add to the growing list of examples in which intrinsically disordered protein regions are indicated to provide the basis for cell signaling and regulation.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to hepatocellular carcinoma, several research {{studies have indicated}} that loss of ADAR1 contributes to melanoma growth and metastasis. It is known that ADAR can act on microRNA and affect it’s biogenesis, stability and/or it’s <b>binding</b> <b>target.</b> It has been suggested that ADAR1 is downregulated by cAMP- response element binding protein (CREB), limiting its ability to act on miRNA. One such example is miR-455-5p which is edited by ADAR1. When ADAR is downregulated by CREB the unedited miR-455-5p downregulates a tumor suppressor protein called CPEB1, contributing to melanoma progression in an in vivo model.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} no unequivocal {{demonstration}} that the activator <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> identified in vitro {{play a key role}} in transcriptional activation in vivo. To examine whether activator-Mediator interactions are required for gene transcription under physiological conditions, we performed functional analyses with Mediator components that interact specifically with natural yeast activators. Different activators interact with Mediator via distinct <b>binding</b> <b>targets.</b> Deletion of a distinct activator binding region of Mediator completely compromised gene activation in vivo by some, but not all, transcriptional activators. These demonstrate that the activator-specific targets in Mediator are essential for transcriptional activation in living cells, but their requirement was affected by the nature of the activator-DNA interaction and the existence of a postrecruitment activation process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background ChIP-chip {{data are}} {{routinely}} {{used to identify}} transcription factor <b>binding</b> <b>targets.</b> However, the presence of false positives and false negatives in ChIP-chip data complicates and hinders analyses, especially when the <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> for a specific transcription factor are compared across conditions or species. Results We propose an Expectation Maximization based approach to infer the underlying true counts of "positives" and "negatives" from the observed counts. Based on this approach, we study the effect of false positives and false negatives on inferences related to transcription regulation. Conclusion Our results indicate {{that if there is}} a significant degree of association among the <b>binding</b> <b>targets</b> across conditions/species (log odds ratio > 4), moderate values of false positive and false negative rates (0. 005 and 0. 4 respectively) would not change our inference qualitatively (i. e. the presence or absence of conservation) based on the observed experimental data despite a significant change in the observed counts. However, if the underlying association is marginal, with odds ratios close to 1, moderate to large values of false positive and false negative rates (0. 01 and 0. 2 respectively) could mask the underlying association. </p...|$|R

Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, {{which in turn}} changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the crystal}} {{structure}} changed surprisingly little after binding to cilengitide, the current {{hypothesis is that}} integrin function involves changes in shape to move the ligand-binding site into a more accessible position, away from the cell surface, and this shape change also triggers intracellular signaling.
