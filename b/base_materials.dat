5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the <b>base</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the <b>base</b> <b>materials.</b> It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E

The method includes {{providing a}} substrate comprising a surface region and forming an insulating material overlying the surface region. The method also includes forming {{a film of}} carbon <b>based</b> <b>material</b> overlying the insulating material and treating to the film of carbon <b>based</b> <b>material</b> to pyrolyzed the carbon <b>based</b> <b>material</b> to cause formation of a film of substantially carbon <b>based</b> <b>material</b> having a resistivity ranging within a predetermined range. The method also provides at least {{a portion of the}} pyrolyzed carbon <b>based</b> <b>material</b> in a sensor application and uses the portion of the pyrolyzed carbon <b>based</b> <b>material</b> in the sensing application.

50|$|In many areas, caliche is {{also used}} for road construction, either as a {{surfacing}} material or, more commonly, as <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> It {{is one of the}} most common road materials used in Southern Africa. Caliche is widely used as a <b>base</b> <b>material</b> when it is locally available and cheap. However it does not hold up to moisture (rain), and is never used if a hard rock <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> such as limestone, is available.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or <b>base</b> <b>materials.</b> Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

40|$|Si-SiC matrix C/C {{composites}} {{are known}} to be synthesized through the following process. With the C/C composite having a yarn-like structure of carbon fibers as a <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> the Si-SiC matrix C/C composite is obtained by synthesizing a trunk Si-SiC matrix after impregnating Si into the clearances between yarns and then synthesizing a branch Si-SiC matrix which stretches from the trunk Si-SiC {{to the inside of the}} C/C composite. Compressive strength of the Si-SiC matrix C/C composite is increased up to about twice as large as that of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite. However, the tensile strength of this composite is decreased to about one fourth of that of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite, and the bending strength is decreased to about a half of that of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite. This paper reports that 1) degradation of tensile/bending strength caused on the Si-SiC matrix C/C composite is an unavoidable phenomenon and 2) a technique for forming only a part of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite into the Si-SiC matrix structure is an effective means of structural component design by increasing compressive strength of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite and restraining degradation of tensile/bending strength. </p...|$|R

500|$|Welding {{dissimilar}} metals often introduces new difficulties to GTAW welding, {{because most}} materials do not easily fuse {{to form a}} strong bond. However, welds of dissimilar materials have numerous applications in manufacturing, repair work, and the prevention of corrosion and oxidation. In some joints, a compatible filler metal is chosen to help form the bond, and this filler metal can {{be the same as}} one of the <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> (for example, using a stainless steel filler metal with stainless steel and carbon steel as <b>base</b> <b>materials),</b> or a different metal (such as the use of a nickel filler metal for joining steel and cast iron). Very different materials may be coated or [...] "buttered" [...] with a material compatible with a particular filler metal, and then welded. In addition, GTAW can be used in cladding or overlaying dissimilar materials.|$|E

2500|$|The wide {{diffusion}} of Olmec artifacts and [...] "Olmecoid" [...] iconography {{throughout much of}} Mesoamerica indicates the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. Exotic, prestigious and high-value materials such as greenstone and marine shell were moved in significant quantities across large distances. Some {{of the reasons for}} trade revolve around the lack of obsidian in the heartland. The Olmec used obsidian in many tools because worked edges were very sharp and durable. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala showing the extensive trade. [...] While the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, the Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, more variety in material goods exchanged and a greater diversity in the sources from which the <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> were obtained.|$|E
2500|$|Base: The {{bottom of}} the board that is {{in contact with the}} snow surface. It is {{generally}} made of a porous, plastic (polyethylene) material, that is saturated with a wax to create a very quick and smooth, hydrophobic surface. P-Tex is a brand name that has become synonymous with base material. It is important that the base be [...] "slippery", with respect to the snow surface and board interaction. Bases are made to have amorphous areas that are porous to wax. Wax is an important finishing product for all <b>base</b> <b>materials.</b> Not only does it allow the snowboard to have a smoother glide, but it also allows the rider to change the characteristics of the base and adjust the board to the snow conditions. Different base waxes are available for different temperatures. The base, when maintained, will have a designed base structure that not only channels snow, air and water, but leaves it open enough for wax to penetrate deep inside it. This pattern is created with a stonegrind machine at the factory or a local ski shop. If the base is damaged, it is common to have it repaired {{in order to protect the}} core from exposure as well as reducing friction.|$|E
