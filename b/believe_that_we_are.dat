25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E
500|$|On 3 February 1944, the LCS {{proposed}} a plan [...] "to induce the enemy to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> enlisting {{the help of}} Sweden {{in connection with the}} British and Russian contemplated operations against northern Norway in the Spring of this year." [...] The department received approval to move forward with Graffham on 10 February 1944. It would be an entirely British operation with no American involvement (in contrast to the other Bodyguard components). Based on recommendations from the Chiefs of Staff, the LCS outlined seven requests to present to the Swedish government: ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2000s, Blancornelas {{wanted to}} remove bylines from Zetas most {{dangerous}} stories, but was persuaded not to by reporter Francisco Ortiz, who wished his {{to continue to}} run atop his stories on organized crime. In 2005, Ortiz {{was shot to death}} in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, [...] "I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. I would have liked to retire a long time ago ... I cannot allow drug traffickers to think {{that they were able to}} crush Zeta's spirit, and our readers to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> afraid." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gordon {{decided to}} stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone {{government}} to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers who acted as Gordon's unofficial press attach√© wrote in The Times: [...] "We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to be abandoned". In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. I know if I was chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E
2500|$|Three days later, in {{response}} to the prediction of the [...] "increasing Asianisation" [...] of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister Stewart West, Blainey argued: [...] "I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better".|$|E

2500|$|... "When the Six Day War ended, {{everyone}} {{thought that the}} 'mother of all wars' was over and we won. I was terrified and thought to myself, 'What would happen to our prisoners there if this story gets out?' Nevertheless, I feel that we must not be silent.... People say that these things happen in wartime {{and that there is}} loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these skeletons out of the closet, even if we think that the enemy has more skeletons than us. We must not be silent. We are all part of this terrible conspiracy of silence, and it is eating us up inside." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett's reply {{from natural}} selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, {{a human being}} is born {{that does not have}} Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] but {{nevertheless}} acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a [...] "zombie" [...] in thought experiments in the philosophy of mind). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually [...] "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|E
2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There are some that {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ... I hope there are few men in the parliament who <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> proud of what the Empire has done, and our contribution must be adequate, and in every way worthy of that effort ... To [...] now would be a national sin, a national calamity. As opposition leader, Cook had opposed almost no government measures throughout 1916, and Hughes and his faction were becoming increasingly distant from the bulk of the ALP and aligning much more with the conservative opposition. When the second reading of the Military Service Referendum bill was moved, it carried 46 to 10 in the House and 19 to 9 in the Senate. In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority. Hughes stared down his enemies within the party and committed himself fully to the campaign: [...] "For myself, I say that I am going into this referendum campaign as if it were the only thing for which I lived." ...|$|E
