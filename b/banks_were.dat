5|$|On 29 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Glitnir would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed. On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, {{more than half a million}} depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank credit {{facilities}} to Icelandic <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were {{to be put to}} the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, {{most people}} were already {{residing}} at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year. Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> also closed. Officials also ordered for cars to be off the roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.|$|E
5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E

5|$|The global {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s affected Ireland less because of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. <b>Banks</b> <b>were</b> reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts.|$|E
5|$|Wholesale funding {{disappeared}} in September 2008 {{leading to the}} collapse of Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki. Due {{to the size of the}} combined balance sheet of those banks the government of Iceland did not have the means to save those banks. They were put into receivership instead with their boards replaced. Nevertheless, the failed <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> restructured by dividing them into a new and an old bank in order to avoid a credit crunch.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> badly damaged.

5|$|In 2001, <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This set {{the stage}} for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
5|$|The River Slea {{rises to}} the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E

5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Federal Reserve Act in 1913, {{giving rise to}} the Federal Reserve System. Its {{inception}} drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system's design also considered {{the findings of the}} Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's <b>banks</b> <b>were</b> liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market.|$|E
