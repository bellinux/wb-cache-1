Then the background staining was blocked by incubation with blocking buffer (0.1  % Triton X- 100, 3  % BSA and 2  % normal donkey serum) for 1  h. These experiments were carried out using the following first antibodies: anti-Salmonella (Abcam), anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD 105 (BD PharMingen) and anti-Ki 67 (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with PBS, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied. Finally, the sections were stained with a freshly prepared 3, 3 ′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen using a DAB kit (DAKO) and then counterstained with hematoxylin.

It is anticipated that: (i) chronic imaging enabled by this minimally invasive procedure will advance the study of cortical plasticity and neurological diseases; (ii) revealing the neuroactivity-dependent changes in hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation will facilitate the understanding of neurovascular coupling at the capillary level; and (iii) combining functional OR-PAM and high-resolution blood flowmetry will have the potential to explore cellular pathways of brain energy metabolism...|$|R
40|$|A 94 -layer long-period mica polytype was {{studied by}} {{transmission}} electron microscopy (TEM). This is the longest periodicity found up to now in micas (c ≈ 95. 9 nm). It was observed in a fragment of a Mg-rich annite (biotite) crystal from dacite rocks of Džep, Serbia. The crystal region containing it extends about 800 nm along 1 /c*. One-dimensional lattice fringe images obtained by <b>bright-field</b> (BF) <b>illumination</b> allowed identification of the very long-period polytype. The latter was characterized by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM). It is an inhomogeneous polytype belonging to the subfamily-A, based on the 2 M 1 structural series. Its 94 -layer stacking sequence has been determined. The fringe contrasts of the BF images were correlated to the stacking sequence determined from HR images. The correlation verified that the same sequence occurred eight consecutive times. Analytical electron microscopy (AEM) revealed that the chemical composition of the 94 -layer mica polytype {{is similar to that}} previously observed in randomly stacked and faulted areas of the same crystal.

In this investigation, a {{measurement}} {{system based on}} machine vision applied for auto-hub's eccentricity between the center hole and the pitch circle of bolt holes was proposed. The measurement system was integrated by a CCD camera with a telecentric lens, a diffuse <b>bright-field</b> back light <b>illumination</b> system, a rotating platform, a rotating encoder and an industrial computer. The camera was fixed at a suitable location from the rotation center, which ensured that one bolt hole {{and a part of}} the center hole could appear in its visual field. All bolt holes were shot when the auto-hub was rotating, while a rotary encoder recorded these angles. Then a global image of the auto-hub could be tiled by these pictures. An image-processing algorithm integrating morphology, circle fitting, affine transformation and edge extracting was used to measure the auto-hub's eccentricity. According to the measurement of a standard block that had 50 um-eccentricity and was manufactured by WEDM-LS (Wire Cut Electrical Discharge Machining-Low Speed), the maximum deviation between measuring value and real value was less than 0. 013 mm, eccentricity's standard deviation was 0. 0035 mm and the standard deviation of eccentricity's direction angle was 2. 37 °. Meanwhile the experimental data of real auto-hubs gave an eccentricity's standard deviation less than 0. 013 mm and a direction angle's standard deviation less than 2. 1 °. ? 2013 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{integration of}} optogenetic illumination of C. elegans neural circuits and muscular force measurement in a structured microfluidic chip mimicking the C. elegans soil habitat. The integrated system deploys two optical pathways in an inverted microscope. One is for <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> {{to extract the}} worm body contour for real-time closed-loop tracking, the other is for optogenetic illumination to project structured light patterns with specific wavelength onto the worm body segments of interest. The behaviors of a freely moving worm in the chip under optogenetic manipulation can be recorded for off-line analysis which mainly collects the contact force between the worm body muscle and its surrounding environment. This enabling platform allows stimulating or inhibiting worm neurons and simultaneously measuring its thrust force, which offers a new insight into the correlation between neurons and locomotion behaviors of the nematode. Using wild-type C. elegans, we demonstrated the capability and potential of the system, and found {{no significant difference in}} thrust forces of wild-type worm under optogenetic illumination or not...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{translocation}} of an actively transcribing RNA polymerase leads to local increases or decreases in DNA torsion (twin-supercoiled domain), which cannot be resolved in vivo due to interactions of the template DNA, nascent RNA and polymerase with the crowded cellular environment. Local changes in DNA supercoiling are biologically relevant as they have been shown to regulate transcription initiation at promoters located downstream. Current in vitro single-molecule approaches are not able to directly probe transcription-coupled DNA supercoiling due to an inability to simultaneously monitor changes in torsional stress and localise individual transcribing RNA polymerase(s) on the DNA. Described here is a novel optical microscope, which utilises a combination of magnetic tweezers, <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> and wide-field epifluorescence imaging to permit the visualisation of fluorescently tagged polymerases transcribing in real-time on a torsionally constrained DNA template. With this unique geometry, transcription as a function of applied torsion can be probed directly in vitro. Unlike standard magnetic tweezers configurations this system extends tethers horizontally relative to the microscope slide surface, which allows individual enzymes to be directly viewed via attached fluorophores. The magnetic tweezers allow both the relative extension and linking number of the DNA tether to be manipulated, thus enabling transcription to be studied under conditions of constant DNA extension and defined torsional stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{completeness}} of tumor removal {{during surgery}} {{is dependent on}} the surgeon’s ability to differentiate tumor from normal tissue using subjective criteria that are not easily quantifiable. A way to objectively assess tumor margins during surgery in patients would be of great value. We have developed a method to visualize tumors during surgery using activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs), in which the fluorescently labeled, polycationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is coupled via a cleavable linker to a neutralizing peptide. Upon exposure to proteases characteristic of tumor tissue, the linker is cleaved, dissociating the inhibitory peptide and allowing the CPP to bind to and enter tumor cells. In mice, xenografts stably transfected with green fluorescent protein show colocalization with the Cy 5 -labeled ACPPs. In the same mouse models, Cy 5 -labeled free ACPPs and ACPPs conjugated to dendrimers (ACPPDs) delineate the margin between tumor and adjacent tissue, resulting in improved precision of tumor resection. Surgery guided by ACPPD resulted in fewer residual cancer cells left in the animal after surgery as measured by Alu PCR. A single injection of ACPPD dually labeled with Cy 5 and gadolinium chelates enabled preoperative whole-body tumor detection by MRI, intraoperative guidance by real-time fluorescence, intraoperative histological analysis of margin status by fluorescence, and postoperative MRI tumor quantification. Animals whose tumors were resected with ACPPD guidance had better long-term tumor-free survival and overall survival than animals whose tumors were resected with traditional <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> only...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} response to orthodontic tooth movement has generally focused on reactions within the periodontal ligament (PDL), whereas less {{attention has been}} paid to the behavior of neighboring bone. The purpose of the study was to describe the influence of orthodontic force on bone surrounding the displaced tooth and the adjacent, untreated teeth, Bone changes in relation to treatment time and different sites were investigated. A mesial tipping of the left maxillary first molar was obtained from 54 adult male Wistar rats. Oxytetracycline was injected subcutaneously 48 h before killing, which took place after 4, 7, or 14 days. The maxilla was fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate, A set of thick horizontal sections was taken from the cervical, intermediate, and apical levels of the roots. The sections were microadiographed and analyzed microscopically under <b>bright-field</b> and fluorescent <b>illumination.</b> Bone fraction and PDL width was measured using a Zeiss Videoplan device equipped with an overlay system. New bone formation was detected by oxytetracycline labels. The analysis showed a consistent, significant decrease of the alveolar bone fraction around both displaced and adjacent teeth at ail treatment times, Apposition, indicated by the tetracycline uptake, was found on the periosteal side of the treated hemimaxilla and, after 14 days, also on the surface toward which the tooth was moving and around the adjacent teeth. These results suggest that a time rather than a space relationship exists between bone resorption and formation and that the whole hemimaxilla reacts to the mechanical challenge, resembling the regional acceleratory phenomenon (RAP) observed in other circumstances.

40|$|Charged {{particle}} {{therapy is}} increasingly becoming {{a valuable tool}} in cancer treatment, mainly due to the favorable interaction of particle radiation with matter. Its application is still limited due, in part, to lack of data regarding the radiosensitivity of certain cell lines to this radiation type, especially to high-LET particles. From {{the earliest days of}} radiation biology, the clonogenic survival assay has been used to provide radiation response data. This method produces reliable data but it is not optimized for high-throughput microbeam studies with high-LET radiation where high levels of cell killing lead to a very low probability of maintaining cells’ clonogenic potential. A new method, therefore, is proposed in this paper, which could potentially allow these experiments to be conducted in a high-throughput fashion. Cells are seeded in special polypropylene dishes and <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> provides cell visualization. Digital images are obtained and cell detection is applied based on corner detection, generating individual cell targets as x-y points. These points in the dish are then irradiated individually by a micron field size high-LET microbeam. Post-irradiation, time-lapse imaging follows cells’ response. All irradiated cells are tracked by linking trajectories in all time-frames, based on finding their nearest position. Cell divisions are detected based on cell appearance and individual cell temporary corner density. The number of divisions anticipated is low due to the high probability of cell killing from high-LET irradiation. Survival curves are produced based on cell’s capacity to divide at least 4 - 5 times. The process is repeated for a range of doses of radiation. Validation shows the efficiency of the proposed cell detection and tracking method in finding cell divisions...|$|E
40|$|Optogenetics {{has been}} {{recently}} applied {{to manipulate the}} neural circuits of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to investigate its mechanosensation and locomotive behavior, which is a fundamental topic in model biology. In most neuron-related research, free C. elegans moves on an open area such as agar surface. However, this simple environment {{is different from the}} soil, in which C. elegans naturally dwells. To bridge up the gap, this paper presents integration of optogenetic illumination of C. elegans neural circuits and muscular force measurement in a structured microfluidic chip mimicking the C. elegans soil habitat. The microfluidic chip is essentially a ∼ 1 x 1 cm 2 elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane micro-pillar array, configured in either form of lattice (LC) or honeycomb (HC) to mimic the environment in which the worm dwells. The integrated system has four key modules for illumination pattern generation, pattern projection, automatic tracking of the worm, and force measurement. Specifically, two optical pathways co-exist in an inverted microscope, including built-in <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> for worm tracking and pattern generation, and added-in optogenetic illumination for pattern projection onto the worm body segment. The behavior of a freely moving worm in the chip under optogenetic manipulation can be recorded for off-line force measurements. Using wild-type N 2 C. elegans, we demonstrated optical illumination of C. elegans neurons by projecting light onto its head/tail segment at 14 Hz refresh frequency. We also measured the force and observed three representative locomotion patterns of forward movement, reversal, and omega turn for LC and HC configurations. Being capable of stimulating or inhibiting worm neurons and simultaneously measuring the thrust force, this enabling platform would offer new insights into the correlation between neurons and locomotive behaviors of the nematode under a complex environment...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescent {{microscopy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tools in the life-sciences. The ability to tag molecules of interest and then localise their positions within two or even three dimensions provides a great deal of information about the underlying chemical and biological processes. However, many microscope are high cost, with expensive imaging optics and lasers illumination systems. We report on the development of the a novel low cost microscope designed for fluorescent imaging of tagged markers within live cells. The microscope is designed using low cost components and aims to give diffraction limited imaging. One of the major costs in a microscope its the optics, especially the objective lens that must provide a flat diffraction limited image. There have been a number of low cost microscopes developed in recent years that completely remove the objective and either directly cast a shadow of the object directly onto the CCD sensor or uses some diffractive process. However, these tend to be <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> microscopes. Lensless fluorescent microscopes are more difficult since a bandpass filter must be incorporated into the system. The physical size of the filter means the object will be too far away from the CCD sensor to achieve a good image. To overcome this we place a one to one imaging lens within the optical path, which then allows room for the filter. Since one to one lenses are symmetric, the aberrations tend balance out meaning they can provide good image quality with a simple low cost design. However, to achieve sub-micron resolution we introduce a pinhole array into the system which, by scanning can be shown to provide super-resolution images. The excitation illumination is provided by a high powered LED and the system imaged onto a standard CCD camera...|$|E
40|$|Confocal {{microscopy}} rejects out {{of focus}} light from the object by scanning a pinhole through the object and constructing the image point by point. Volume holographic imaging (VHI) systems with <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination</b> have been proposed {{as an alternative to}} conventional confocal type microscopes. VHI systems are an imaging modality that does not require scanning of a pinhole or a slit and thus provides video rate imaging of 3 -dimensional objects. However, due to the wavelength-position degeneracy of the hologram, these systems produce less than optimal optical sectioning because the high selectivity of the volume hologram is not utilized. In this dissertation a generalized method for the design of VHI systems applied to microscopy is developed. Discussion includes the inter-relationships between the dispersive, degenerate, and depth axes of the system. Novel designs to remove the wavelength-position degeneracy and improve optical sectioning in these systems are also considered. Optimization of a fluorescence imaging system and of dual-grating confocal-rainbow designs are investigated. A ray-trace simulation that integrates the hologram diffraction efficiency and imaging results is constructed and an experimental system evaluated to demonstrate the optimization method. This results in an empirical relation between depth resolution and design tolerances. The dispersion and construction tolerances of a confocal-rainbow volume holographic imaging system are defined by the Bragg selectivity of the holograms. It is found that a broad diffraction efficiency profile of the illumination hologram with a narrow imaging hologram profile is an optimal balance between field of view, construction alignment, and depth resolution. The approach in this research is directly applicable towards imaging ovarian cells for the detection of cancer. Modeling methods, illumination design, eliminating the wavelength degeneracy of the hologram, and incorporating florescence imaging capability are emphasized in this dissertation. Results from this research may be used not only for biomedical imaging, but also for the design of volume holographic systems for both imaging and sensor applications in other fields including manufacturing (e. g. pharmaceutical), aerospace (e. g. LIDAR), and the physical sciences (e. g. climate change) ...|$|E

Chapter 1 describes the background and the outline of this study. For preliminaries, thestate-of-art and future semiconductor manufacturing technologies are introduced referring toInternational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), and the process of semiconductormanufacturing and lithography technologies are reviewed. Chapter 2 also serves as preliminaries to provide knowledge relevant to the subjects of thedissertation. Explanations are given on a semiconductor exposure tool called as a stepper or ascanner, wafer measurement systems, a focus measurement system, an alignment measurementsystem, and the sequence of semiconductor exposure. Finally, to clarify the issues to be discussed,error factors of alignment measurement system are identified and categorized. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 constitute {{the main part of the}} dissertation, and describe the mostimportant outcome of this thesis work. In Chapter 3, error analysis is given to the alignmentmeasurement system of a semiconductor exposure tool. First, an overlay error budget is discussed andthe required accuracy of overlay is quantified. Then, error analysis is given to Tool Induced Shift（TIS）and Wafer Induced Shift（WIS）, and the importance of TIS-WIS interaction is clarified. Asimple physical model is proposed that can explain the behavior of TIS, and the results ofexperiments and simulations are presented that demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. InChapter 4, new improvement methods are proposed that can solve not only the TIS problem but alsothe WIS problem. As a solution to the TIS problem, a new criterion is proposed to quantify bothcomatic aberrations and the deviation from illumination telecentricity in alignment optics. To solvethe WIS problem, asymmetry of an alignment mark is quantified, and offset control for the alignmentmeasurement system of semiconductor exposure tool is determined by using an atomic forcemicroscope and an optical simulator. This method is referred to as Alignment Offset Analyzer. Finally Chapter 5 gives the summary and the conclusions of the dissertation. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{segmental}} {{levels of}} afferent fibers from the pinna receptive field of scratch reflex {{have been investigated}} by the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method in cats. HRP solution (20 - 40 %, 2 - 40 mg) was injected into the localized areas of the pinna receptive field in 26 cases. Cats were allowed to survive for about 3 days. After fixation, frozen sections (60 μm thick) of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from C 1 to C 5 segmental levels were cut and each section reacted histo-chemically with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). HRP labeled cells in DRGs from C 1 to C 5 levels were counted under the light microscope using a <b>bright-field</b> <b>illumination.</b> The results are summarized as follows. 1) In either case in which HRP was injected into bursella or scapha margin of the pinna receptive field, labeled cells were observed invariably in the DRGs from C 1 to C 3 levels. In several cases, labeled cells were found also in C 4 DRG. No labeled cells were found in C 5 DRG. Labeled cells were most numerous in C 2 DRG of which {{the mean number of}} labeled cells in each section was over 60. The number of labeled cells was higher in the order of C 2, C 3 and C 1 DRGs. 2) In order to reveal the quantitative difference in the segmental levels of the afferents from various parts of the pinna receptive field, the pinna was subdivided into several localized areas (tip, anterior and posterior part of the scapha margin, bursella, concha). In the cases of HRP injection into the scapha margin (14 cases), the number of labeled cells of C 2 DRG (mean: 79 /section) was significantly higher than those of C 3 DRG (mean: 12 /section) and C 1 DRG (mean: 6 /section). But in the cases of HRP injection into bursella (12 cases), {{there were no significant differences}} between the numbers of labeled cells of C 2 (mean: 71 /section) and C 3 DRG (mean: 48 /section). The number of labeled cells of C 1 DRG (nean: 5 /section) was significantly lower than those of C 2 and C 3 DRGs. In 4 cases, HRP was injected into concha irrelevant to the scratch reflex. Labeled cells were very scarce in cervical DRGs but numerous in cranial nerve (VII, X) ganglia. 3) Labeled cells in C 1 -C 3 DRGs were spheroidal in shape and had mean diameters of 46 - 54 μm, 30 - 38 μm in their long and short axes, respectively. No somatotopic organization was observed within the ganglia. These results may indicate that pinna afferents of the scratch reflex enter the spinal cord predominantly through the C 1 to C 3 dorsal roots. It was suggested that pinna afferents may consist of thin myelinated or unmyelinated axons...|$|E
