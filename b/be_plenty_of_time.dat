25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think there will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. There will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error. He's made something that people will be eager to see and eager {{to talk about all}} over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing".|$|E
2500|$|Wyndham's {{performance}} was praised, {{and the play}} must have generated considerable interest: [...] On 24 December, the drama critic of The Illustrated London News had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was [...] "brilliantly successful, and will probably have a very long run; so there will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week. I hear the Fairy spoken of on all sides {{as one of the}} wittiest and as the most ingenious and daring of Mr Gilbert's dramatic productions." [...] Unfortunately, he never published his review – Fogerty's Fairy closed on 6 January 1882, before the next edition of his weekly paper. [...] It was not a success, playing only about 25 performances.|$|E
