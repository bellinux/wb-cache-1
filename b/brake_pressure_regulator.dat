50|$|Three {{versions}} of the brake were developed: for goods trains (KKgbr), passenger trains (KKpbr) and express trains (KKsbr). The goods wagon variant offered the option of switching between empty and loaded braking. The passenger train version was given an accelerator valve (Beschleunigungsventil) {{as well as a}} control valve. The express train brake had, in addition, a <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> in order to prevent the wheels locking when braking quickly.|$|E

5000|$|For the 1987 model year, the 944S [...] "Super" [...] was introduced. The 944S {{featured}} a high performance naturally aspirated, dual-overhead-cam 16-valve [...] {{version of the}} 2.5 L engine (M44/40) featuring a self-adjusting timing belt tensioner. This marked the first use of four-valve-per-cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series, derived from the 928 S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive, a magnesium intake tract/passages, magnesium valve cover, larger capacity oil sump, and revised exhaust system. The alternator capacity was 115 amps. The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful. Floating 944 calipers were standard, but the rear wheel <b>brake</b> circuit <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> from the 944 turbo was used. Small '16 Ventiler' script badges were added on the sides {{in front of the}} body protection mouldings. Performance was quoted as 0 - 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds (Best) and a 232 km/h top speed due to a 2857 lb weight. It also {{featured a}}n improved programmed Bosch Digital Motronic 2 Computer/DME with dual knock sensors for improved fuel performance for the higher 10.9:1 compression ratio cylinder head. Like the 944 Turbo, the 944S received progressive springs for greater handling, Larger front and rear anti-roll bars, revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 2.5 L DOHC higher 6800 rpm rev limit. Dual safety air bags, limited-slip differential, and ABS braking system were optional on the 944S.|$|R

Although many ways works with the black box, fuzzy logic will give powerful solution. The purpose of the research is looking for relation parameters between velocity and <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> of vehicle model that can be control to determine optimum brake distance of vehicle model by using rules base of fuzzy logic with verbose format.

40|$|Large mobile {{irrigation}} {{machines are}} becoming a common sight in Australian broadacre irrigation, replacing traditional surface methods. These machines give the potential of irrigating large areas with high efficiency and with a uniformity of above 80 % when designed correctly. A major component of the large mobile irrigation machine is the sprinkler application package commissioned with the machine. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> {{are becoming a}} common {{part of the package}} when large mobile irrigation machines are commissioned. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> are installed upstream of the nozzle and provide a constant output pressure regardless of the input pressure into the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The device acts as a variable headloss. Input pressure changes are a common occurrence on large mobile irrigation machines and typically are from topographic changes as the machines travel through the field. The application rate is directly influenced by the output pressure from the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> thus this shows the importance of accurately understanding to performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Reviewing previous literature it was known that the methodology development was a crucial part in understanding the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> performance. The development of a solid robust methodology was the primary objective of this dissertation. Eight stages of testing occurred each with incremental changes to develop the methodology for testing. The way the testing was undertaking proved to influence the results of the test. A statistical analysis in terms of an ANOVA and sample size calculations was undertaken on a limited set of data. It was found the for the 16 <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> tested the means were not equal. 88 <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> were found to be tested to understand manufacturing variation based on the normal model. The methodology by which the test was carried out was found to influence the outcome of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Each result needs to be interpreted with reference to the methodology.

5000|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies {{the amount of}} force applied to each of a vehicle's wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), EBD can apply more or less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to each wheel {{in order to maximize}} stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. [...] Typically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause a skid.
