During 1942 the trades hall was among a number of Toowoomba buildings that were occupied for military purposes, with tenants and other users required to relocate elsewhere following its occupation as the Headquarters Office for the No. 3 Advance Ordinance Depot of the Australian Military Forces. At this time, the Toowoomba Ruling Company occupied two rooms, the Trades and Labour Council, Toowoomba and East Toowoomba ALP branches and nine individual unions were regularly using spaces in the building, and other unions were renting on a casual basis.|$|E

50|$|Undeterred, in the {{following}} year, Hartnett set up as an automobile engineer, renting part of a Wallington <b>boot</b> <b>repair</b> shop and dealing in bicycles, motor bikes and cars. But the economy had grown sluggish and when this, too, failed he turned to earning a precarious living as a free lance automotive consultant. He obtained commissions with firms such as the Nyasa Consolidated Company which wanted him to inspect vehicles it was considering buying for its commercial operations in central and east Africa. But the pickings were meager and time weighed on his hands. In 1923 he sold a patent for improving insulators on radio aerials to a ceramics firm.|$|R
50|$|The Minister of Labour {{under the}} Trade Boards Act 1909 and the Trade Boards Act 1918 made an order {{applicable}} to <b>boot</b> and shop <b>repairing</b> called the Trade Boards (<b>Boot</b> and Shoe <b>Repairing)</b> Order 1919. This established a trade board to fix minimum rates of wages for managers and other classes {{of workers in}} the trade. It did so and the Minister of Labour confirmed them by an order on 8 August 1922. Mr France claimed the minimum wage applied to him from his employer, James Coombes & Co. He <b>repaired</b> <b>boots,</b> and so was physically working, for {{less than half the}} time he was in the shop. The employer contended that taking this into account he was receiving the minimum wage.|$|R
50|$|Tony Lama {{was born}} to Italian {{immigrant}} parents in 1887. He first learned the leather and boot trade as an 11 year-old shoemaker's apprentice in Syracuse, New York. In the early 20th century, Lama joined the U.S. Cavalry as a cobbler for the soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas. After completing his service in 1911, {{he stayed in the}} border town of El Paso, Texas. While there, Lama met and married Esther Hernandez, a pianist and music teacher. Soon after, he opened a small shoe and <b>boot</b> <b>repair</b> shop. Repairs were initially the biggest part of his business, but the boots he made soon became popular. In the first year, together with his one employee at the time, Lama sold 20 pairs of handcrafted boots.|$|R

His boots proved popular and he was commissioned to supply boots for the 1933 Everest expedition led by Hugh Ruttledge. [...] In 1935 he moved the business, now known as Robert Lawrie Ltd, to London, eventually working out of premises in his home in Seymour Street. He provided boots, climbing and mountaineering equipment to many expeditions including John Hunt's successful 1953 Everest campaign, for which he trained Wilfred Noyce in the art of <b>boot</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|R

This was replaced by a girder bridge in 1914. And beside the bridge, the Ballantyne family built a club for their workers to provide education and recreation, but definitely no alcohol. The Henry Ballantyne Memorial Institute, know to villagers as the ‘HB Club’ is still in existence providing a cosy bar and entertainment for the community.|$|R

[...] On the walk-in to the mountain, Noyce, together with Charles Evans, who had been designated as in charge of stores at the RGS meeting, were designated as the [...] "baggage party", in charge of the clothing and equipment for the approach. Noyce was also in charge of mountaineering equipment on the ascent itself, having been instructed in the <b>repair</b> of high-altitude <b>boots</b> ("I had worked for three days with Robert Lawrie's bootmakers, learning chiefly how to stick on micro-cellular rubber soles and heels"). Noyce's skills in <b>boot</b> <b>repair</b> were in demand on the ascent; according to Charles Wylie, the thin Vibram soles that were used on the boots often peeled off at the toes but Noyce [...] "saved the situation with some really professional repair work".|$|R
50|$|Vincent Street in Canning Town was by repute, in 1894, one of {{the worst}} streets in London. It was here, on a plot of ground {{provided}} by a supporter, that an iron mission church, St Alban and the English Martyrs, was built. The Rev G.F Gillett was appointed as the first Missioner. The church became a centre for a number of clubs and societies meeting a variety of practical and spiritual needs. In 1905 Kennedy-Cox, who had achieved success as a playwright with several plays on the London stage, resumed his volunteer work at the mission. In 1907 he decided to commit himself fully to the venture, gave up his theatrical career became a full-time mission staff member. Life {{in the early years of}} the mission was described as follows:"In those days the Mission consisted of a few dilapidated slum dwellings where the helpers lived and worked, and a tin roofed chapel in charge of a clergyman known as the missioner. Each night the local lads would come in, and after some frolicing turn out the gaslight and have a free for all, breaking the furniture in the process; gradually, however, they came to respect the Mission and the voluntary staff and accept them as friends, and besides cards, draughts and other games in the small cramped rooms, were taught carpentry and <b>boot</b> <b>repairing,</b> though more often than not their <b>boots</b> were beyond <b>repair.</b> An employment bureau was started which kept contact with local employers, and jumble clothing was distributed as fast as it could be collected".|$|R

They were periodically used for eating; the arm was also used {{for a variety of}} other tasks such as mending <b>boots,</b> house <b>repairs</b> and farm jobs. The final function of the dagger was as an obvious and ostentatious means of enhancing a man's personal apparel, conforming to fashion which dictated that all men carried them.|$|R
50|$|Boot {{trees are}} shoe trees for boots. Creases that {{form in the}} calves of boots can {{eventually}} cause zips to break, and a zip replacement can be an expensive repair. By investing {{in a pair of}} <b>boot</b> trees a <b>repair</b> like this can easily be avoided.|$|R

5000|$|Yoel Breckler, a Russian immigrant, {{founded the}} <b>boot</b> <b>repair</b> store Breckler Brothers in Fremantle, Western Australia, in 1892. This family {{business}} {{that he had}} established was continued by his wife Fanny Brecker (née Masel, 1877-1942) and two sons, Cecil and Alec, {{after his death in}} 1912. Fanny opened the first store in Hay Street in the 1920s. The company has since changed its name at various times in its long history, including Cecil Bros, and Betts. In 1985, Andrew and Danny Breckler took over the family's business. The recent introduction of major suburban retail shopping centres had brought in competition from both national and international players. This development had created a difficult situation for local retailers, and put pressure on sales and margins. To combat this, Andrew started to expand the operations into the states of Victoria, New South Wales and the Northern Territory, with the aid of numerous acquisitions the company had made in the 1980s and early 1990s. During this time, Andrew helped the company become the [...] "largest privately owned footwear group in Australia". At the turn of the millennium, Danny, who was faced with a second surge of increased competition, repositioned the Betts Group, thereby changing it into a [...] "vertically integrated business that could design and source its own products". The brand Zu Shoes was established in March 2003, and Danny soon started designing and developing footwear products and accessories for manufacture in China. To reduce the level of third-party involvement in acquiring product from Chinese manufacturers, he also developed the Betts Group China Resource Centre, which handled quality control and transportation.|$|R
