5|$|In 64 emperor Nero {{appointed}} Gessius Florus as procurator of the Judaea Province. During his administration, the Jews were systematically {{discriminated against}} {{in favour of}} the Greek population of the region. Tensions quickly rose to civil unrest when Florus plundered the treasury of the Temple of Jerusalem {{under the guise of}} imperial taxes. Following riots, the instigators were arrested and crucified by the Romans. Appalled at the treatment of her countrymen, Berenice travelled to Jerusalem in 66 to personally petition Florus to spare the Jews, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> did he refuse to comply with her requests, Berenice herself was nearly killed during skirmishes in the city. Likewise a plea for assistance to the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, met with no response.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>only,</b> Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E

Honor killings have also taken place in immigrant communities in Europe, Canada and the U.S. In some parts of the world, honor killings enjoy considerable public support: in one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan's capital city, Amman, approved of honor killings. A survey in Diyarbakir, Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} the {{seriousness}} and confidence in the opinion polls in the political domain is extremely controversial in Romania. Many people, especially members and supporters of the opposition, consider that the political affiliations of {{the directors of the}} main opinion polling firms have a significant impact in their results. For example, Sociopol is led by Mirel Palada, former spokesman for the government of Victor Ponta, while GSSC Avangarde is led by sociologist Marius Pieleanu, a confidant of the Conservative Party. The honorary president of CSCI is Bogdan Teodorescu, one of the strategists of Victor Ponta's campaign during these presidential elections. The main shareholder of IRES is Vasile Dâncu, former PSD senator. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the ruling party has tangents with the opinion polls. CCSCC published the results of a fictional survey during the European Parliament election of 25 May 2014, at liberal Horea Uioreanu's command, subsequently taken into custody for corruption.|$|E

During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour.

[...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E

[...] The kiss was shot in profile, locked lips clearly visible, rather than using the normal angle for same-sex kisses, in which the partner's head blocks the view of the actual contact. The scene was considered so racy that the episode was banned from being shown in Singapore. [...] The episode won its time slot among young adult viewers during its showing in the November 1999 sweeps, even beating Monday Night Football. [...] Ling made the [...] "damn hot kiss" [...] even hotter because [...] "she's the exotic, erotic experimenter of the group", according to Scott Seomin, media director at that time for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.|$|E

500|$|Around 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H. Ahl {{had written}} a version of The Sumer Game in the BASIC programming language. Unlike FOCAL, BASIC was run not just on mainframe computers and minicomputers, but also on personal computers, then termed microcomputers, making it a much more popular language. In 1973, Ahl published BASIC Computer Games, a best-selling book of games written in BASIC, which included his version of The Sumer Game. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi and added an end-of-game performance appraisal. The popularity of both {{the book and the}} programming language itself meant that Ahl's version of the game became the more widely known version over the relatively obscure original, as evidenced by the 1973 French FOCAL version considering [...] "Hamurabi" [...] to be the more prominent name. BASIC Computer Games noted that the game was a modification of a game [...] "written in FOCAL at DEC", but listed the author as [...] "unknown." [...] The 1978 edition of the book, which was the first million-selling computer book, noted that the game's name was intended to be [...] "Hammurabi", the correct spelling of the Babylonian king, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> was one [...] "m" [...] dropped in the file name to fit in an eight-character limit, but Ahl consistently misspelled the name inside of the game, leading to the generally accepted name of the game to be Hamurabi.|$|E
