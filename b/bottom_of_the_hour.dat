25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As The World Turns from July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with All My Children did trouble really began for As the World Turns (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As The World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour).</b> Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As the World Turns (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As The World Turns from the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens, As the World Turns fell to fourth behind All My Children, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless.|$|E
25|$|Although {{extended}} promotional breaks {{were shown}} in a somewhat limited form beforehand, partially {{as a result of}} the changes that occurred in 1988, breaks between individual feature presentations on the channel sometimes ran as long as 20 minutes, and even up to 25 minutes in rare cases, depending on the scheduled airtime of the next film (which was denoted on a minute-based countdown ticker graphic that persisted within breaks from May 1988 to August 1997; Showtime would implement a similar countdown graphic for the next scheduled program as part of a branding update in January 1990, which that network would discontinue following its August 1997 rebrand). The Movie Channel temporarily truncated the length of its promotional breaks to five minutes or less in an on-air strategical test during February and March 1993, dispensing of fixed start times at the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> – at which most of TMC's weekday daytime film telecasts had been scheduled, along with some films aired in other dayparts, since the 1988 format revamp – in favor of airtimes set at top-of-the-hour, bottom-of-the-hour and random five-minute intervals regardless of daypart. After results from the test measured an increase in audience retention for other films with the strategy, the channel instituted the limited break lengths on a regular basis in August of that year; TMC abandoned the break limits in 1997. The break limits imposed by the channel resulted in TMC reducing the number of internally produced interstitial segments that it aired during promotional breaks, with interstitials airing over the next four years consisting mainly of trailers and shorter-length behind-the-scenes segments for upcoming and current films produced by their originating studios.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a single}} window in our cell, which {{was too small to}} admit a child. It was further defended by a thick iron bar in the centre. It was not a very {{promising}} point of escape, as you will allow, but I became more and more convinced that our efforts must be directed towards it. To make matters worse, it only led out into the exercise yard, which was surrounded by two high walls. Still, as I said to my sullen comrade, it is time to talk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vistula when you are over the Rhine. I got a small piece of iron, therefore, from <b>the</b> fittings <b>of</b> my bed, and I set to work to loosen the plaster at the top and <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bar. Three <b>hours</b> I would work, and then leap into my bed upon <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warder's step.

40|$|In the {{previous}} reports the author {{revealed that the}} stomach has an active ability to absorb the iron, but this absorption ceases at a certain period with the elevated pH level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach contents. In this paper the author presents <b>the</b> absorption process <b>of</b> iron by <b>the</b> mucosa cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach as revealed histochemically. After the operation as described in Part 1 the iron was introduced into the stomach in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> ferric or ferrous iron, and the animals were sacrificed at fixed intervals and the mucosa cells from three different parts of stomach, pyrolus, fundus aud cardiac parts, were observed by both Perls' direct and Okamoto's indirect methods for <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> iron. By Perls' method the iron {{can be seen in}} <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach covering the mucous membrane first and then it enters gradually into <b>the</b> canaliculi <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mucous membrane reaching almost <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canaliculi 6 <b>hours</b> after <b>the</b> iron introduction, but by this method no iron can be detected in the cells. By Okamoto's method the iron taken into the mncosa cells can be detected. During <b>the</b> first 2 <b>hours</b> iron can not be seen in the cell but after 3 <b>hours</b> <b>the</b> cells situated near the inner surface show the positive reaction, and after 6 <b>hours</b> all <b>the</b> cells including those lying at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canaliculi give a positive reaction. The iron can be detected as the fine granules in the cytoplasm. Nuclei also give a positive reaction but this will be an artefact. Therefore, the positive iron reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mucosa cells becomes marked when <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron level in blood actually stops. From these observations the author concludes that at <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> absorption <b>the</b> iron can easily go through the mucosa cells immigrating from the stomach to blood rapidly without causing any retention <b>of</b> iron in <b>the</b> mucosa cell, but when the serum is saturated with iron then the iron is retained in the mucosa cells giving <b>the</b> positive reaction <b>of</b> iron. These facts will show that <b>the</b> absorption <b>of</b> iron in stomach can be regulated by two ways, <b>the</b> pH level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach contents and <b>the</b> iron-binding capacity <b>of</b> serum...|$|R
