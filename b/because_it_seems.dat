25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate how many temples were closed during the turmoil, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> likely that many disappeared simply because Buddhist authorities, {{taking advantage of the}} fall of the Tokugawa, were trying to streamline the system and eliminate redundancies. Under the shogunate, obtaining the permission to open or close a temple had not been easy. However, the complete disappearance of Buddhist temples from domains like Satsuma was indeed due to the haibutsu kishaku.|$|E

This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).|$|E

Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me the best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of such a system of collectors would alter the light emitted from the star system. Collectors would absorb and reradiate energy from the star.

500|$|The Fugees' second album, The Score (1996), {{peaked at}} {{number one on}} the U.S. Billboard 200 and stayed in the top ten of that chart for over half a year. It sold about six million copies in the United States and more than 17 million copies worldwide. In the 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll, The Score came second in the list of best albums and three of its tracks placed within the top twenty best singles. It won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and was later {{included}} on Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Almost all of the writing and producing for it was done by Jean. The Score garnered praise for being a strong alternative to the gangsta idiom, and Hill stated, [...] "We're trying to do something positive with the music <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> like only the negative is rising to the top these days.

Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story, grading it as an [...] "F" [...] and calling it [...] "a pastiche {{of a large number of}} manga and anime clichés, not <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> like it was intended to be a pastiche, but because the manga artist [...] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent, unified storyline that is his own, original creation." [...] However, Brienza did praise the artwork, grading it as an [...] "A" [...] and calling it rich and [...] "beautifully drawn".

Particularly, Stan {{felt that she was}} very [...] "pleased with the collaboration, because [...] really wanted to work with Romanian artists, not just with Romanian producers like on [...] second studio album." [...] She talked about the choosing of Connect-R as the guest vocalist for [...] "Vanilla Chocolat":"I chose Connect-R <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that he can [...] "deal" [...] with every music genre, because he is flexible and he can continue even with every unexpected change or sound combination. Connect-R can also sing in every language without any problems, because he believes in his own work. We met at the Fonogram Studios, and we started 'half seriously and jokingly' to work on the song, along with Alex Cotoi. The result is 'sweet and fragrant'.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} between his return from Paris in 1908 and the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two {{of the largest and most}} prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian, were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, [...] "The work is wonderful <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is never sure whether one is listening to something very old or very new". Langford declared that the symphony [...] "definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers". Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams's largest-scale work was the first version of A London Symphony (1914). In the same year he wrote The Lark Ascending in its original form for violin and piano.|$|E
