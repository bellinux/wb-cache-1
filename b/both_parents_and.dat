5|$|W8 {{is found}} in one Icelandic horse with sabino-like white spotting, mottling, and roaning. <b>Both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> four {{maternal}} half-siblings, all non-white, were found without the W8 allele. The W8 allele is also a splice site mutation (c.2222-1G>A), located on Intron15.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are fed by <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often {{in the company of}} Redwings.|$|E

5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she {{will remain in the}} nest and continuously incubate them until hatching.

This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Geldray {{took part}} in the Normandy {{landings}} with the Prinses Irene Brigade, but was injured by a bomb blast and spent time in a military hospital. Although he did not incur long-term injuries, he suffered from recurring nightmares in the following years. After the liberation of Amsterdam, Geldray travelled to the city to find his parents who had been resident when the Germans invaded. He found that <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> his sister Xaviere had been killed in a concentration camp by the Nazis. At the end of the war, Geldray returned to Paris and once again found work with Ray Ventura's orchestra for two years, before returning to London in 1947.|$|E

5|$|Presley {{was born}} on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith; 1912–1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (1916–1979), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in {{preparation}} for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth. Jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at Priceville Cemetery in Tupelo. After Presley became famous, he asked people on several occasions to try and find the whereabouts of Jesse. The efforts were to no avail, because no papers marked the spot. Presley became close to <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was in conflict with the Pentecostal church in his later years, he never officially left it. Rev. Rex Humbard officiated at Presley's funeral, because Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's ministry.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments {{in the mind of}} the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as he was forced to make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> one of her brothers at a young age. At 15, she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its feminist headmistress Marie Souvestre. Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, Sara, and after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in a public life of her own. She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with debilitating polio in 1921, which cost him the normal use of his legs, and Roosevelt began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. Following Franklin's election as Governor of New York in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf, and as First Lady while her husband served as President, she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of that office during her own tenure and beyond, for future First Ladies.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{describes}} no-fault or unilateral divorce {{based on}} no fault {{as a power}} grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states that fathers have {{a constitutional right to}} shared control of their children and through political action they intend to establish parental authority for <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> for the well-being of their children. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.|$|E
25|$|Unlike nuclear DNA, {{which is}} {{inherited}} from <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> in which genes are rearranged {{in the process}} of recombination, there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Although mtDNA also recombines, it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion. Because of this and because the mutation rate of animal mtDNA is higher than that of nuclear DNA, mtDNA is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females (matrilineage) and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations.|$|E
25|$|The house's {{adaptability}} {{to commercial}} activities {{is due in}} part to its size and central location near the plaza and the bayfront. Andres Ximenez built the structure to accommodate his family upstairs and support them through undertakings housed downstairs.

25|$|The clutch size is {{typically}} 3 or 4 eggs, {{with an average}} of 3.2 being reported. Eggs are laid on alternate days, so that hatching within clutches is highly asynchronous; with some young hatching up to a week apart. Incubation begins after the 2nd or 3rd egg is laid, is carried out by <b>both</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> lasts 29–32 days. The eggs are oval or subelliptical, and mean egg measurements are 75.19mm in length and 52.56mm in width; with maximum egg measurements of 77.4mm in length and 56.2mm in breadth having been recorded. The eggs are also said to be disproportionately small compared to the laying female's body mass.|$|E
