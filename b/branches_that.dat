5|$|In 1054, Yaropolk {{became the}} son of the Grand Prince, as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's {{security}} were however quickly challenged by Izyaslav's brother Svyatoslav and by his cousin Vseslav Briacheslavich. At this time among the Rurikids, there were two senior <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> could claim the Grand Princeship through descent from Vladimir the Great; namely, the descendents of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} had three <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> included a legislature, judiciary, and executive branch. The executive branch was first the Executive Committee, consisting of three members, in effect from 1843 to 1845; in 1845, a single governor position was created. The judicial branch {{had a single}} Supreme Judge along with several lower courts, and a legislative committee of nine served as a legislature until 1845 when the Oregon House of Representatives was established.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora anthocephala is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance, {{but can be}} distinguished by <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> taper upward, branch tips that are flattened (instead of spoon-like), {{and the lack of}} a fetid odor. The North American species T.vialis has smaller spores and a more variable color. Darker Ramaria species are distinguished by their non-leathery flesh texture and pointy branch tips.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are {{leathery}} and coral-like, with <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> are narrow at the base before widening out like a fan and splitting into numerous flattened prongs. The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and mixed forest.|$|E

5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two southern <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E

5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria botrytis include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter spores. Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has <b>branches</b> <b>that</b> are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth spores. The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has reddish to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to reddish, R.subbotrytis has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E
