40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Navy report addressed {{four of the five}} elements specified in House Report 112 - 78, while partially addressing one of the five elements. The Navy report addressed the potential for reducing maintenance and repair costs for the Navys small boat fleet by using advanced <b>boat</b> <b>lifts,</b> and it addressed recommendations regarding the potential establishment of improved boat corrosion control and prevention as key performance parameters. The Navy report partially addressed the committees direction to include an evaluation and business case analysis of the impact of advanced <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> for potential improvements to small boat acquisition costs and life-cycle sustainment. The reports business case analysis evaluated potential improvements to life-cycle sustainment, focusing on potential maintenance cost savings associated with <b>boat</b> <b>lifts.</b> However, this business case analysis did not evaluate the impact of the use of advanced <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> on potential improvements to small boat acquisition costs. Navy officials told GAO that the use of advanced <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> would not significantly contribute to extending the service life of the boats or produce any other additional benefits that would lead to reduced small boat acquisition costs. This is primarily because a critical feature of current procurement strategies is to select, specify, or design boats that are made from corrosion-resistant materials and use components that are corrosion resistant. Nonetheless, the Navy did not include this justification in the report or analyze the potential effects of the use of <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> on small <b>boat</b> acquisition costs in the reports business case analysis. ...|$|R
5|$|The Falkirk Wheel is a {{rotating}} <b>boat</b> <b>lift</b> in Scotland, connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. The lift {{is named after}} the town it resides in of Falkirk in central Scotland. It opened in 2002, reconnecting the two canals {{for the first time}} since the 1930s as part of the Millennium Link project.|$|E
5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and {{was capable of}} {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long and capable of carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. The lifts predated the Anderton <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift</b> by nearly 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{just below}} Northwich, the Anderton <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift</b> {{is now the}} normal route for leisure boats to reach the river. Following its closure in 1983, a Trust was created to {{campaign}} for its restoration. The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more hydraulically powered. The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of portable <b>boat</b> <b>lifts,</b> <b>boat</b> <b>lifting</b> work could only be performed at shops or locations that had access to cranes, machines, forklifts, or similar lifting equipment. Portable lifts allow individuals, professional boat and boat trailer mechanics, boat and boat trailer painters or anyone needing to separate a boat from a trailer the ability to perform the work by themselves away from a shop.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{the death}} of Carroll on July 26, 1977, Bishop Edward Anthony McCarthy was {{appointed}} as Miami's archbishop. McCarthy oversaw {{the construction of the}} Pastoral Center for the archdiocese and restructured most senior operational divisions. He established the Office of Lay Ecclesial Ministry, the Office of Evangelization and the Permanent Diaconate program. In 1980, he offered support and assistance during the Mariel <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift.</b> The following year, he supported the rights of Haitian immigrants who were detained under the Wet Foot, Dry Foot policy. Responding to the needs of this new immigration, he opened the Pierre Toussaint Haitian Catholic Center. McCarthy retired in 1994 at the required age of 75.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical <b>boat</b> <b>lift</b> was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E
25|$|The Victorian Anderton <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift,</b> the world's first {{vertical}} <b>boat</b> <b>lift,</b> {{linking the}} Trent and Mersey Canal and the River Weaver in Cheshire, {{has recently been}} restored.

25|$|To {{raise the}} £7 million {{restoration}} cost, a partnership was forged between the Waterways Trust, the Inland Waterways Association, the Anderton <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift</b> Trust, the Friends of Anderton <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift,</b> the Association of Waterways Cruising Clubs, British Waterways and the Trent and Mersey Canal Society. Heritage Lottery Funding contributed £3.3 million, {{and more than}} 2,000 individuals contributed to the scheme, raising a further £430,000.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1875, the <b>boat</b> <b>lift</b> was in use {{for over}} 100 years {{until it was}} closed due to {{corrosion}} in 1983.

25|$|In July 1872, Royal Assent {{was granted}} for the Weaver Navigation 1872 Act, which {{authorised}} {{the construction of}} the <b>boat</b> <b>lift.</b> The contract for its construction was awarded to Emmerson, Murgatroyd & Co. of Stockport and Liverpool. Work started before the end of 1872 and took 30 months. The Anderton <b>Boat</b> <b>Lift</b> was formally opened to traffic on 26 July 1875. The total cost was £48,428 (£ at today's prices).|$|E
25|$|At the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in China {{there are}} two stairsteps of five large ship locks (each 300 m long and 35 m wide) for ten-thousand-tonne ships.

The locks and the <b>boat</b> <b>lift</b> provide a total lift of up to 113 metres.|$|E
25|$|The <b>boat</b> <b>lift</b> at Longtan is {{reported}} to be even higher in total with a maximum vertical lift of 179m in two stages when completed.|$|E
25|$|Special tolls {{existed for}} use of <b>boat</b> <b>lifts,</b> {{inclined}} planes and tunnels, but companies {{were not allowed to}} charge different tolls for special customers or over different parts of the line until 1845 (the Canal Tolls Act).|$|R

50|$|The dual lifts are {{the highest}} {{hydraulic}} <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> in the world, rising 19.8 m. This was a considerable accomplishment when conventional locks usually only had a 2 m rise. Each lift has a capacity of 1,300 tonnes.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{hydraulic}} <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> {{on the old}} Canal du Centre, which connects the Meuse River to the Scheldt. These double elevators date from around 1900 and were designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1998.|$|R
50|$|A {{southern}} breakwater {{was constructed}} in 1962 and land reclaimed to house fishing companies and service industries. Between 1969 and 1972, up to 120 fishing boats were housed in the harbour and in 1982, construction of a <b>boat</b> <b>lifting</b> facility commenced.|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} these early lifts was the one {{constructed}} at Mells on the Dorset and Somerset Canal. Lifts on the tub boat section of the Grand Western Canal entered into operation in 1835 becoming the first non experimental <b>boat</b> <b>lifts</b> in Britain.|$|R
