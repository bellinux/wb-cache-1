It seemed like an age <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the ball {{in my hands and}} then, as I looked over to first, it seemed like the longest throw I ever had to make. The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.|$|E
60|$|MORELL. They left long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away: I thought I {{should never}} escape. I {{believe they are}} having supper somewhere.|$|E
60|$|FITZSIMMONS. [Exultantly.] A bit tight! Why, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> you to bed you {{insisted on}} {{telling me the}} story of your life.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} climb to the higher range of rocks almost at the same spot by which I had descended from them--judging by the close thunder {{of the water in}} the chasm. Halfway up, I stopped at a broad resting-place; and found that I must proceed a little, either to the right or to the left, in a {{horizontal}} direction, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>get</b> higher. At that moment, the mist was slowly brightening again. I looked first to the left, to see where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> good foothold--then to the right, towards the outer sides of the riven rocks close at hand.|$|R

'Yes; he {{recognised}} {{you immediately}} when he recovered himself, {{and he has}} admitted to me since that he has seen you <b>before,</b> though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> much out of him about it. He will talk for ever about Arabia, faith, war, and angels; but, if you touch on anything personal, I observe he is always very shy. He has not my fatal frankness. Did you know him at Jerusalem?' ...|$|R
60|$|My cold {{sticks to}} me, and I can {{scarcely}} exaggerate what I sometimes undergo from sleeplessness. The day <b>before</b> yesterday <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> no rest until morning, and <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> up before twelve. This morning the same. I rarely take any breakfast but an egg {{and a cup}} of tea, not even toast or bread-and-butter. My dinner at three, and a little quail or some such light thing when I come home at night, is my daily fare. At the Hall I have established the custom of taking an egg beaten up in sherry before going in, and another between the parts. I think that pulls me up; at all events, I have since had no return of faintness.|$|R
60|$|And then I saw she {{was going}} to start something, and I bleated weakly to Jeeves to bring me tea. But she had begun <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "'We've got to skip,' I {{whispered to}} him, putting my mouth {{close to the}} crack of the door and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away he cried, oh! so mournfully: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} rectory-gate. Mr. Finch intercepted me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> round to {{our side of}} the house. He held up before me, in solemn triumph, a {{manuscript}} of many pages.|$|E
6000|$|By way of {{contrast}} we rode out into old ruined Rome, {{after all this}} firing and booming, to take our leave of the Coliseum. I had seen it by moonlight <b>before</b> (<b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>get</b> through a day without going back to it), but its tremendous solitude that night is past all telling. The ghostly pillars in the Forum; the Triumphal Arches of Old Emperors; those enormous masses of ruins which were once their palaces; the grass-grown mounds that mark the graves of ruined temples; the stones of the Via Sacra, smooth with the tread of feet in ancient Rome; even these were dimmed, in their transcendent melancholy, by the dark ghost of its bloody holidays, erect and grim; haunting the old scene; despoiled by pillaging Popes and fighting Princes, but not laid; wringing wild hands of weed, and grass, and bramble; and lamenting to the night in every gap and broken arch--the shadow of its awful self, immovable! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the time}} we got there till pretty nigh night. Then he said I was {{to go down to the}} pasture an' bring up the cows. Well, now, I'm a dandy to bring up cows! Never saw one <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't goin' to let on that I didn't know the whole thing, so I walked down big as life. He told me where the pasture was, an' I cleaned her right out. Took every blamed thing in there an' drove 'em up. Well, you jest bet he was mad! He wanted to know why I didn't leave the oxen behind, an' what I was doin' with the sheep, an' how I ever {{expected}} to catch them two colts ag'in? I asked him to tell me how I was goin' to sort 'em out when they was runnin' all 'round. Said I was hungry, an' didn't have time for sich jobs. Why, Teddy, there was one of them sheep what had horns on; I couldn't have got rid of it if I'd stayed there a month. Knocked me down twice <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even <b>get</b> the bars fixed. He acted like the goats you see up in Shantytown, an' looked a good deal like Skip Jellison in the face. I didn't figger on sheep bein' ugly. I wasn't so awful scared at first, for I 'lowed he was playin', an' got up soon's <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> The next thing I was down ag'in like one of them babies at a fair what you throw balls at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{the time}} I {{talked to him}} I didn't see a muscle move in his face," [...] Jethro continued, [...] "so I started in again, and he looked--looked--looked right at me. W-wouldn't wink--don't think he winked once while I was in that room. I watched him as close as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>I</b> watched {{to see if a}} muscle moved or if I was makin' any impression. All he would do was to stand there and look--look--look. K-kept me there ten minutes and never opened his mouth at all. Hardest man to talk to I ever met--never see a man <b>before</b> but what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him to say somethin', if it was only a cuss word. I got tired of it after a while, made up my mind that I had found one man I couldn't move. Then what bothered me was {{to get out of that}} room. If I'd a had a Bible I believe I'd a read it to him. I didn't know what to say, but I did say this after a while:--"'W-well, Mr. President, I guess I've kept you long enough--g-guess you're a pretty busy man. H-hope you'll give Mr. Prescott that postmastership. Er--er good-by.' ...|$|R
60|$|A {{minute later}} {{we were in}} the street and walking for home. We had crossed Oxford Street and were half way down Harley Street <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a word from my companion.|$|E
60|$|My {{bad night}} made it {{late in the}} morning, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to Mr. Franklin Blake. I found him {{stretched}} on the sofa, breakfasting on brandy and soda-water, and a dry biscuit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Store!"--a fine scorn was {{expressed}} by Daisy's uptilted nose--"sardine box! Waitin' for me, you say? Gee! you'd {{have to throw}} out about a hundred pounds of candy <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> inside of it, Joe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another second, and I heard a most {{tremendous}} crashing noise. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{think what}} to do, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even <b>get</b> up, the bush behind me seemed to burst asunder, and there appeared not eight yards from us, the great horn and wicked twinkling {{eye of a}} charging rhinoceros. He had winded us or my pipe, I do not know which, and, after the fashion of these brutes, had charged up the scent. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not rise, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not even <b>get</b> the gun up, I had no time. All that I {{was able to do}} was to roll over as far out of the monster's path as the bush would allow. Another second and he was over me, his great bulk towering above me like a mountain, and, upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> his smell out of my nostrils for a week. Circumstances impressed it on my memory, at least I suppose so. His hot breath blew upon my face, one of his front feet just missed my head, and his hind one actually trod upon the loose part of my trousers and pinched a little bit of my skin. I saw him pass over me lying as I was upon my back, and next second I saw something else. My men were a little behind me, and therefore straight {{in the path of the}} rhinoceros. One of them flung himself backwards into the bush, and thus avoided him. The second with a wild yell sprung to his feet, and bounded like an india-rubber ball right into the aloe bush, landing well among the spikes. But the third, it was my friend Gobo, could not by any means get away. He managed to gain his feet, and that was all. The rhinoceros was charging with his head low; his horn passed between Gobo's legs, and feeling something on his nose, he jerked it up. Away went Gobo, high into the air. He turned a complete somersault at the apex of the curve, and as he did so, I caught sight of his face. It was gray with terror, and his mouth was wide open. Down he came, right on to the great brute's back, and that broke his fall. Luckily for him the rhinoceros never turned, but crashed straight through the aloe bush, only missing the man who had jumped into it by about a yard.|$|R
6000|$|The frigate {{followed}} the cutter, though she passed us outside, even nearer than her consort. I {{got my first}} accurate notion {{of the weight of}} the gale, by seeing this large ship drive past us, under a reefed fore-sail, and a close-reefed main-top-sail, running nearly dead before it. As she came down, she took a sheer, like a vessel scudding in the open ocean; and, at one moment, I feared she would plunge directly into us, though she minded her helm in time to clear everything. A dozen officers on board her were looking at us, from her gangway, her quarter-deck guns, and rigging. All were compelled to hold on with firm grasps; and wonder seemed painted in every countenance. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see their features for half a minute only, or even a less time; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> discern this expression in each face. Some looked up at our spars, as if to ascertain whether all were right; while others looked back at the head-land they had just rounded, like those who examined the roadstead. Most shook their heads, as remarks passed from one to the other. The captain, as I took him to be, spoke us. [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] came to me through a trumpet, plainly enough; but answering was out of the question. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even <b>get</b> a trumpet to my mouth, the frigate had gone foaming by, and was already {{beyond the reach of the}} voice. Heads appeared over her taffrail for some time, and we fancied these man-of-war's men regarded us as the instructed are apt to regard the ignorant, whom they fancy to be in danger. Marble sneered a little at the curiosity betrayed by these two crafts; but, as for myself, it caused great uneasiness. I fancied they acted like those who were acquainted with the coast, manifesting surprise at seeing a stranger anchored in the berth we occupied.|$|R
6000|$|... "The one that, ages ago, one {{day when}} you and Van were here, we had the joke about. You {{produced}} it, in sport, as a 'fine' for something, {{and put it on}} that table; after which, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> knew what you were about, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run after you, you had gone off and ridiculously left it. Of course the next minute--and again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> turn round--Harold had pounced on it, and I tried in vain to recover it from him. But all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him to do--" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} one o'clock <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{to the hotel}} to-day. The visit, even in my {{shattered}} condition, {{proved to be a}} most amusing one--thanks entirely to the presence on the scene of Gabriel Betteredge.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{stretched}} {{out my hand}} first, but then I called out, 'I'd be burned in the flames <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> within three yards of you.' So then he said, 'Well, help me with your prayers,' and so I do.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had no {{difficulty}} {{in getting the}} clothes for your brother-in-law," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{had to go to}} two or three shops <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> coat and breeches wide enough for you. What do you intend to do with your horses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Captain Cuffe," [...] {{answered}} Griffin, who found himself compelled to appear a delinquent, whatever {{might be the}} injustice of the stiuation; [...] "it could not be helped. We got in in proper time; and I went {{to work with the}} deputy-governor and an old chap of a magistrate who was with him, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up to the house of the first. Yvard had been beforehand with me: and I had to under-run about a hundred of his lying yarns <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even enter the end of an idea of my own--" ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} on the parapet. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> move, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cry out, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even breathe again freely, she leaped into the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Miss Dewey. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> rid of Hen, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage {{well enough}} with mother. Mr. Wemmel would marry me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the divorce. He's said so {{over and over}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Knees," [...] he repeated, quietly. [...] "It came {{slowly down}} the path, and half way to the house it stopped, and in a frightened sort of voice called out my name. I was surprised, naturally, but <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to it-- to reassure it--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I sent last evening," [...] said Mr. Holiday. [...] "It is {{necessary}} to engage the places beforehand at this season. There is so much travelling into Switzerland now that the diligences are all full. I had to send to three offices <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> places." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear--" [...] I {{was going}} {{to explain to her}} that in a {{question}} of such enormous public interest as this of the Fixed Period it was impossible to consider the merits of individual cases. But she interrupted me again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out a word.|$|E
6000|$|Clementina laughed. [...] "No; but I expect you'll think it's {{almost as}} crazy. You {{know how much}} I like dancing? Well, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give dancing lessons at the Middlemount. There are always a good many children, and girls that have not grown up, and <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> pupils enough, {{as long as the}} summa lasted; and come winter, I'm not afraid but what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> them among the young folks at the Center.

6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> a chance!" [...] {{he thought}} miserably. [...] "I know I am not idle or lazy--I know I can work--if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{a chance to}} prove it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He's a limb," [...] {{declared}} Mr. Harrison. [...] "He {{came over}} here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger's tail <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{in from the}} barn. The poor bird has been moping ever since.

6000|$|... "I'd enjoy it," [...] said Andrew grimly. [...] "However, {{now that}} we have come so far, we can't waste time in going back, and I've no doubt it would be a week or two <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the goods.

60|$|Then I {{began to}} fish for {{bonefish}} {{in front of my}} cottage. Whenever I would stick my rod in the sand and go in out of the hot sun a bonefish would take my bait and start off to sea. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back he would break something.|$|E
