25|$|Gleeson {{grew up in}} Warrnambool, Victoria as {{a member}} of a sports-mad family, with four older {{siblings}} who were all good in their chosen sports of football, basketball and swimming. As a child, Gleeson would sneak as close as he could to the Melbourne Tigers bench to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> legendary coach Lindsay Gaze and his players during Warrnambool's annual Seaside Basketball tournament every Australia Day weekend. Gleeson was keen on basketball in his youth and w{{as a member of}} Warrnambool's under 14 team which finished third at the Australian championships. In 1985, he graduated from Warrnambool's Emmanuel College.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and {{most parts of the}} frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones {{was not part of the}} normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E

[...] Shortly after takeoff, Cooper handed {{a note to}} Florence Schaffner, the flight attendant situated nearest {{to him in a}} jump seat attached to the aft stair door. Schaffner, assuming the note contained a lonely businessman's phone number, dropped it unopened into her purse. Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, [...] "Miss, you'd <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that note. I have a bomb." ...|$|E

500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get <b>better....</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|The {{site was}} first rediscovered by {{accident}} in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled {{against one of}} the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the bracken. After the bracken on the heath was burned away, something that took place periodically to encourage new growth, Hamilton returned to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the circle. He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, who put him in touch with the archaeologist Harold St George Gray. Gray then accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, at which point he made a survey of the ring.|$|E
2500|$|As more {{governors}} and delegates arrived, crowds of local onlookers and politicians began to gather {{on the train}} platform beside the hotel to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dignified guests. [...] Even General John Alexander McClernand and staff, who were passing through Altoona, decided to observe the spectacle. [...] Also in attendance was a reporter from the New York Herald. (The article about the conference appeared {{on the front page}} of this periodical on September 29, 1862.) [...] The day before the meeting was to begin, the governors who had arrived so far took a sight-seeing trip to the famous Horseshoe Curve, compliments of John Edgar Thomson and the Pennsylvania Railroad.|$|E

Talented and imaginative beyond the ordinary, his eyes gazing towards distant horizons, he was liable to neglect what lay immediately before his feet." ...|$|R

2500|$|While on an {{airplane}} once, Dean saw an advertisement in a magazine for a liquor company featuring a beautiful woman standing in water in a provocative pose holding a drink {{similar to the way}} Playboy posed models. [...] This led to an idea that changed the way guitars were marketed. Dean created his own ads that caused a wave of controversy. [...] Guitar ads for Deanâ€™s company were featuring bikini-clad models wearing guitars. [...] His early music magazine print ads and trade show marketing used female models from Playboy, and [...] it was this marketing that filled NAMM Show (National Association of Music Merchants) event aisles with merchants seeking to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the guitars (and models) that were quickly becoming the talk of the industry. [...] When Dean was warned by the trade show officials at one show that he had better tone it down in order to help keep the aisles clear, he knew he was on to something.|$|E
2500|$|Still Eisenhower faced {{criticism}} in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon's speech only said the mission was [...] "under the aegis of" [...] the president, not [...] "directed by." [...] Press reports were creating {{a belief in the}} public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. President. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: [...] "They had <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their own [...] record." [...] As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.|$|E
