50|$|<b>Beauty</b> <b>Case</b> was an Australian {{television}} series which aired from 12 February to 5 November 1958 on Sydney station TCN-9. The weekly series was broadcast on Wednesdays. TV listings suggest the episodes usually aired in a 45-minute time-slot. Unusual time-slots (such as 35 minures, 25 minutes and even 5 minutes) were not unheard of on early Australian television. Assuming the series had a sponsor, {{it is not}} known what the running time was minus the commercials.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue against}} the halfer {{response}} to the Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> by presenting a new problem for halfers. When the original Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> is generalized, it follows from the halfer’s key premise that Beauty must update her credence in a fair coin’s landing heads {{in such a way}} that it becomes arbitrarily close to certainty. This result is clearly absurd. I go on to argue that the halfer’s key premise must be rejected on pain of absurdity, leaving the halfer {{response to the}} original Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> unsupported. I consider two ways that halfers might avoid the absurdity without giving up their key premise. Neither way succeeds. My argument lends support to the thirder response, and, in particular, to the idea that agents may be rationally compelled to update their beliefs despite not having learned any new evidence...|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} main {{points of the}} paper. 1. There are {{straightforward}} ways of manipulating expected gains and losses that result in a divergence between fair betting odds and credence. Such manipulations are familiar from tools of finance. One can easily see that the Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> is structured {{in such a way}} as to result in a divergence between fair betting odds and credence. 2. The inspection of credences and betting odds in certain betting situations shows that the two main extant positions, Elga's and Lewis's, are both mistaken. 3. My proposal may seem to require a revision of probability theory but it does not. The Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> merely calls attention to a constraint on partitioning of possibility space that is usually satisfied as a matter of course but can in fact be violated...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{important}} sense in which an agent’s credences are universal: while they reflect an agent’s own judgments, those judgments apply equally to everyone’s bets. This point, while uncontentious, has been overlooked; people automatically assume that credences concern an agent’s own bets, perhaps {{just because of the}} name “subjective” that is typically applied to this account of belief. This oversight has had unfortunate consequences for recent epistemology, in particular concerning the Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> and its myriad variants...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} three {{accounts of}} the sleeping beauty case: an account proposed by Adam Elga, an account proposed by David Lewis, and a third account defended in this paper. It provides two reasons for preferring the third account. First, this account {{does a good job}} of capturing the temporal continuity of our beliefs, while the accounts favored by Elga and Lewis do not. Second, Elga’s and Lewis ’ treatments of the sleeping <b>beauty</b> <b>case</b> lead to highly counterintuitive consequences. The proposed account also leads to counterintuitive consequences, but theyre not as bad as those of Elga’s account, and no worse than those of Lewis’ account. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{standard}} Reflection Principle (van Fraassen, 1984) and the Group Reflection Principle (Elga, 2007; Bovens & Rabinowicz, 2011; Titelbaum, 2012; Hedden, 2015). I argue that these principles are incomplete as they stand. The key point is that deference is an intensional relation, and so whether you are rationally required to defer to a {{person at a time}} can depend on how that person and that time are designated. In this paper I suggest a way of completing the Reflection Principle and Group Reflection Principle, and I argue that so completed these principles are plausible. In particular, they do not fall foul of the Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case</b> (Elga, 2000), the Cable Guy Paradox (Hajek, 2005), Arntzenius' prisoner cases (Arntzenius, 2003), or the Puzzle of the Hats (Bovens & Rabinowicz, 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} cases {{involving}} self-locating beliefs have been discussed in the Bayesian literature. I suggest {{that many of these}} cases, such as the sleeping <b>beauty</b> <b>case,</b> are entangled with issues that are independent of self-locating beliefs per se. In light of this, I propose a division of labor: we should address each of these issues separately before we try to provide a comprehensive account of belief updating. By way of example, I sketch some ways of extending Bayesianism in order to accommodate these issues. Then, putting these other issues aside, I sketch some ways of extending Bayesianism in order to accommodate self-locating beliefs. Finally, I propose a constraint on updating rules, the "Learning Principle", which rules out certain kinds of troubling belief changes, and I use this principle to assess some of the available options...|$|E
40|$|All {{parties to}} the Sleeping Beauty debate agree that it shows that some {{cherished}} principle of rationality has to go. Thirders {{think that it is}} Conditionalization and Reflection that must be given up or modified; halfers think that it is the Principal Principle. I offer an analysis of the Sleeping Beauty puzzle that allows us to retain all three principles. In brief, I argue that Sleeping Beauty’s credence in the uncentered proposition that the coin came up heads should be 1 / 2, but her credence in the centered proposition that the coin came up heads and it is Monday should be 1 / 3. I trace the source of the earlier mistakes to an unquestioned assumption in the debate, namely that an uncentered proposition is just a special kind of centered proposition. I argue that the falsity of this assumption is the real lesson of the Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> <b>case...</b>|$|E

500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered many possible readings of American Beauty; film critics are similarly divided, {{not so much}} {{about the quality of the}} film, as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about [...] "the meaning of life" [...] or [...] "the hollow existence of the American suburbs", the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: [...] "a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories; it was about imprisonment, loneliness, [...] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad." [...] The literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: [...] " [...] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live." [...] He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who [...] " [...] all of the choices". He contends that in American <b>Beautys</b> <b>case,</b> it is neither Mendes nor Ball. Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was [...] "strongly influential" [...] on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. With [...] "innumerable voices intruding on the original author's," [...] Booth says, those who interpret American Beauty [...] "have forgotten to probe for the elusive center". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy [...] "that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting".|$|R

In Jamaica we find a process of inversion: the concept of race is maintained as a frame of societal analysis, but blackness is revalidated and has become a prerequisite for national and cultural belonging. In Indonesia racialized categorizations have disappeared almost completely as ‘race’ has become subjected to the development rhetoric, which just allows limited space for ethnic manifestations.

40|$|As the {{identity}} of the young is largely shaped through the feedback they receive from their peers the impression-management has become an essential part in the lives of young people, both in the real and in the virtual worlds. The aim of the paper is to analyse how young people present themselves on the photographs of dating and communication website Rate. Rate is known as a site where people can post a short description of themselves and photos, so that other users could give their points and comments. The purpose of my study was to analyse how the youngsters on the website formulate their gender identities in order to appeal to potential partners. Content analysis involving elements of visual analysis methods developed by Goffman (1979), Kress and van Leeuwen (1996), Kang (1997), and Bell (2001), was carried out to analyse the photos of youngsters who appeared in the TOP 100 of the most remarkable people in Rate in a period of six months. Altogether 139 women and 144 men from Rate where analysed to find out how is the gender identity reflected on the photographs. The results suggest that the photos of the most remarkable girls play with the stereotypical codes of sexuality presented by the media with the hope of meeting the social expectations of ideal female <b>beauty.</b> In <b>case</b> of boys, two contradictory types of masculinity tend to be most popular – the age-old Macho man and 21 century metrosexual.

Positive Exposure challenges pervasive social biases and stereotypes about genetic variation and strives to broaden and enrich societal perceptions of human beauty and spirit. Presented here are the open-ended personal reflections completed by four individuals with craniofacial differences recruited from a support group, Inner Faces. These four case studies aim to relay the professional photo-shoot experiences of peoplewhomaybe challengedby the stigmaassociatedwith craniofacial differences. Questions addressed issues of perceived self-esteem, stigma, hopefulness, and photography experiences.
