500|$|The New Zealanders {{travelled}} to New York City, {{where they}} played an exhibition game, {{then on to}} San Francisco. There they played two official matches against British Columbia, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited {{to speak at the}} reception, Gallaher said: [...] "We did not go behind our <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won. I have one recommendation to make to the New Zealand [...] Union, if it was to undertake such a tour again, and that is to play the Welsh matches first." ...|$|E

60|$|In conclusion, the sky clouded over, {{it became}} chilly, and a shower began to fall. Laura pursued Eveleen, and Amy hunted up Charlotte from the utmost {{parts of the}} field, where she was the very centre of 'winding up the clock,' and sorely against her will, dragged her off the wet grass. About sixty yards from the house, Guy met them with an umbrella, which, without speaking, he gave to Charlotte. Amy said, 'Thank you,' and again came that look. Charlotte rattled on, and hung <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Guy, so that Amy could not hasten on without leaving her shelterless. It may be {{believed}} {{that she had the}} conversation to herself. At the door they met Mary and her father, going to dismiss their flock, who had taken refuge in a cart-shed {{at the other end of}} the field. Guy asked if he could be of any use; Mr. Ross said no, and Mary begged Amy and Charlotte to go up to her room, and change their wet shoes.|$|E

I hear that his circumstances are well-nigh desperate. He has mortgaged the income of his estates, which, of course, he is unable to sell, as they go with the title to the heir. He is pressed by many creditors, who, now that he has lost the favour of the king, will give him no further grace. Indeed, I understand that the king, who is always liberal, and who not infrequently makes considerable gifts to the gentlemen of the court, to enable them to support the necessary expenses, has already assisted him several times, and that it was only by such aid that {{he has been able to}} hold on as long as he has done.|$|E

When she reached home and remembered her engagement, she was glad of it; and finding that she had still an hour before she could dress for dinner, she walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered into a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell, giving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and getting up a dramatic sense that her life was very busy. She paused on her way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to old Master Bunney who was putting in some garden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the crops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the result of sixty years' experience as to soils--namely, that if your soil was pretty mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make it all of a mummy, why then-- ...|$|E
