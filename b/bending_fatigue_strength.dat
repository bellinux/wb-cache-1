The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of {{successive}} TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding repairs on the reverse <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> of AISI 4130 steel, which is widely used in components critical to the flight-safety. In order to simulate the abrupt maneuvers, wind bursts, motor vibration and helixes efforts, which generate cyclic bending loadings at the welded joints of a specific aircraft component called "motor cradle", experimental reverse bending fatigue tests were carried out on specimens made from hot-rolled steel plate, 1. 10 mm (0. 043 in) thick, by mean of a SCHENK PWS equipment, with load ratio R =- 1, under constant amplitude, at 30 Hz frequency and room temperature.

40|$|Observations on some steels used in high {{performance}} gears {{are presented in}} this thesis. The object was to understand how microstructure and residual stress influenced mechanical properties, particularly <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength.</b> The investigations were carried out using fatigue testing, metallographic techniques, shot peening, hardness testing and Xray diffraction to determine residual stress {{and the amount of}} retained austenite. The work is divided into two main parts. In the first part, the opportunity was taken of investigating a batch of case-carburised gears manufactured from 17 CrNiMo 6 steel that contained an abnormally high level of retained austenite.. The benefits or otherwise of retained austenite is a matter of some controversy in the literature and this was an opportunity of testing the effect of high retained austenite in gears. In the second part, the properties of a recently formulated through hardening steel was investigated. The steel is inexpensive and capable of being fully hardened by air-cooling. It is believed that use of the material could reduce the cost of gear manufacture by eliminating the carburisation process, oil quenching and the subsequent need to correct distortions that arise from quenching. Gears were manufactured using l 7 CrNiMo 6 steel. After carburization, one batch was found to have an abnormally high level of retained austenite (40 to 60 %). Normally, gears with this level of retained austenite would be rejected. Nevertheless, gears from this batch were found to have surface and <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> that were not very different from those with much lower retained austenite contents. Despite the fact that the material is relatively soft, it was found that a very thin surface layer had hardened during back-to-back gear testing, probably by strain-induced transformation of the retained austenite. It was deduced that this thin layer of hardened material is sufficient to maintain a good level of surface contact <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength.</b> The second part of the work includes a basic study of the through-hardening steel. The study includes heat treatment and hardness, estimation of fracture toughness and the development of residual stress during heat treatment. Specialised standing contact fatigue (SCF) tests were also done using this material. The SCF test consists of cyclic loading of a hard ball in contact with the surface of the specimen, which is meant to simulate asperity contact in surface contact fatigue. Radial cracks or ring cracks or both are nucleated just outside the indentation circle in these tests, depending on the load and the development of plasticity. The stresses near the indentation were modelled using Finite Element analysis and were found to be consistent with the experimental results. Finally, the effect of residual compressive stress induced by shot peeing was studied using the SCF test. It was found that shot peening suppressed the formation of radial cracks.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thermochemical}} treatment namely carburising on the fatigue behaviour of one carbon and two alloy steels {{has been studied}} in rotating and unidirectional bending. The effect of carbon profile on the unidirect¬ional <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> of 63 SA 14 was assessed, and {{it was found that}} single stage carburising with a surface carbon content of 0. 8 % has resulted in a higher fatigue strength than other types of carbon profiles. Residual stresses and other metallurgical variables arising from different carbon profiles, were also considered. The highest compressive stresses h~e resulted from boost-diffuse-carburising. On the other hand surface decarburisation was associated with tensile residual stresses and a reduced fatigue strength. Retained austenite was found to be detrimental in unidirectional bending fatigue; however its presence in carburised 83 SAIS did not seem to influence the rotating <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength.</b> Carbide particles in globular and/or intergranular form were detrimental to compressive residual stresses; the unidirectional <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> is markedly lowered. The highest fatigue strength was accomplished by vacuum carburising. The absence of internal oxidation was the key factor in the increased fatigue strength; the presence of uniformly distributed fine carbide particles did not upset the superior fatigue strength of vacuum carburised pieces. The effect of mean stress on the fatigue strength of carburised 63 SA 14 was studied. Increasing the mean stress as would be expected resulted in a decreased fatigue strength. Carburisation showed its advantages at low mean stress, but at high mean stress it offers little advantage over the uncarburised hardened conditions. Notch effect was also studied in unidirectional bending of carburised 080 MlS. The general trend showed that the fatigue strength decreases with increasing the stress concentration factor.

Note high exposure in the case of two extreme points of stress and extreme positions and the derived extreme contact stress formula. Finally, a pair of conjugate gear tooth profile curvature provides specific contact stress calculation...|$|E

Alternative flexion <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests {{with a single}} change in stress amplitude are performed {{at room temperature for}} step-down sequence with two-step and threestep loading. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> of aluminum 7050 -T 7451 alloy under block loading is investigated through comparison between the remaining cycles and consumed cycles ratios. The experimental results from the blocks loading fatigue tests are compared with the predictions using Miner’ss rule. It is shown that, two-step the <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> is enhanced for smaller consumed fatigue loading and the cumulative fatigue damage calculated in accordance with the LDR, for three-step the <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> occurs to a higher number of consume fatigue loading and the LDR rule trend to underestimate the fatigue life and the accumulative damage becomes higher than unity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the <b>bending,</b> <b>fatigue,</b> tensile stresses and erosion-coiTosion characteristics o f HVOF thermally sprayed Inconel- 625 powder coatings when deposited on three different metallic surfaces: (a) plain stainless steel (SS), (b) spot-welded stainless steel (SW-SS), and (c) a composite surface o f stainless steel and carbon steel welded together (C-SS-CS) under three conditions: (i) surface as-coated, (ii) surface as-coated and subjected to aqueous static corrosion for two weeks, and (iii) surface as-coated and subjected to aqueous static corrosion for four weeks. The predictions of the residual stresses generated during the deposition of the coating over the different metallic surfaces were also performed using analytical and numerical model studies. Validation o f the models was earned out by comparing the results to experimental data. The surface morphology and the elemental composition of the coatings before and after each test were examined using SEM and EDS techniques. The results indicate that the presence of weld or having a composite substrate formed by two different materials does affect the residual stresses at the interface, as it lowers <b>bending,</b> tensile, <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> and enhancing corrosion effect, as observed by the analytical and experimental analyses carried out in this research. Microscopic obseivation of the fractured surfaces showed that the cracks were formed at the interface between the coating and substrate material as well as within the coating. Presence of non-melted particles in the coating enhanced crack propagation and erosion rates. The presence o f oxides, namely AI 2 O 3 at the interface between the coating and the substrate material left over from the surface preparation process also had an effect. Hence careful control is required when applying welds beneath surface coatings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWC- 12 Co was {{thermally}} sprayed on AZ 80 A magnesium (Mg) alloy as an interlayer, {{and then}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) film was deposited {{in order to}} fabricate DLC/WC- 12 Co hybrid coating. Rotary <b>bending</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests were conducted in laboratory air {{and the effect of}} hybrid coating on the fatigue behaviour was discussed. The thicknesses of WC- 12 Co interlayer were 15, 50 and 80  μm and those of DLC film were 3 and 15  μm. Thin hybrid coating (15  μm WC- 12 Co +  3  μm DLC) was detrimental to the <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> because thin coating could not suppress crack initiation from the small notches introduced during thermal spraying process. Thick hybrid coating (80  μm WC- 12 Co +  15  μm DLC), however, could improve <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength.</b> Thick interlayer was effective for bearing fatigue loading, resulting in the higher <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> than the substrate...|$|R
