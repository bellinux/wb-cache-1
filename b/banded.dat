Gymnothorax moray eels taken from the Caribbean, where the <b>banded</b> sea krait is not present, died after injection with doses as small as 0.1mg/kg body weight, but Gymnothorax individuals taken from New Guinea, where <b>banded</b> sea kraits are endemic, were able to tolerate doses as large as 75mg/kg without severe injury.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking <b>banded</b> sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during {{the early hours of the}} day. <b>Banded</b> sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, <b>banded</b> sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading <b>banded</b> sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E

5|$|When hunting, <b>banded</b> sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce. Individual <b>banded</b> sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry.

5|$|<b>Banded</b> sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the <b>banded</b> sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help <b>banded</b> sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a <b>banded</b> sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E

50|$|Brass <b>bands</b> {{were very}} popular {{throughout}} the United States {{in the late}} 19th century and {{the early decades of}} the 20th century. Well known <b>bands</b> of virtuoso musicians toured widely, and most towns had their own <b>bands</b> that put on weekend music concerts. One notable example of this was The Ohio State University Marching <b>Band</b> which formed in 1879 and still performs with only brass and percussion instruments. Other groups, ranging from benevolent societies to large factories, would often have a <b>band.</b> The brass <b>band</b> movement has undergone a resurgence in the late twentieth century, led by the North American Brass <b>Band</b> Association. The United States boasts a number of professional brass <b>bands,</b> including the Brass <b>Band</b> of Battle Creek, the River City Brass <b>Band,</b> and the Orchid City Brass <b>Band</b> (West Palm Beach, FL); community brass <b>bands</b> such as the Central Ohio Brass <b>Band,</b> Dublin Silver <b>Band,</b> Motor City Brass <b>Band,</b> Atlantic Brass <b>Band,</b> Brass of the Potomac, Chesapeake Silver Cornet Brass <b>Band</b> (Delaware), Five Lakes Silver <b>Band,</b> Allegheny Brass <b>Band,</b> The Brass <b>Band</b> of Central Florida, the Sheldon Theatre Brass <b>Band</b> (Red Wing, MN), the Lake Wobegon Brass <b>Band</b> (Anoka, MN), the Twin Cities Brass <b>Band</b> (Bloomington, MN), the Fountain City Brass <b>Band,</b> the Triangle Brass <b>Band,</b> the Smoky Mountain Brass <b>Band</b> and the River Brass; several collegiate brass <b>bands,</b> including the James Madison University Brass <b>Band,</b> the Mansfield University Brass <b>Band,</b> the Slippery Rock University Brass Ensemble and the University of Georgia British Brass Band; and various youth brass <b>bands,</b> including the Triangle Youth Brass <b>Band</b> and the Fountain City Youth Brass <b>Bands</b> also exist.|$|R

5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although the striped plumage of its two species suggests a distant relationship with streaked African Hirundo species.

The nearest relation of the two Phedina martins is the <b>banded</b> martin, Riparia cincta, which appears not to be closely related to the other members of its current genus and resembles Brazza's martin in its nesting habits and calls. The current Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC)-recommended practice is to move the <b>banded</b> martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta, rather than to merge it into Phedina, since the <b>banded</b> martin's larger size, different bill and nostril shape and non-colonial nesting are differences from the current Phedina species.|$|E

5|$|Although most <b>banded</b> sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that <b>banded</b> sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from <b>banded</b> sugar ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Banded</b> sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. <b>Banded</b> sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E
