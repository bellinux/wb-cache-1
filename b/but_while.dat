The band was {{scheduled}} to tour {{during the summer of}} 1994 with Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, Danzig, and Fight, as well as a slot during Woodstock '94, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> in rehearsal for the tour, Staley began using heroin again. Staley's condition prompted the other band members to cancel all scheduled dates one day {{before the start of the}} tour, putting the band on hiatus. Alice in Chains was replaced by Candlebox on the tour.|$|E

5|$|Both Ænima and 10,000 Days were {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for 10,000 Days that features a pair of stereoscopic lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 1970s artwork he appreciates.|$|E

5|$|Cole was an Australian Institute of Sport Scholarship holder. Her coach, Graeme Carroll, trained her in Canberra in {{preparation}} for the 2012 London Paralympics with an approach that combined swim training with aerobics and gym work. She trained with Teigan Van Roosmalen, a blind and deaf S13 swimmer. Cole also mentors young athletes. When not in high school Cole was undertaking ten or more swimming sessions a week <b>but,</b> <b>while</b> at school, she reduced her load. As of 2015, her coach is Nathan Doyle.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> {{some of his}} edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, they were not harsher than those of his predecessors. It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E
5|$|Different {{camouflage}} methods {{employed by}} terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic animals, and in military usage, are compared in the table. Several methods are often combined, so {{for example the}} Bushbuck is both countershaded over its whole body, and disruptively coloured with small pale spots. Until the discovery of countershading in the 1890s, protective coloration {{was considered to be}} mainly a matter of colour matching, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> this is certainly important, a variety of other methods are used to provide effective camouflage.|$|E

Such was the surprise around South Melbourne's loss, there were post-match rumours of South players being offered and accepting bribes to play poorly and Bob Pratt and Peter Reville angrily confronted team mates who underperformed.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 {{election}} {{he had some}} sympathy with Keynes's view <b>but</b> <b>while</b> campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{the onset of the}} first World War, four new ships were purchased: Bermagui, Bonandera, Bodalla and Bergalia. Bodalla was requisitioned for the war effort and {{repurposed}} as a minesweeper, and she was lost in 1924. After the war the company purchased another three vessels: Nergalia, Cobargo and Kianga. Two of these three boats, Nergalia and Kianga, were requisitioned during World War II, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> both survived the hostilities, Kianga was not returned to the company after being decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's principles, {{and both}} demonstrated {{a completely different}} chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) <b>But,</b> <b>while</b> Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{remained}} in England until 1148. The disorders {{were at their}} peak between 1142 and 1148, but her cause could never secure enough support to enable her to be crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. <b>But</b> <b>while</b> Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.|$|E

5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the horizon for the observer, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
