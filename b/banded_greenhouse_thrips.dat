40|$|The AvoGreen {{protocols}} {{for monitoring}} pests in avocado orchards {{are based on}} representative leaf and fruit samples obtained through sampling undertaken at ground level. During the 2001 - 2002 season research was begun to validate aspects of the sampling methodology involved. Initial studies focussed on the distribution within blocks of leafrollers and <b>greenhouse</b> <b>thrips.</b> Sampling was carried out on several orchards in summer and autumn in the Whangarei and Bay of Plenty regions. All trees in a block were sampled from the ground with 10 shoots or 5 fruit sites/tree inspected. Results showed that leafroller caterpillars and <b>greenhouse</b> <b>thrips</b> were evenly distributed throughout the sampled blocks. In further studies the vertical distribution of these pests on host trees was investigated by taking samples from three height strata for 10 trees in a block. At least 300 sites were sampled in each block. The {{results showed that the}} height of sampling did not generally influence the number of thrips or leafroller caterpillars found, confirming that monitoring at ground level does provide a representative sample...|$|R
40|$|Intraguild {{predation}} of Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans (Phytoseiidae) by soil-dwelling predators, Dalotia coriaria Kraatz (Staphylinidae) {{may limit}} {{the utility of}} open rearing systems in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>thrips</b> management programs. We determined the rate of D. coriaria invasion of N. cucumeris breeder material presented in piles or sachets, bran piles (without mites), and sawdust piles. We also observed mite dispersal from breeder piles and sachets when D. coriaria were not present. Dalotia coriaria invaded breeder and bran piles at higher rates than sawdust piles and sachets. Furthermore, proportions of N. cucumeris in sachets were six- to eight-fold higher compared with breeder piles. When D. coriaria were absent, N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles and sachets for up to seven weeks. In earlier weeks, more N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles compared with sachets, and in later weeks more N. cucumeris dispersed from sachets compared with breeder piles. Sachets protected N. cucumeris from intraguild predation by D. coriaria resulting in higher populations of mites. Therefore, sachets {{should be used in}} greenhouse biocontrol programs that also release D. coriaria. Furthermore, breeder piles that provide “quick-releases” or sachets that provide “slow-releases” of mites should be considered when incorporating N. cucumeris into <b>greenhouse</b> <b>thrips</b> management programs...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} insecticidal {{formulations}} were examined for their efficacy against {{a range of}} insects under laboratory conditions using a Potter Tower technique. The insecticides Yates Pyrethrum, Eco-oil, Defender, Orchex, Confidor, Agrimec, Encapsulated Pyrethrum, Encapsulated Pyrethrum and Neem, Azatin, NeemAzal, {{as well as a}} combination of the insecticides Azatin plus Eco-oil were tested at both the half as well as the full recommended field rate against a range of insect pests. In addition, the ability to synergise natural pyrethrum by {{some or all of the}} natural compounds including sesame oil, the crystalline extract of a sesame oil crude extract, dillapiole, and the synthetic synergist PBO, in spray emulsions at a variety of rates and ratios was examined in tests against the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, passionvine hopper (Scolypopa australis), <b>greenhouse</b> <b>thrip,</b> and lightbrown apple moth. Confidor and Yates Pyrethrum gave marked control (i. e. mortality > 80 %) of the greatest number of test species including the aphid, thrip and mealybug and two of the moth species for Confidor and all of the moth, aphid and thrip species for Yates Pyrethrum. It is suggested that the use of the synthetic synergist PBO could be replaced by the natural synergists including dillapiole, as well as the crystalline extract of a sesame oil crude extract at the highest ratio that was tested against the pea aphid, passionvine hopper, and lightbrown apple moth.

40|$|Thrips {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} pests to control in <b>greenhouses.</b> <b>Thrips</b> are tiny insects that reproduce rapidly, congregate in tight places that make pesticide coverage difficult, and feed with rasping-piercing-sucking mouth parts, resulting in deformation of flowers and leaves. Tolerance of thrips on floriculture crops is particularly low. In addition, when the Western flower thrips feed on plants infected with the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) or impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), the insect vectors these diseases to other plants in the greenhouse. Once plants are infected, it is too late to do anything except dispose of diseased plants. Thus, the best way to prevent virus infection is to control thrips...|$|R
40|$|<b>Greenhouse</b> <b>thrips</b> (Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis) {{is a major}} pest of horticultural crops worldwide, and in New Zealand it is {{particularly}} damaging on citrus, avocados and ornamentals. Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis development, oviposition and longevity were determined at five constant temperatures (6, 8, 20, 23 and 25 ºC) on unripe Yenben lemon fruit. Total developmental time (egg to adult) ranged from 72. 9 days at 6 ºC to 28. 4 days at 25 ºC. The rate of H. haemorrhoidalis oviposition was highest at 25 ºC, with an average of. 4 eggs laid per day. Mean adult longevity ranged from 89. 9 days at 25 ºC to 24 days at 6 ºC. It was estimated that 49. 8 degree-days, above a lower threshold temperature of 0. ºC, were required to complete development from egg to adult. The developmental time predictions obtained from the degree-day model were validated under variable field conditions. Actual developmental times were generally within one day of times predicted by the model...|$|R

40|$|The main pests of New Zealand {{avocados}} {{are several}} species of native leafrollers, and the exotic <b>greenhouse</b> <b>thrips</b> (Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis) (first recorded in 1930) and latania scale (Hemiberlesia lataniae) (first recorded in the 1960 ’s). The geographic isolation of New Zealand has helped to exclude many exotic pests of avocados present in other coun-tries. The most important pests of overseas fruit crops that could affect the economy of New Zealand avocados (and other fruit crops) are fruit flies. Two other key pests of avo-cado overseas which would have a serious impact on New Zealand avocado production are the avocado thrips (Scirtothrips perseae) and the persea mite (Olygonichus perseae). The biosecurity effort within New Zealand focuses on preventing the arrival of new pests. MAF Biosecurity is the government agency, which is charged with keeping pests out of New Zealand. It carries out border control activities, maintains quarantine and pest surveillance services, and {{has the authority to}} carry out emergency responses to eradicate any un-wanted organisms. Over the past few years, two major pest eradication exercises have been successfully carried out (Queensland fruit flies and the white spotted tussock moth).

5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of <b>greenhouse</b> agriculture, <b>thrips,</b> unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|R
40|$|Os pulgões e os tripes são importantes pragas em cultivo de crisântemo em casas de vegetação. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a ocorrência e flutuação populacional de tripes, pulgões e inimigos naturais em {{cultivar}}es de crisântemo de corte ('White Reagan', 'Yellow Snowdon' e 'Sunny Reagan') em casa de vegetação comercial. A amostragem de tripes foi realizada através de batidas nas plantas ("tapping method") e a de pulgões a partir de coletas diretas nas plantas. Das espécies de tripes amostradas, mais de 90 % foram identificadas como Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), e o restante incluíram F. gemina (Bagnall), Frankliniella sp., Caliothrips phaseoli (Hood) e Haplothrips gowdeyi (Franklin). Foi observado maior número de tripes/planta no cultivar White Reagan se comparado com 'Yellow Snowdon'. Aphis gossypii Glover foi a espécie de pulgão mais comum (> 80 %), sendo também coletados Myzus persicae (Sulzer) e Dysaphis sp. Maior número de pulgões foi verificado na cultivar White Reagan, quando comparada com 'Sunny Reagan'. Orius insidiosus (Say) foi o único predador encontrado associado aos tripes, sendo verificada uma correlação positiva significativa entre a população de tripes e a desse predador. Dentre os inimigos naturais relacionados aos pulgões, foram observados parasitóides (Aphidius colemani Viereck e Lysiphlebus testaceipes Cresson) e predadores (Chrysoperla sp., Cycloneda sanguinea Linnaeus e Scymnus sp.). Houve uma correlação positiva significativa entre o crescimento populacional de pulgões e desses predadores e parasitóides nas cultivares White Reagan e Sunny Reagan. Inimigos naturais podem ocorrer naturalmente em casas de vegetação e influenciar as populações de pragas. Aphids and thrips play {{an important}} role on chrysanthemum crops in greenhouses. The objective of this work was to evaluate the occurrence and population densities of thrips, aphids and natural enemies in cut chrysanthemum cultivars ('White Reagan', 'Yellow Snowdon' and 'Sunny Reagan') in commercial <b>greenhouse.</b> <b>Thrips</b> sampling was made by the tapping method, while aphids were sampled by direct counting on the plants. Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (> 90 %), F. gemina, Frankliniella sp., Caliothrips phaseoli (Hood) and Haplothrips gowdeyi (Franklin) were the thrips species found. A higher number of thrips/plant was found in 'White Reagan' compared with 'Yellow Snowdon' cultivar. The aphid species Aphis gossypii (Glover) (> 80 %), Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Dysaphis sp. were found. A higher number of aphids were found in 'White Reagan' than in 'Sunny Reagan' cultivar. The predatory bug Orius insidiosus (Say) was the only species found associated with thrips in all chrysanthemum cultivars. A positive correlation between thrips and O. insidiosus populations was found. Among the natural enemies associated with aphids the parasitoids Aphidius colemani Viereck and Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson), and the predators Chrysoperla sp., Cycloneda sanguinea (L.) and Scymnus sp were collected. A positive correlation between aphids and their natural enemies' populations in 'White Reagan' and 'Sunny Reagan' cultivars was found. Natural enemies can naturally occur on chrysanthemum in greenhouse and they can affect the pest population...|$|R
40|$|Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) {{is a key}} pest {{of various}} crops worldwide. In this study, we analyse the {{dependence}} of the infestation of this pest on spatially distributed micro climatic factors in a rose greenhouse. Despite {{the importance of this}} subject, the few existing studies have been realized in laboratory rather than in greenhouse conditions. However, recent progress on greenhouse microclimate characterisation has highlighted the strong indoor climate heterogeneity that may influence the within-crop pest distribution. In this study, both microclimate (air temperature and humidity) and thrips distribution were simultaneously mapped in a rose greenhouse. The measurements were sensed in a horizontal plane situated at mid-height of the rose crop inside the <b>greenhouse.</b> Simultaneously, <b>thrips</b> population dynamics were assessed after an artificial and homogeneous infestation of the rose crop. The spatio-temporal distribution of climate and <b>thrips</b> within the <b>greenhouse</b> were compared, and links between thrips infestation and climatic conditions were investigated. A statistical model was used to define the favourable climate conditions for thrips adults and larvae. Our results showed that (i) the air temperature and air humidity were very heterogeneously distributed within the crop, (ii) pest populations aggregated in the most favourable climatic areas and (iii) the highest population density of thrips adults and larvae were recorded at 27 °C and 22 °C for temperature and 63 % and 86 % for humidity, respectively. These findings confirm, in real rose cropping conditions, previous laboratory studies on the F. occidentalis climatic optimum and provide a solid scientific support for climatic-based control methods against this pest...|$|R

40|$|The continual {{detection}} of a slow (I 1) esterase <b>band</b> in <b>greenhouse</b> cultures of Meloidogyne konaensis {{isolated from the}} field led to a hypothesis that the nematode may be polymorphic for esterase. A survey of coffee fields demonstrated at least four esterase phenotypes were present in Meloidogyne recovered. An F 1 phenotype predominated (60 % of the females), but an I 1 phenotype was also common (30 % of samples). A series of greenhouse and laboratory experiments were undertaken to understand this polymorphism. Esterase phenotype was not affected by development at 22 º, 25 º, or 33 ºC on tomato. Two different esterase phenotypes (I 1 and F 1 -I 1) were detected after M. konaensis was grown on tomato for several generations, even in single-egg-mass lines derived from an F 1 female. Three isolates of M. konaensis differing in esterase phenotype (F 1, I 1, and F 1 -I 1) did not differ morphologically but did differ in their parasitic ability. Only the F 1 isolate parasitized Coffea arabica. The F 1 -I 1 isolate had greater reproduction on Lycopersicon esculentum and Cucumis sativus than either the I 1 or F 1 isolate. The mechanism {{of the development of}} the polymorphism has yet to be determined.

Activated carbon was applied at 0, 150 and 300 pounds per acre, broadcast basis, while diuron, linuron, fluometuron and metobromuron were applied at rates of 1. 0 and 2. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0, 1. 0 and 2. 0, and 1. 0 and 2. 0 lbs /acre, respectively. The results obtained showed that when activated carbon was used as a band treatment of one inch over the row (broadcast basis) at a rate of 150 pounds per acre, prior to herbicide application, good crop protection was obtained for all herbicide treatments at all rates. However, the activated carbon also protected that weeds that germinated under the carbon <b>band.</b> In the <b>greenhouse,</b> the influence of band width was determined by applying 0, 150 and 300 pounds per acre of carbon in bands of 1. 0 and 3. 0 inches in width. A carbon band of 1. 0 inch provided adequate protection to the beans for all rates tested. No injury was observed in either the roots or the shoots, for all rates tested. The effectiveness of activated carbon in protecting four plant species, beans, ryegrass (Lolium perenne Var. Linn L.), pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L) Beauv) from diuron injury was also determined in a greenhouse experiment. It was found that activated carbon to diuron ratios of 100 : 1 were effective in protecting the four species tested. Experiments with 2 -gram "packets" of vermiculite with carbon showed that beans were protected from diuron injury only when the packet contained carbon. Application of activated carbon mixed in with a vermiculite "packet" was as effective as applying the carbon in a one-inch band over the row. In an experiment involving alternate wetting and drying of activated carbon no decrease of the adsorptive capacity of the carbon was observed. In the laboratory the adsorption of diuron at 7, 10 and 20 ppm by four commercial types of activated carbon (Aqua Nuchar A, Darco-M, Gro-Safe and Pittsburg No. 3) was determined. The results indicated that differences exist between different carbon sources. The greater the surface area of the carbon, the greater its adsorptivity. Desorption studies with diuron at 20 ppm and four different activated carbon sources showed that the degree of desorption also varied between the carbon sources...|$|R
