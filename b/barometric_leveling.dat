30|$|Figure  1 c {{shows the}} {{differences}} at the common gravity {{sites in the}} 2013 survey (this paper) and the 1994 survey (Leroy 1994). The gravity differences (gravity values in 2013 relative to those in 1994) range from 3 to 35  mGal, with a mean value of 17.6  mGal. The 2013 and 1994 gravity values are based on two different gravity datums: the datum implied by the new FG 5 absolute gravity (for 2013; see Table  1), and the datum implied by the International Gravity Standardization Network 1971 (IGSN 71; Morelli et al. 1974). Ihde (1993) also found a difference of 14  mGal between the absolute gravity value and the gravity value from IGSN 71 at gravity site Potsdam A. In addition, the elevations of the gravity sites in the 1994 survey were determined by <b>barometric</b> <b>leveling,</b> so that the uncertainties of such elevations will probably increase with elevations. The differences between the gravity values in the 2013 and 1994 surveys were most likely caused by both gravity datum difference and elevation error. Despite the differences, the patterns of gravity variations along the two major profiles are similar (Fig.  1 a, b).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{application}} of the least squares adjustment techniques {{to the area of}} surveying has been considered and two computer programs called HCONTRL and VCONTRL are developed for horizontal and vertical control respectively. The principle of least squares is discussed in chapter II. The observation and condition equations are compared and the observation equations technique is applied in the programs. The general forms of the observation equations for distance and angle (or direction) are derived in chapter III. The solution and the precision of the solution from the least squares adjustment technique are also discussed. A brief discussions on future systems; the satellite positioning, the inertial positioning, and the non-classical method, are included in chapter III. In chapter IV, the development and the procedures to be used in using the computer program HCONTRL are discussed. The least squares application to the various techniques of the horizontal position control; traverse, intersection, resection, triangulation, trilateration, and combined networks, are described in chapter V. The theory of vertical position control is discussed in chapter VI where techniques of direct leveling and trig leveling are described. This chapter also includes a brief description on; gravimetric leveling, <b>barometric</b> <b>leveling,</b> hydrostatic leveling, tacheometric leveling, satellite altimetry, and steric leveling. The development and procedures of the computer program VCONTRL, to adjust the direct leveling and the trig leveling by the least squares technique are discussed in chapter VII. The {{application of}} the least squares to the direct leveling and the trig leveling is given in chapter VIII. In chapter IX, practicality of the least squares adjustment is considered. The summary and conclusions are in chapter X. Appendix I consists of the numerical examples of the least squares adjustment of the various techniques in the horizontal position control by the computer program HCONTRL. The numerical examples of direct leveling and trig leveling by the computer program VCONTRL are given in Appendix II. A numerical example of the gravimetric leveling computation to find the geopotential numbers is also presented in Appendix II. Appendix III contains the complete listings of the computer programs HCONTRL and VCONTRL...|$|E
