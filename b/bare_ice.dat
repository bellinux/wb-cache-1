40|$|Today we {{experience}} an accelerated melting of sea {{ice in the}} Arctic which global circulation models are inadequate to predict. We believe {{one of the reasons}} is the shortcomings in the sea ice albedo schemes for these models. This paper investigates a physically based sea ice albedo scheme for ECHAM 5 GCM, which separates between snow-covered sea <b>ice,</b> <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice,</b> melt ponds, and open water (separately for the albedos and albedo fractions). The new albedo scheme includes important components such as albedo decay due to snow aging, <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice</b> albedo dependent on the ice thickness, and a melt pond albedo dependent on the melt pond depth. The explicit treatment of melt pond albedos has, to our knowledge, not been included in general circulation models before and represents a substantial improvement when simulating the annual cycle of sea ice albedo. The new albedo scheme overall reduces the sea ice albedo both in winter, because of snow aging, and in summer, because of melt ponds. The reduced sea ice albedo leads to overall reduced sea ice thickness, concentration, and volume, with large temporal and spatial variations. In the Northern Hemisphere in March, some areas experience increased albedo, resulting in thicker sea ice and higher ice concentration, but in August the pattern is spatially homogeneous, with reduced albedo, thickness, and concentrations for all areas where the new scheme has a significant effect.

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions <b>bare</b> of <b>ice.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Snowball Earth bifurcation, or runaway ice-albedo feedback, {{is defined}} for {{particular}} boundary conditions by a critical CO 2 and a critical sea-ice cover (SI), {{both of which}} are essential for evaluating hypotheses related to Neoproterozoic glaciations. Previous work has shown that the Snowball Earth bifurcation, denoted as (CO 2 , SI) *, differs greatly among climate models. Here, we revisit the initiation of a Snowball Earth in the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM for Marinoan (~ 630 Ma) continents and solar insolation decreased to 94 %. In its standard setup, ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM initiates a Snowball Earth much more easily than other climate models at (CO 2 , SI) * ≈ (500 ppm, 55 %). Previous work has shown that the Snowball Earth bifurcation can be pushed equatorward if a low <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice</b> albedo is assumed because <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice</b> is exposed by net evaporation in the descent region of the Hadley circulation. Consistent with this, when we replace the model's standard bare sea-ice albedo of 0. 75 by a much lower value of 0. 45, we find (CO 2 , SI) * ≈ (204 ppm, 70 %). When we additionally disable sea-ice dynamics, we find that the Snowball Earth bifurcation can be pushed even closer to the equator and occurs at a much lower CO 2 : (CO 2 , SI) * ≈ (2 ppm, 85 %). Therefore, both lowering the bare sea-ice albedo and disabling sea-ice dynamics increase the critical sea-ice cover in ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM, but sea-ice dynamics have a much larger influence on the critical CO 2 . For disabled sea-ice dynamics, the state with 85 % sea-ice cover is stabilized by the Jormungand mechanism and shares characteristics with the Jormungand climate states. However, there is no Jormungand bifurcation between this Jormungand-like state and states with mid-latitude sea-ice margins. Our results indicate that differences in sea-ice dynamics schemes can be as important as sea ice albedo for causing the spread in climate model's estimates of the location of the Snowball Earth bifurcation...|$|R

High frequency vibration creates stresses in the cable and consequently in the ice covering that cable, which may result in ice failure and eventually ice shedding. These stresses were estimated in this study. Displacement of the cable during vibration was determined; furthermore, instantaneous wind loads in vertical and transverse directions, additional stresses induced by the motion in the cable and in the atmospheric ice, as well as torque due to cable springback were calculated. In order to simulate the loading conditions of a chunk of atmospheric ice {{in the middle of}} a span, a new model was developed using ABAQUS. Results from this model show in spite of high frequency vibration, the resulting level of stress in atmospheric ice is far less than its failure limit.

40|$|Snow is a {{principal}} factor in controlling heat and light fluxes through sea ice. With the goal of improving radiative and heat flux estimates through sea ice in regional and global models without the need of detailed snow property descriptions, a new parameterization including subgrid-scale snow thickness variability is presented. One-parameter snow thickness distributions depending only on the gridbox-mean snow thickness are introduced resulting in analytical solutions for the fluxes of heat and light through the snow layer. As the snowpack melts, these snow thickness distributions ensure a smooth seasonal transition of the light field under sea ice. Spatially homogenous melting applied to an inhomogeneous distribution of snow thicknesses allows the appearance of <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice</b> areas and melt ponds before all snow has melted. In comparison to uniform-thickness snow used in previous models, the bias in the under sea-ice light field is halved with this parameterization. Model results from a one-dimensional ocean turbulence model coupled with a thermodynamic sea ice model are compared to observations near Resolute in the Canadian High Arctic. The simulations show substantial improvements {{not only to the}} light field at the sea ice base which will affect ice algal growth but also to the sea ice and seasonal snowpack evolution. During melting periods, the snowpack can survive longer while sea ice thickness starts to reduce earlier. © 2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-We {{developed}} an tiltra-wideband radar operating over frequencies from 500 MHz to 18 Ghz {{and used it}} {{in conjunction with a}} plane-wave illuminator to perform radar backscatter measurements over pancake, bare and snowcovered saline ice. The ice was grown in an outdoor pond at the U. S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, Hanover, NH. Data were acquired over incidence angles from 0 ° to 50 ° with VV and HH polarizations. Data were also collected on surface roughness, snow properties and ice structure. The combination of wide bandwidth and p!ane-wave illumination allowed us uniquely to identi ~ returns from airsnow and snow-ice interfaces. Returns from the snow-ice interface were about 10 dB higher than those from the snowair interface. At 0 ° incidence scattering horn <b>bare</b> saline <b>ice</b> varied little with frequency over the frequency range from 5 to 18 GHL whereas scattering from pancake ice increased from about 16 dB at 5 GHz to 27 dB at 18 GHz. In contrast scattering from snow-covered ice decreased by about 10 dB over the same frequency range. For both bare and snowcovered saline ice, the scattering coefficient decreased by more than 40 dB with over the angular region from 0 ° and 30 °, The rapid decay of the scattering coefficient is indicative of the presence of a coherent component near vertical and of the dominance of surface scattering over this angular region.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the use of}} synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry (Pol-SAR) and a supervised classification technique, support vector machine (SVM), for the classification of <b>bare</b> soil, <b>ice,</b> and snow, over the Ortles–Cevedale massif, (Eastern Italian Alps). We analyzed the importance of topographic correction on the backscattering and polarimetric SAR signature and the advantage of quad-pol with respect to dual-pol data. When backscattering values only are employed, the incidence angle used as input feature of the SVM classifier assures the best classification accuracy, 9. 9 % higher than the accuracy obtained with cosine corrected γ 0 backscattering. The introduction of polarimetric features and decomposition parameters (such as Cloude–Pottier or Touzi decomposition parameters) increases the classification accuracy by 5. 2 % {{with respect to the}} backscattering case. The simulation of RADARSAT- 2 data as Sentinel- 1 like for dual-pol data shows a decrease of accuracy equal to 7. 8 % with respect to the fully polarimetric case (93. 5 %).

We then tested the capability of C-band SAR to detect accumulation and ablation zones of the glaciers under the winter dry snow by setting up a multi-incidence angle and fully polarimetric SVM classifier, exploiting ascending and descending RADARSAT- 2 data. In this case, the accuracy increased by 14. 7 % combining different geometric acquisitions (88. 9 %) with respect to the single geometry case.

40|$|The {{microwave}} interferometric radiometer of the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission measures at {{a frequency}} of 1. 4 GHz in the L-band. In contrast to other microwave satellites, low frequency measurements in L-band {{have a large}} penetration depth in sea ice and thus contain information on the ice thickness. Previous ice thickness retrievals have neglected a snow layer {{on top of the}} ice. Here, we implement a snow layer in our emission model and investigate how snow influences L-band brightness temperatures and whether it is possible to retrieve snow thickness over thick Arctic sea ice from SMOS data. We find that the brightness temperatures above snow-covered sea ice are higher than above <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice</b> and that horizontal polarisation is more affected by the snow layer than vertical polarisation. In accordance with our theoretical investigations, the root mean square deviation between simulated and observed horizontally polarised brightness temperatures decreases from 20. 0 K to 4. 4 K, when we include the snow layer in the simulations. Under cold Arctic conditions we find brightness temperatures to increase with increasing snow thickness. Because dry snow is almost transparent in L-band, this brightness temperature's dependence on snow thickness origins from the thermal insulation of snow and its dependence on the snow layer thickness. This temperature effect allows us to retrieve snow thickness over thick sea ice. For the best simulation scenario and snow thicknesses up to 35 cm, the average snow thickness retrieved from horizontally polarised SMOS brightness temperatures agrees within 0. 7 cm with the average snow thickness measured during the IceBridge flight campaign in the Arctic in spring 2012.

These data are processed using version 3. 55 of the AIRSAR processor which provides radiometrically and polarimetrically calibrated images. The internal calibration of the AIRSAR data is cross-checked using the radar response from corner reflectors deployed prior to flight {{in one of}} the scenes. In addition, a quantitative assessment of the noise power level at various frequencies and polarizations is made in all the scenes. Synoptic SAR data corresponding to a swath width of about 12 by 50 km in length (compared to the standard 12 x 12 km size of high-resolution scenes) are also processed and calibrated to study transitions in radar backscatter as a function of snow facies at selected frequencies and polarizations. The snow facies on the Greenland ice sheet are traditionally categorized based on differences in melting regime during the summer months. The interior of Greenland corresponds to the dry snow zone where terrain elevation is the highest and no snow melt occurs. The lowest elevation boundary of the dry snow zone is known traditionally as the dry snow line. Beneath it is the percolation zone where melting occurs in the summer and water percolates through the snow freezing at depth to form massive ice lenses and ice pipes. At the downslope margin of this zone is the wet snow line. Below it, the wet snow zone corresponds to the lowest elevations where snow remains {{at the end of the}} summer.

40|$|Dust bands on blue ice {{fields in}} Antarctica {{have been studied}} and have been {{identified}} to originate from two main sources: bedrock debris scraped {{up from the ground}} by the glacial movement (these bands are found predominantly at fractures and shear zones in the ice near moraines), and volcanic debris deposited on and incorporated in the ice by large-scale eruptions of Antarctic (or sub-Antractic) volcanoes. Ice core studies have revealed that most of the dust layers in the ice cores are volcanic (tephra) deposits which may be related to some specific volcanic eruptions. These eruptions have to be related to some specific volcanic eruptions. These eruptions have to be relatively recent (a few thousand years old) since ice cores usually incorporate younger ice. In contrast, dust bands on <b>bare</b> blue <b>ice</b> fields are much older, up to a few hundred thousand years, which may be inferred from the rather high terrestrial age of meteorites found on the ice and from dating the ice using the uranium series method. Also for the volcanic ash layers found on blue ice fields correlations between some specific volcanoes (late Cenozoic) and the volcanic debris have been inferred, mainly using chemical arguments. During a recent field expedition samples of several dust bands found on blue ice fields at the Lewis Cliff Ice Tongue were taken. These dust band samples were divided for age determination using the uranium series method, and chemical investigations to determine the source and origin of the dust bands. The investigations have shown that most of the dust bands found at the Ice Tongue are of volcanic origin and, for chemical and petrological reasons, may be correlated with Cenozoic volcanoes in the Melbourne volcanic province, Northern Victoria Land, which is at least 1500 km away. Major and trace element data have been obtained and have been used for identification and correlation purposes.

The July monthly mean of the extent of <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> showed a positive trend over these 15 years, and large annual variability ranging from 89, 975 km 2 to 279, 075 km 2, 5 % and 16 % of the entire ice sheet, respectively.

40|$|The {{response}} of the albedo of <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice</b> and snow-covered sea ice to the addition of black carbon is calculated. Visible light absorption and light-scattering cross-sections are derived for a typical first-year and multi-year sea ice with both "dry" and "wet" snow types. The cross-sections are derived using data from a 1970 s field study that recorded both reflectivity and light penetration in Arctic sea ice and snow overlying sea ice. The variation of absorption cross-section over the visible wavelengths suggests black carbon is the dominating light-absorbing impurity. The {{response of}} first-year and multi-year sea ice albedo to increasing black carbon, from 1 to 1024 ng g − 1, in a top 5 cm layer of a 155 cm-thick sea ice was calculated using a radiative-transfer model. The albedo of the first-year sea ice is more sensitive to additional loadings of black carbon than the multi-year sea ice. An addition of 8 ng g − 1 of black carbon causes a decrease to 98. 7 % of the original albedo for first-year sea ice compared to a decrease to 99. 7 % for the albedo of multi-year sea ice, at a wavelength of 500 nm. The albedo of sea ice is surprisingly unresponsive to additional black carbon up to 100 ng g − 1. Snow layers on sea ice may mitigate the effects of black carbon in sea ice. Wet and dry snow layers of 0. 5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 cm depth were added onto the sea ice surface. The albedo of the snow surface was calculated whilst the black carbon in the underlying sea ice was increased. A layer of snow 0. 5 cm thick greatly diminishes the effect of black carbon in sea ice on the surface albedo. The albedo of a 2 – 5 cm snow layer (less than the e -folding depth of snow) is still influenced by the underlying sea ice, but the effect of additional black carbon in the sea ice is masked...|$|R

This paper will discuss {{the application of the}} SAR, optical and altimetry data in Grove Mountains. Firstly, the improved DEM is generated. It is still difficult to get the accurate DEM of the whole Grove Mountains which is about 8000 kilometers square because the sloping terrain and the baseline error exist. Based on the InSAR DEM and ICESat footprints, the high precision DEM of the whole area can be obtained. Secondly, the distribution of blue ice is obtained both in optical image and coherence map. Based on the different spectrum characteristics of snow, blue <b>ice</b> and <b>bared</b> rocks, blue <b>ice</b> can be extracted in the optical image. And because of the higher coherence of the blue ice than snow and mountains area, it can also be identified easily in the coherence map derived from the ERS- 1 / 2 tandem SAR data. Finally, crevasse detection is studied base on SAR image, optical image and coherence map. Based on the texture characteristics, gray level co-occurrence matrix and Gabor filter are chosen to recognize the crevasse. Basing on the study of Grove Mountains, more new technologies and satellite data shall be adopted to detect the ice surface change, ice flow velocity, etc, which are signal to the global environment change. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{wintering}} party (November 14, 1999 -March 28, 2001) of the 41 st Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 41) {{conducted a}} meteorite search in the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> field around the Yamato Mountains. The {{period of the}} travel was 89 days. Departure from Syowa Station was on October 27, 2000,entrance into the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> field on November 17, 2000,leaving the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> field on January 10, 2001,and arrival at Syowa Station on January 23, 2001. The 6 men party (field leader : Y. Shimoda, and sub-leader : N. Imae) of JARE- 41 collected about 3500 meteorites. The total sample weight was about 196 kg. The average meteorite weight was 55 g. The most frequent weight was in the bin of 3. 2 - 10 g of the weight histogram. The heaviest meteorite collected on the present expedition was an iron meteorite of 50. 5 kg. This is also the heaviest meteorite among the Yamato <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> region since the first expedition in 1969 (JARE- 10). The iron meteorite {{was found on the}} northwest region of JARE IV Nunataks. Compared with other areas, relatively large meteorites were found here. The number of meteorites on the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> region around Minami-Yamato Nunataks, which is the most famous meteorite concentration area, was large but the weight of each meteorite was lighter compared with other areas. Sublimation rate, which must {{be one of the most}} important factors for the concentration of meteorites, was measured at the near YM 175 (71 ° 44. 4 ′S, 35 ° 54. 7 ′E, 2138 m) using two independent methods. Both the stake method and the empirical formula method gave nearly comparable values in average; 50 - 80 and 130. 8 mg cm^ d^, respectively, which are larger than that at Mizuho Station. Sublimation using the stake method was measured at 8 points. Precise GPS measurements for 20 days at YM 175 showed that the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> is moving 3 cm to the west and 2 cm upward. This suggests that the upward movement is nearly balanced with the sublimation of ice. However, in order to consider the annual balance, longer measurements are needed...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> {{area of the}} Yamato Mountains about 4000 {{pieces of}} {{meteorite}} were found by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE). The most plausible explanation of the mechanism of meteorite concentration in the area was presented by NAGATA. In order to survey the bedrock topography in the <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> area airborne radio echo sounding {{was carried out in}} January 1980. The new sounder (NIPR-A) was operated at 179 MHz and mounted in a Pilatus Poter PC- 6. The peak power of the sounder was approximately 1 kW and the pulse width was 0. 3 μs. The line of the survey consisted of 5 parts, each being 80 km long. Two of them were parallel to the north-south direction and three were parallel to the east-west direction. Their interval was about 30 km. In this paper, the result of the survey on the topography of the bedrock and the surface is reported and especially the ice flow near Motoi Nunatak where the flow velocity and the ablation rate of ice were measured is commented. The <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> area where a lot of meteorites were found is a flat surface area upstream of subsurface mountains...|$|E
40|$|Analyses {{of remote}} sensing data, surface {{observations}} and output from a regional atmosphere model point to new records in 2010 for surface melt and albedo, runoff, {{the number of}} days when <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> is exposed and surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, especially over its west and southwest regions. Early melt onset in spring, triggered by above-normal near-surface air temperatures, contributed to accelerated snowpack metamorphism and premature <b>bare</b> <b>ice</b> exposure, rapidly reducing the surface albedo. Warm conditions persisted through summer, with the positive albedo feedback mechanism being a major contributor to large negative surface mass balance anomalies. Summer snowfall was below average. This helped to maintain low albedo through the 2010 melting season, which also lasted longer than usual. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Melt ponds are {{the most}} {{distinctive}} summertime feature of Arctic sea ice. Pond-covered sea ice preferentially absorbs short-wave solar radiation and this explains why the melt rate beneath melt ponds is 2 - 3 times that of <b>bare</b> sea <b>ice.</b> Melt ponds influence salinity variation of sea ice and can drain, releasing relatively fresh water into the upper layers of the ocean. Fresh melt water draining through sea ice {{can lead to the}} formation of under-ice melt ponds. For these reasons melt ponds are an important element of the Arctic climate system and attract our attention as an important subject for investigation. Modeling the evolution of melt ponds as the main process associated with significant changes in albedo, is currently one of the possible improvement of accuracy of climate models and thus the quality of predictions. The aim of this work is to improve parameterizations of the formation and summertime evolution of melt ponds on sea ice. As a result of this research work the following tasks solved: a new parameterization for the sea ice melting modules of the thermodynamic model of sea-ice (AARI), the calculation of the sea ice evolution and heat balance of the surface in the presence of melt ponds with the help of Mathematica and comparing the results of numerical calculations with the results of the model NAOSIM developed at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI, Bremerhaven, Germany). Comparing the results of three models, the following conclusions can be drawn: • Significant difference in the values of ice thickness in two models show us that the results of models are sensitive to the parameterization melting layer on the surface of ice cover in summer. At the same time due to lack of field observations it is impossible to decide which model gives more accurate results; • Short-wave radiation and temperature obtained with the use of melt pond depthdepended albedo parameterization demonstrate the importance of this kind of parameterization. Hence there is a necessity of different mathematical schemes for solving the system of differential equations; It is necessary to derive the parameterization of the drainage rate depending on such characteristics of ice, such as the height above sea level (hydrostatic pressure), the permeability or thickness of ice, or reflect the change of the rate as melt progresses...|$|R
40|$|Meltwater {{runoff from}} the Greenland ice sheet surface {{influences}} surface mass balance (SMB), ice dynamics, and global sea level rise, but is estimated with climate models and thus difficult to validate. We present {{a way to}} measure ice surface runoff directly, from hourly in situ supraglacial river discharge measurements and simultaneous high-resolution satellite/drone remote sensing of upstream fluvial catchment area. A first 72 -h trial for a 63. 1 -km 2 moulin-terminating internally drained catchment (IDC) on Greenland?s midelevation (1, 207 ? 1, 381 m above sea level) ablation zone is compared with melt and runoff simulations from HIRHAM 5, MAR 3. 6, RACMO 2. 3, MERRA- 2, and SEB climate/SMB models. Current models cannot reproduce peak discharges or timing of runoff entering moulins but are improved using synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH) theory. Retroactive SUH applications to two older field studies reproduce their findings, signifying that remotely sensed IDC area, shape, and supraglacial river length are useful for predicting delays in peak runoff delivery to moulins. Applying SUH to HIRHAM 5, MAR 3. 6, and RACMO 2. 3 gridded melt products for 799 surrounding IDCs suggests their terminal moulins receive lower peak discharges, less diurnal variability, and asynchronous runoff timing relative to climate/SMB model output alone. Conversely, large IDCs produce high moulin discharges, even at high elevations where melt rates are low. During this particular field experiment, models overestimated runoff by + 21 to + 58 %, linked to overestimated surface ablation and possible meltwater retention in <b>bare,</b> porous, low-density <b>ice.</b> Direct measurements of ice surface runoff will improve climate/SMB models, and incorporating remotely sensed IDCs will aid coupling of SMB with ice dynamics and subglacial systemspublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Cirrus cloud {{formation}} {{is believed to}} be domi-nated by homogeneous freezing of supercooled liquid aerosols in many instances. Heterogeneous ice nuclei such as mineral dust, metallic, and soot particles, and some crystalline solids within partially soluble aerosols are suspected to modulate cirrus properties. Among those, the role of ubiqui-tous soot particles is perhaps the least understood. Because aviation is a major source of upper tropospheric soot particles, we put emphasis on ice formation in dispersing aircraft plumes. The effect of aircraft soot on cirrus formation in the absence of contrails is highly complex and depends on a wide array of emission and environmental parameters. We use a microphysical-chemical model predicting the formation of internally mixed, soot-containing particles up to two days after emission, and suggest two principal scenarios, both assuming soot particles to be moderate ice nuclei relative to cirrus formation by homogeneous freezing in the presence of few efficient dust ice nuclei: high concentrations of original soot emissions could slightly increase the number of ice crystals; low concentrations of particles originating from coagulation of emitted soot with background aerosols could lead to a significant reduction in ice crystal number. A critical discussion of laboratory experiments reveals that the ice nucleation efficiency of soot particles depends strongly on their source, and, by inference, on atmospheric aging processes. Mass and chemistry of soluble surface coatings appear to be crucial factors. Immersed soot particles tend to be poor <b>ice</b> nuclei, some <b>bare</b> ones nucleate <b>ice</b> at low supersaturations. However, a fundamental understanding of these studies is lacking, rendering extrapolations to atmospheric conditions speculative. In particular, we cannot yet decide which indirect aircraft effect scenario is more plausible, and options suggested to mitigate the problem remain uncertain...|$|R
