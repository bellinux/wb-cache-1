25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or <b>bisacodyl</b> suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E

50|$|When <b>bisacodyl</b> is {{administered}} orally, {{it is usually}} taken at bedtime.

Normally the dosage is 5 or 10 mg, but up to 30 mg can be taken for complete cleansing of the bowel before a procedure. If taken at the maximum dosage, there will likely be a sudden, extremely powerful, uncontrollable bowel movement and so precautions should be taken.

All endoscopic procedures were conducted in the afternoon. The endoscopist was blinded to the preparation the patient had received and graded the quality of colon cleansing as excellent, good, fair, poor, or failed. Patients' demographic data, indications for the procedure, and colonoscopic findings were recorded and compared. Results: Significantly improved (p < 0. 001) bowel preparation after NaP compared with <b>bisacodyl</b> plus water lavage was reported. The completion rate of colonoscopy was significantly lower (p < 0. 001) in the <b>bisacodyl</b> group (70. 6 %) than in the NaP group (92. 9 %).

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of different doses of sodium phosphate (NaP) and polyethylenglicol (PEG) alone or with <b>bisacodyl</b> for colonic cleansing in constipated and non-constipated patients. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-nine patients, older than 18 years old, with low risk for renal damage and who were scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy were randomized to receive {{one of the following}} preparations (prep) : 90 mL of NaP (prep 1); 45 mL of NaP + 20 mg of <b>bisacodyl</b> (prep 2); 4 L of PEG (prep 3) or 2 L of PEG + 20 mg of <b>bisacodyl</b> (prep 4). Randomization was stratified by constipation. Patients, endoscopists, endoscopists&#x 2019; assistants and data analysts were blinded. A blinding challenge was performed to endoscopist in order to reassure blinding. The primary outcome was {{the efficacy of}} colonic cleansing using a previous reported scale. Secondary outcomes were tolerability, compliance, side effects, endoscopist perception about the necessity to repeat the study due to an inadequate colonic preparation and patient overall perceptions. RESULTS: Information about the primary outcome was obtained from 324 patients (93 %). There were no significant differences regarding the preparation quality among different groups in the overall analysis. Compliance was higher in the NaP preparations being even higher in half-dose with bisacodyl: 94 % (prep 1), 100 % (prep 2), 81 % (prep 3) and 87 % (prep 4) (2 vs 1, 3 and 4, P < 0. 01; 1 vs 3, 4, P < 0. 05). The combination of <b>bisacodyl</b> with NaP was associated with insomnia (P = 0. 04). In non-constipated patients the preparation quality was also similar between different groups, but endoscopist appraisal about the need to repeat the study was more frequent in the half-dose PEG plus <b>bisacodyl</b> than in whole dose NaP preparation: 11 % (prep 4) vs 2 % (prep 1) (P < 0. 05). Compliance in this group was also higher with the NaP preparations: 95 % (prep 1), 100 % (prep 2) vs 80 % (prep 3) (P < 0. 05). <b>Bisacodyl</b> was associated with abdominal pain: 13 % (prep 1), 31 % (prep 2), 21 % (prep 3) and 29 % (prep 4), (2, 4 vs 1, 2, P < 0. 05). In constipated patients the combination of NaP plus <b>bisacodyl</b> presented higher rates of satisfactory colonic cleansing than whole those PEG: 95 % (prep 2) vs 66 % (prep 3) (P = 0. 03). Preparations containing <b>bisacodyl</b> were not associated with adverse effects in constipated patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus is {{a common}} {{condition}} after abdominal surgery. Many prokinetic drugs have been evaluated including osmotic laxatives. The data on colon-stimulating laxatives are scarce. This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial investigates {{the effect of the}} colon-stimulating laxative <b>bisacodyl</b> on postoperative ileus in elective colorectal resections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2004 and February 2007, 200 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to receive either <b>bisacodyl</b> or placebo. Primary endpoint was time to gastrointestinal recovery (mean time to first flatus passed, first defecation, and first solid food tolerated; GI- 3). Secondary endpoints were incidence and duration of nasogastric tube reinsertion, incidence of vomiting, length of hospital stay, and visual analogue scores for pain, cramps, and nausea. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine patients were analyzed, and 31 patients discontinued the study. Groups were comparable in baseline demographics. Time to GI- 3 was significantly shorter in the <b>bisacodyl</b> group (3. 0 versus 3. 7 days, P = 0. 007). Of the single parameters defining GI- 3, there was a 1 -day difference in time to defecation in favor to the <b>bisacodyl</b> group (3. 0 versus 4. 0 days, P = 0. 001), whereas no significant difference in time to first flatus or tolerance of solid food was seen. No significant difference in the secondary endpoints was seen. Morbidity and mortality did not differ between groups.

40|$|Cancer stem-like cells {{reside in}} hypoxic and {{slightly}} acidic tumor niches. Such microenvironments favor more aggressive undifferentiated phenotypes and a slow growing "quiescent state" which preserves them from chemotherapeutic agents that essentially target proliferating cells. Our {{objective was to}} identify compounds active on glioblastoma stem-like cells, including under conditions that mimick those found in vivo within this most severe and incurable form of brain malignancy. We screened the Prestwick Library to identify cytotoxic compounds towards glioblastoma stem-like cells, either in a proliferating state or in more slow-growing "quiescent" phenotype resulting from non-renewal of the culture medium in vitro. Compound effects were assessed by ATP-level determination using a cell-based assay. Twenty active molecules belonging to different pharmacological classes have thus been identified. Among those, the stimulant laxative drug <b>bisacodyl</b> was the sole to inhibit in a potent and specific manner the survival of quiescent glioblastoma stem-like cells. Subsequent structure-function relationship studies led to identification of 4, 4 '-dihydroxydiphenyl- 2 -pyridyl-methane (DDPM), the deacetylated form of <b>bisacodyl,</b> as the pharmacophore. To our knowledge, <b>bisacodyl</b> is currently the only known compound targeting glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells in their quiescent, more resistant state.
