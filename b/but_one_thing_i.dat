2500|$|After {{witnessing}} the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates {{that he thinks}} that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates replies, “I think I am. I shouldn’t like to take my oath on the whole story, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> am ready to fight {{for as long as}} I can, in word and act—that is, that we shall be better, braver, and more active men if we believe it right to look for what we don’t know...” ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
60|$|ASHER. Certainly. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> set my {{face against}} {{as a matter}} of principle, I won't {{recognize}} the unions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{only very}} much interested--that's all. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> don't understand. What had Mr. Goldenheart {{to do with}} all this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>BUT</b> IN <b>ONE</b> <b>THING</b> <b>I</b> HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE, I OUGHT TO [...] HAVE SHUCKED MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED.|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> SHOULD like, if Mr. Drinkwater won't mind my {{mentioning}} it. It's {{so important}} if he's to attend on Marzo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, dear Ethel, I {{should be}} very sorry, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> am sure of, that there is {{something}} amiss in your way of going on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll find it all go as {{naturally}} {{as possible}} when I have ceased {{to stay and}} be troublesome. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> must say in your favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, about heaps and {{heaps of}} things. I couldn't {{tell you in}} a month all I think about; <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> think most about is a man-of-war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose she}} will. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{should like to}} know. Why shouldn't she tell me before she goes that she'll have me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas," [...] said Dick, [...] "I can {{not tell}} you anything. <b>But</b> of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> feel sure, and that is that he would like her to come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that. We're {{alike in}} some respects: pretty speeches don't appeal to us. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> must tell you--don't delay out yonder, {{come back as}} soon as you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mackellar," [...] said he, with a {{wonderful}} return to his old manner and appearance, [...] "you may {{say what you will}} of me, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> never was--I was never selfish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Clym, [...] "whatever you do, {{you will}} always be dear to me--that you know. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{have a right to}} say, which is, that at my age I am old enough to know what is best for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] replied Cardatas, curtly. [...] "How should I? <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do know, {{and that}} is that I shall lie to until morning, and then we can feel our way near to the coast and see what it does mean." ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. Oh, are you there, sir? Faith, it was kindly done of you {{to hinder}} me of a good husband this afternoon: And <b>but</b> for <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> would resolve to leave your house.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Stubbs {{shook his}} head gently, and smiled with {{infinite}} patience. [...] "P’raps so," [...] he said modestly. [...] "P’raps so; <b>but</b> there’s <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can do, and that is, I can read people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Captain,' <b>I</b> {{broke in}} eagerly. 'It is as much, or more, {{for your own}} sake than mine that I ask it. Do not allow this unhappy man to be murdered.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy's ball dress--a {{present from}} kind Lady Janet--is finished. I {{was allowed to}} see the first trial, or {{preliminary}} rehearsal, of this work of art. I don't in the least understand the merits of silk and lace; <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know--my wife {{will be the most}} beautiful woman at the ball.|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[Not heeding his interruption--revengefully.] <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{never wrote}} you. It {{was one of}} them cousins that you think is such nice people--the {{youngest}} son--Paul--that started me wrong. [Loudly.] It wasn't none of my fault. I hated him worse 'n hell and he knew it. But he was big and strong--[Pointing to Burke]--like you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do know, mamma, {{and that is}} that Prince Beaton isn't the F. F. P. for me. How strange you are, mamma! Don't {{you think it would be}} {{perfectly}} disgusting to accept a person you didn't care for, and let him go on and love you and marry you? It's sickening." ...|$|E
60|$|FIRST GENTLEMAN. There is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> against them. <b>I</b> {{know not}} if you know.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am looking}} forward to {{studying}} your country closely," [...] he said. [...] "What I have seen of it has charmed me. So far I have come across <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>I</b> would gladly change." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{know about}} that," [...] Matt objected. [...] "Might {{be a lot}} of dog in 'm, for all you can tell. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know sure, an' that there's no gettin' away from." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten--the Sambre. In my {{excitement}} I {{never gave}} it a thought until I saw it, deep and broad, gleaming in the morning sunlight. It barred my path, and the Prussians howled behind me. I galloped to the brink, but the horse refused the plunge. I spurred him, but the bank was high and the stream deep.|$|E
60|$|For some minutes I stood, bewildered, dazed, doubting whether I {{had been}} awake or dreaming. My mind could not grasp what had happened,--even my {{imagination}} {{could not help}} me. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew: whether this had all been real, or whether {{it had been a}} dream, I had seen the face of Sylvia. This I knew as I knew I lived.|$|E
6000|$|Carol was furious. [...] "I don't {{pretend that}} Will has no faults. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do know: He's as simple-hearted {{about what you}} call 'goings-on' as a babe. And if he ever were such a sad dog as to look at another woman, I {{certainly}} hope he'd have spirit enough to do the tempting, and not be coaxed into it, as in your depressing picture!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] I replied. [...] "I cannot say {{anything}} about that. <b>But</b> of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> am certain, and that is, that if any germs of any kind entered my system, it is perfectly free from them now." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{tell how}} this may be: <b>but</b> of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{think we may}} be sure--That this saying of our Lord's is very deep, and very wide; and applies to many people, in many times--perhaps to us in these modern times.|$|R
6000|$|At last he said, [...] "Lillie, I {{have done}} almost every thing you ever asked; <b>but</b> this <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> cannot do,--it {{is a matter}} of principle. I never drink wine, never have it on my table, never give it, because I have pledged myself not to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; it's a secret," [...] Amelius proceeded, [...] "as you say. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{may tell}} you, without {{breaking}} my promise. Mrs. Farnaby has--well! has {{filled me with}} kindly feeling towards her. She has a claim, poor soul, to my truest sympathy. And I shall remember her claim. And I shall be faithful to what I feel towards her as long as I live!" ...|$|E
60|$|You may readily trust, my dear Sir, {{that any}} {{exertion}} {{in my power}} is heartily at your service. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> must hint to you; the very name of Peter Finder is of great service to your publication, so get a verse from him now and then; though I have no objection, as well as I can, to {{bear the burden of}} the business.|$|E
60|$|They {{spoke of}} many things I didn't understand. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> was sure I caught {{from time to time}} quite distinctly, and that was the oft-repeated name, Maloka. They were talking of Maloka, Maloka, Maloka. Was this Maloka? I asked myself more than once. If so, I should like to {{take a good look at}} the man who has to be Kea's future husband.|$|E
6000|$|Stockdale turned pale, but {{he spoke}} quietly. 'Then, Lizzy, we must part. I cannot go against my {{principles}} in this matter, and I cannot make my profession a mockery. You know how I love you, and what I {{would do for}} you; <b>but</b> this <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> cannot do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, dear, dear!" [...] sighed Mrs. Peckover, [...] "I wish I'd {{seen her}} then! She was as happy, I dare say, as the bird on the tree. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can't exactly make out yet," [...] she added--"how {{did you first}} come to know all about Mary's child?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. That couldn't {{have been}} {{anywhere}} around here or I {{certainly would have}} heard about it. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do know," [...] added the foreman suddenly. [...] "There's a man named Jarley Bangs who owns a ranch {{on the other side}} of the river--a small place next to the one run by Bimbel." ...|$|R
