5|$|Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct bipedal {{humanoid}} race of reptilian {{creatures and}} loyally serves the series' recurring villain Shao Kahn in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has {{been featured in}} almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the 2011 reboot, {{he had yet to}} <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.|$|E

King Albert I awarded Camille van Hove the Civic Cross (1st Class) for his efforts in attempting to rescue the victims of the crash. Mr van Hove received serious burns and was still in hospital in Bruges at the time the award was notified. Nine other rescuers were given rewards of money.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{brought along}} new {{architectural}} styles; including expressionism, best {{exemplified by the}} designs of architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and Nordic Classicism, which enjoyed brief popularity {{in the early decades}} of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalist architecture. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House and Johan Otto von Spreckelsen's Grande Arche de la Défense in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as Bjarke Ingels to <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> excellence both at home and abroad.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015 the {{intention}} to introduce a single new long service medal for all three Arms of the Service was announced, to replace the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military), the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (1848) and the Royal Air Force Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The proposed medal will be awarded after fifteen years of service, regardless of rank, and while the good conduct element of the award criteria will remain, it will only apply to {{the last five years}} of the fifteen-year aggregate time served requirement. With this medal Officers, who have had no medallic recognition for long service unless they were commissioned after serving at least twelve years in the ranks, will also <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> their dedication. Subject to agreement from Her Majesty The Queen, a new medal design will be commissioned and the first presentations should take place in 2016.|$|E

500|$|In hindsight, Lewis' no-win {{evaluation}} of the situation appears correct: the party would not <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> its efforts by the electorate. [...] In the 1974 election, the NDP were reduced to 16 seats. Lewis lost his seat, leading him to resign as party leader in 1975. It was revealed immediately after the election {{that he had been}} battling leukemia for about two years; he had reportedly kept everyone, including his family, unaware of his condition.|$|E
500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his reign, Emperor Xingzong would have to compete for power with his mother, whose supporters still held key postings, and whose influence was so great that she was eventually allowed to return to the capital and undergo a ceremony to symbolically de-exile herself. Zhong Yuan, for his part, would <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> revealing his mother's plot by being given a succession of higher- and higher-ranking positions, culminating with a governorship outside of the capital. Historian Frederick W. Mote explains the importance of this factional infighting and its relation to the Liao dynasty's downfall by stating that it [...] "shows to what extent the succession issue within the imperial clan still was the source of weakness in the leadership of the state. It wasted people, diverted energies, and deflected the attention of the rulers from the tasks of governing." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{presence}} {{on social media}} has drawn analysis from journalists. Time named her [...] "Twitter's most outspoken (and beloved) commentator". The New York Times writer Jenna Wortham commended Cher on her social media usage, saying [...] "Most celebrities' social-media feeds feel painfully self-aware and thirsty... In her own way, Cher is an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit and yell (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> it. Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths. Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye." [...] Monica Heisey of The Guardian called Cher's Twitter profile [...] "a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet", and stated, [...] "While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1960 Report of the Committee on Transactions in Seeds {{set up by}} Parliament {{entitled}} Plant Breeders' Rights [...] {{stated that}} whilst two thirds of breeding work was by then carried out by government organisations, one third was {{in the hands of}} private breeders. And yet the only non-government funded agricultural crop plant breeding, research and testing establishment visited by the Committee was to Gartons Limited. The United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964 allowed plant breeders [...] to fully protect and <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> their introductions. The last variety bred by Gartons, 'Apex' wheat, was the first British bred wheat to be awarded plant breeders rights in 1967 under this legislation.|$|E
2500|$|Black Kettle {{began by}} saying to Hazen, [...] "The Cheyennes, when {{south of the}} Arkansas, {{do not wish to}} return to the north side because they feared trouble there, but were {{continually}} told that they had better go there, as they would <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> so doing." [...] Hardoff notes that by the terms of the Medicine Lodge Treaty, the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation had the Arkansas River as its northern boundary. In April 1868, the U.S. Army distributed food provisions due the Cheyennes and Arapahoes at Fort Larned and Fort Dodge, both north of the Arkansas. Further, on August 9, 1868, they had distributed treaty annuities in the form of arms and ammunition at Fort Larned rather than south of the Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|Salvage law has as a {{basis that}} a salvor should <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> risking {{his or her life}} and {{property}} to rescue the property of another from peril. Salvage law is in some ways similar to the wartime law of prize, the capture, condemnation and sale of a vessel and its cargo as a spoil of war, insofar as both compensate the salvor/captors for risking life and property. [...] The two areas of law may dovetail. [...] For instance, a vessel taken as a prize, then recaptured by friendly forces {{on its way to the}} prize adjudication, is not deemed a prize of the rescuers (title merely reverts to the original owner). [...] But the rescuing vessel is entitled to a claim for salvage. [...] Likewise a vessel found badly damaged, abandoned and adrift after enemy fire disabled her does not become a prize of a rescuing friendly vessel, but the rescuers may claim salvage.|$|E

[...] and [...] "Why would {{you go to a}} cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] Another, Susan Estrich, said [...] "I teach criminal law. But what are we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university. Instead, they hire them lawyers to trash the victim and the prosecutor." [...] Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case {{with some of the most}} inflammatory claims and supported Nifong's withholding of evidence saying, [...] "Nifong should <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism." [...] Murphy said [...] "I never, ever met a false rape claim, by the way. My own statistics speak to the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1774 Phillip {{joined the}} Portuguese Navy as a captain, {{serving in the}} War against Spain. While with the Portuguese Navy, Phillip {{commanded}} a frigate, the Nossa Senhora do Pilar. On this ship he took a detachment of troops from Rio de Janeiro to Colonia do Sacramento on the Rio de la Plata (opposite Buenos Aires) to relieve the garrison there. This voyage also conveyed a consignment of convicts assigned to carry out work at Colonia. During a storm encountered {{in the course of}} the voyage, the convicts assisted in working the ship and, on arrival at Colonia, Phillip recommended that they <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> saving the ship by remission of their sentences. A garbled version of this eventually found its way into the English press when Phillip was appointed in 1786 to lead the expedition to Sydney. Phillip played a leading part in the capture of the Spanish ship San Agustín, on 19 April 1777, off Santa Catarina. The San Agustin was commissioned into the Portuguese Navy as the Santo Agostinho, and command of her was given to Phillip. The action was reported in the English press: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lu Su led his {{followers}} and some civilians southward to Juchao County to join Zhou Yu. He ordered able-bodied {{young men to}} guard the rear while the others moved ahead first. The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his party from leaving. When the riders caught up with them, Lu Su turned back and said, [...] "You're all men of courage, so you should understand the situation well. The country {{is now in a}} state of chaos. You won't <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for</b> your efforts (even if you succeed in stopping us), but neither will you be punished if you don't pursue us. Do you really want to force us (to fight)?" [...] He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it, piercing through the shield. The horsemen agreed with what Lu Su said and knew they could not stop him, so they gave up and left. Lu Su then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who felt that Lu Su was a special person. Lu Su settled in Qu'e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). When his grandmother died, he returned to Dongcheng County to attend her funeral.|$|E

2500|$|In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Ai {{yield the}} throne to him, ending Tang Dynasty and {{starting}} a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. [...] Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan, along with several other regional governors, refused to recognize the new Later Liang emperor, but after a joint declaration by Wang and Yang Wo the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) failed to caused a mass uprising by Later Liang subjects, Wang decided to declare himself emperor of a new state of Shu (known in history as Former Shu). [...] He respected the Tang officials who fled to his realm, and Zhang Ge was among those people that he treated well. [...] As of 908, Zhang was serving as an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) {{when there was a}} Buddhist monk who gauged one eyeball out and offered to Wang as a sign of his devotion. [...] Wang was initially touched and was ready to award food enough to feed 10,000 monks. [...] Zhang urged against it, pointing out that mutilating oneself was not something that should <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> <b>for.</b> [...] Wang agreed. [...] Shortly after, Zhang, who was also by that point referred to as the deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang), was made Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng)) and a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事).
