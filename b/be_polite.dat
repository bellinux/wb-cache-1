5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Drew (Drew Carey) {{and his friends}} Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) in their local bar, the Warsaw Tavern, {{discussing}} Brad Pitt. The following day, Drew's best friend Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) tells him that she has broken up with her boyfriend, who then fired her from {{her job as a}} receptionist at his body shop. Desperate for a job, Kate asks Drew to hire her at the Winfred-Louder department store where he is the assistant director of personnel. Drew insists that he cannot hire his friends. At Winfred-Louder, Drew's boss Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak) asks him to hire someone for a position at the cosmetics counter. While conducting interviews, Drew meets Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a hostile woman who wears too much eye shadow. Drew tries to <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> but Mimi soon realizes {{he is not going to}} give her the job and accuses Drew of being sexist. Mimi complains to Mr. Bell about Drew, getting him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E

Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's had followed the courtesy campaigns by the STPB with 'interest and amusement: interest because most people were responsive to the campaign; amusement because no one protested that it was absurd to teach Singaporeans to <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to tourists’.|$|E

25|$|Social {{and natural}} is easy – When {{interacting}} with media, Reeves and Nass (1996) argue, “people {{should be able}} to use what comes naturally – rules for social relationships and rules for navigating the physical world,” (p.255).

25|$|The Stationmaster and The Postmaster – Both {{officials}} {{attend the}} Gayevs' party in Act III. Although they both play minor roles (the Stationmaster attempts to recite a poem, and the Postmaster flirts with Dunyasha), they are mostly {{symbols of the}} deprecation of the aristocracy in 1900s Russia – Firs comments that, whereas once they had barons and lords at the ball, now it's the postman and the stationmaster, and even they come only to <b>be</b> <b>polite.</b>|$|E
25|$|German {{soldiers}} {{were ordered to}} <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to the islanders, and in the beginning, they were. There were no rules against them fraternising {{so long as they}} behaved like gentlemen. Soldiers were punished for crimes against civilians. As the war progressed and {{soldiers were}} rotated out to other war zones, however, the quality of soldiers decreased, affecting their manners and attitudes. Serious problems started to arise {{in the last year of}} occupation when food was in short supply.|$|E

From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. He hated the destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided him {{just as they did}} in Tasmania. However, he enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who {{had no choice but to}} <b>be</b> <b>polite.</b> Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers.|$|E
25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once {{a week at a}} park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E

500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> and all it did was get me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting.

[...] An personally took position up in a tower, and initially the Huainan troops were still hesitant to attack him there.

2500|$|Bismarck—a Junker himself—was strong-willed, outspoken and overbearing, but {{he could}} also <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> charming and witty. Occasionally he {{displayed}} a violent temper, and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which cowed Wilhelm I. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments. As the leader of what historians call [...] "revolutionary conservatism", Bismarck became a hero to German nationalists; they built many monuments honoring {{the founder of the}} new Reich. Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany and, once that had been accomplished, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy.|$|E
