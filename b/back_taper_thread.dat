The overstressed female fitting may split days, weeks, or even years after initial installation. Therefore many municipal plumbing codes restrict the use of threaded plastic pipe fittings.|$|R

50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a <b>tapered</b> <b>thread</b> that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and leadscrews). The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the labyrinth seal created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread seal tape or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope. <b>Tapered</b> <b>thread</b> joints typically do not include a gasket.|$|R

Thirty-eight frozen stress models were analysed and it was found that a two degree taper for 5. 5 threads from the loaded face of the nut reduced the maximum normalised tensile stress in the bolt by 41 per cent from 5. 17 to 3. 07. It was observed that if the angle of taper was too large the stress concentration produced at the junction of the parallel and <b>tapered</b> <b>threads</b> could negate the beneficial effects of the taper geometry. ...|$|R

40|$|In a bolted joint, it {{is known}} that {{failures}} usually happen {{at the root of the}} first bolt thread where the maximum stress concentration occurs. Previously several methods were proposed to reduce the stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, <b>tapering</b> <b>threads</b> have been widely used in mechanical structures. Those types of threads are called CD bolts, which were proposed by Nishida as an effective method for stress reduction. Several experimental studies indicated that CD bolts have higher fatigue strength although little FEM analyses is available. In this study, therefore, the bolted joint with <b>tapered</b> <b>threads</b> is analyzed with the finite element method, and stress reduction effect of CD bolts is discussed with varying geometrical conditions. The reduction of the stress concentration is realized by <b>tapering</b> bolt <b>thread.</b> Then, it is found that the stress reduction is notable when the height of bolt threads is reduced significantly near the bolt heat and the nut is closer to the bolt head. According to those results, optimum conditions for stress reduction are discussed. Then, it is shown that the maximum stress can be decreased by 20 % compared with the cases of standard bolts and nuts...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of parallel and <b>tapered</b> <b>threaded</b> post placement on the strain and stress distribution of endodontically treated teeth.

A strain-gauge was fixed on the proximal surface perpendicular to the long root axis, 2 mm from the cervical limit.

A scanning electron microscope was used to examine the longitudinal root sections. Stress was evaluated for each group in a two-dimensional finite element analysis. The models were meshed with tetrahedron elements and loaded with 2 N at an angle of 135 &# 176; to the lingual face. The equivalent Von Mises stress was calculated.

5000|$|Galvanized steel {{potable water}} supply and {{distribution}} pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3/8 in to 2 in. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe <b>Thread</b> (NPT) standard <b>tapered</b> male <b>threads,</b> which connect with female <b>tapered</b> <b>threads</b> on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as [...] "galv" [...] or [...] "iron" [...] in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader. It remains in common use for repair of existing [...] "galv" [...] systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

50|$|Taper tap: The small tap {{illustrated}} at {{the bottom}} of the image is similar to an intermediate tap but has a more pronounced taper to the cutting edges. This feature gives the taper tap a very gradual cutting action that is less aggressive than that of the plug tap. The number of <b>tapered</b> <b>threads</b> typically ranges from 8 to 10. A taper tap is most often used when the material to be tapped is difficult to work (e.g., alloy steel) or the tap is of a very small diameter and thus prone to breakage.|$|R
