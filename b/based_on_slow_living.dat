The former may be responsible for the formation of the bilayer structure. The disadvantages of this method are that a small amount of ether is frequently present in the vesicles suspension and is difficult to remove.|$|R

40|$|The {{simplest}} {{models of}} inflation <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>slow</b> roll produce nearly scale invariant primordial power spectra (PPS). But {{there are also}} numerous models that predict radically broken scale invariant PPS. In particular, markedly cuspy dips in the PPS correspond to nulls where the perturbation amplitude, hence PPS, goes through a zero at a specific wavenumber. Near this wavenumber, the true quantum nature of the generation mechanism of the primordial fluctuations may be revealed. Naively these features may appear to arise from fine tuned initial conditions. However, we show that this behavior arises under fairly generic set of conditions involving super-Hubble scale evolution of perturbation modes during inflation. We illustrate this with the well-studied examples of punctuated inflation and the Starobinsky-break model. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures; Accepted for publication in PR...|$|R

It appears that the 70 – 130 Hz band and the 170 - 230 Hz band performs better than the traditional 2 – 40 Hz band. In a second step we applied the same analysis to the estimated local field potentials from the scalp EEG.
