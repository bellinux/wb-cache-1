50|$|Bypass {{switches}} {{move the}} {{single point of failure}} from the in-line monitoring appliance to the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> itself. This {{should be a}} net gain in reliability, because the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> is a simpler device than the monitoring appliance, and because it is designed for fault-tolerance. Nevertheless, reliability is an important criterion when evaluating <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> solutions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> {{monitors}} {{the status of}} the links between its monitor ports and the in-line appliance. If a link goes down, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> immediately switches into bypass- mode. Some manufacturers of bypass TAPs/switches still send traffic to the appliance during bypass mode. When the link comes back up again, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> returns to bypass-off normal.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> {{has four}} ports. Two network ports create an in-line {{connection}} {{in the network}} link {{that is to be}} monitored. This connection is fully passive; if the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> itself loses power, traffic continues to flow unimpeded through the link. Two monitor ports are used to connect the in-line monitoring appliance. During normal operation, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> passes all network traffic through the appliance as if it were directly in-line itself. But when the in-line appliance loses power, is disconnected, or otherwise fails, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> passes traffic directly between its network ports, bypassing the appliance, and ensuring that traffic continues to flow on the network link.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bypass</b> <b>switches</b> {{increase}} network reliability {{through several}} mechanisms including passive in-line connections, link detection, and heartbeat packets.|$|R
50|$|Whenever the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> {{transitions}} to bypass mode for any reason, the link may be temporarily dropped. A good <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> reconnects the link in under 1 second, but the network may take several seconds to re-establish communications on link.|$|E
50|$|Some bypass {{switches}} send {{a heartbeat}} packet through the monitoring appliance {{in order to}} ensure that the appliance is passing traffic. If the heartbeat packet does not return to the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch,</b> the appliance is assumed to be down, and the switch goes into bypass-on mode, excluding the appliance from the traffic path. The <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> continues to transmit heartbeat packets to the appliance, and when they are again returned by the appliance, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> changes back to bypass-off mode and the appliance resumes receiving traffic....|$|E
50|$|The Rectiverter module {{contains}} an AC/AC connection which {{eliminates the need}} for a separate centralized static <b>bypass</b> <b>switch.</b> In addition, the AC output port is designed for supplying an overcurrent pulse for tripping Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs) and clear short circuit currents. The advantages of the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> are maintained while the single point of failure is eliminated.|$|E

50|$|The CFA has {{the useful}} {{property}} that when power is shut off, the input simply passes to the output {{with very little}} loss. This avoids the need for RF <b>bypass</b> <b>switching</b> {{in the event of}} failure.|$|R
50|$|Using an {{external}} <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> to connect an in-line appliance {{such as a}} NGFW, IPS, or DDoS has several benefits.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> (or bypass TAP) is a {{hardware}} device {{that provides a}} fail-safe access port for an in-line active security appliance such as an intrusion prevention system (IPS), next generation firewall (NGFW), etc. Active, in-line security appliances are single points of failure in live computer networks because if the appliance loses power, experiences a software failure, or is taken off-line for updates or upgrades, traffic can no longer flow through the critical link. The <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> or bypass tap removes this point of failure by automatically 'switching traffic via bypass mode' to keep the critical network link up.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> or TAP {{monitors}} {{the health of}} the active, in-line appliance by sending heartbeats to the in-line security appliance as long as the in band security appliance is on-line, the heartbeat packets will be returned to the switch/TAP, and the link traffic will continue to flow through the in-line security appliance.|$|E

50|$|The two network {{ports in}} a <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> create a fully passive in-line {{connection}} that maintains traffic flow {{even in the}} absence of power. For fiber links, a normally closed optical switch creates a path for light to flow unimpeded through the device when power is absent. For copper links, micro-relays connect the two ports when power is absent.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2014, it was {{announced}} that the Canadian government had removed the mandatory requirement from Sikorsky to supply the CH-148 with a 30-minute run-dry main gearbox. This was a key safety feature defined as mandatory in the original RFQ and one of 7 concessions made to Sikorsky. [...] The Canadian government states these concessions will not affect the safety of Armed Forces personnel. However, oil loss in the main gearbox followed by several other factors caused the 2009 crash of a S-92, a civil version of the helicopter, off the coast of Newfoundland. [...] Sikorsky has added an oil cooler <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> and states a similar accident is extremely unlikely. The effectiveness of the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> has been questioned as it assumes that the leak will happen within the oil cooler assembly, and that the bypass can be activated in time to maintain enough oil. In the case of the S-92 crash, a titanium stud sheared causing catastrophic oil loss through the oil filter assembly.|$|E

5000|$|However, in {{the quiet}} of a studio, with {{sensitive}} recording equipment, this same buzz or hum would be unacceptable. As such, studio musicians use pro-grade guitar amplifiers that have ground lift switches, which can be toggled to remove ground loop hum. Similarly, whereas a working guitarist can use standard quality plastic case effect pedals and preamplifiers, session musicians typically use expensive boutique pedals which have heavy-gauge metal chassis (which prevent noise from nearby magnetic fields from affecting the sound), true <b>bypass</b> <b>switching,</b> studio-grade preamps, discrete Class-A signal paths, opto-couplers for noiseless switching, and isolated transformers to prevent buzz and hum.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Fender {{introduced}} the Fender Jaguar Bass, as of 2008 available in Hot Rod Red, Olympic White, Sunburst and Black finishes, with a three-ply white or tortoise pickguard. This is {{a variation on}} the traditional Jazz Bass design—differences being that it has only one master volume and tone, but additional on/off switches for pickup selection, series/parallel switching, and a two-band active preamp with <b>bypass</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|In some products, {{when the}} <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> shunts traffic around the {{monitoring}} appliance, the monitor ports revert to {{acting like a}} network tap, mirroring the half-duplex traffic received at the network ports to the monitor ports. In this mode, an attached IPS appliance {{can be used as}} an intrusion detection system (IDS) to passively monitor the traffic without affecting it. This mode is useful for analyzing the effectiveness of a signature set before switching to IPS mode and potentially disrupting network traffic.|$|E
5000|$|To {{augment the}} company's {{standalone}} phono preamplifiers, standalone line stage preamplifiers were introduced next, known as Linear Control Centers or LCC. One of the innovative {{features of the}} LCC was a <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> that permitted the user to select {{the use of an}} internal amplification module or straight into the potentiometer for volume control. Originally labeled 0dB (line stage in) or -20dB (passive only) this feature remained with all future PS Audio line stages and preamplifiers, later becoming labeled Straightwire in or out.|$|E

40|$|The prototypes of the {{elements}} of UNK quench protection system [...] - quench detectors on magnetic modulators, quench stopper, safety leads, <b>bypass</b> <b>switches</b> [...] - are studied on the string of 4 UNK superconducting magnets. The string simulates the operation of two quench protection units (QPU). Many quenches at the various parts of SC circuit from 1 kA up to UNK nominal current 5 kA were induced. No quench propagation from one to another QPU was observed. Parameters of quench protection system elements corresponded to tolerated ones. I. INTRODUCTION. The quench protection system (QPS) for the UNK ring electromagnet is based on breaking the whole ring into cells (QPU), shunting them with thyristor switches placed at the exterior of the cryostats at the ambient temperature and energy removal from the remaining part of the ring onto dump resistors [1].

50|$|Centralized static bypass {{switches}} (also called Static Transfer Switch, STS) {{are commonly}} used in UPS systems for bypassing the UPS, connecting the load directly to the grid. The switch has a great overload capability and will supply required short circuit currents for tripping fuses for fault clearings. A disadvantage of a centralized static <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> {{is the need for}} a separate compartment/cabinet for the switch itself. Other disadvantages are the fact that you need to design for full system power from start, {{and the fact that the}} centralized switch will introduce a single point of failure in the system.|$|E

40|$|Hot {{spotting}} is a reliability {{problem in}} photovoltaic (PV) panels where a mismatched cell heats up significantly and degrades panel performance. High temperatures due to hot spotting can damage cell encapsulant {{and lead to}} second breakdown; both cause permanent damage to the PV panel. Although bypass diodes are used for protection and qualification tests are used to reduce cell mismatch, these strategies are shown to be insufficient for hot spot prevention. This paper reexamines the hot spot problem in PV strings through simulation and load-line analysis. Results show that cells in typical panel string lengths are susceptible to hot spotting because of reverse bias behavior. A number of existing and emerging solutions aimed at hot spot prevention are discussed and evaluated. Commercially available active <b>bypass</b> <b>switches</b> are an improvement over passive diodes but do not prevent hot spotting. Cells with low breakdown voltages limit power dissipation but are not fully vetted as a long-term solution. A combination of hot spot detection and open-circuit protection is a complete solution to hot spotting. close...|$|R
