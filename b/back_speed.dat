50|$|The {{marriage}} falters, {{and when}} Nancy is {{fed up with}} many lonely nights alone, she leaves Speed. In trying to win her <b>back,</b> <b>Speed</b> crashes while stunting over her house. Grounded and facing a court-martial, the disgraced pilot finds out that his best friend is missing while on an Arctic rescue mission. Nancy coaxes Speed and his co-pilot, O'Hara (Warren Hymer), to attempt a rescue, and after a harrowing crash-landing in the Arctic, an injured Ray is located. Speed manages a dangerous takeoff and flies his friend back home, to find a relieved Nancy waiting for him.|$|E

40|$|The lateral septum is {{associated}} with the regulation of innate behavior, motivation, and locomotion. Its complex interconnections with cognitive and affective regions such as the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and medial septum have made it an attractive region for studying how motivation regulates behavior in context-specific settings. This GABAergic brain region’s main output is the lateral hypothalamus, which provides downstream signaling of motor commands. Even though stimulation of lateral septum projections to the hypothalamus have shown to decrease running speed in free behaving mice, characterizing movement kinematics due to LS activation has not been studied. GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the lateral septum were selectively activated through the use of optogenetic techniques in transgenic mice. Photostimulation of the lateral septum at theta frequencies caused a non-significant decrease in head and <b>back</b> <b>speed.</b> 3 D motion analysis of body movement under photostimulation was quantified, revealing a slow, linear decrease of body speed as photostimulation progressed. These results support the role of lateral septum activation in movement regulation and shed light on the specific manner in which stimulation of the LS gradually decreases movement speed.

40|$|Most {{of us are}} {{familiar}} with stretching and shooting rubber bands. However, it is not immediately obvious to state {{which side of the}} rubber band will hit a predetermined target first. When a rubber band is stretched and suddenly released an axial stress wave propagates towards the end it is divides the rubber band into a stretched and relaxed area. As the wave reaches the end it reflects and causes a compression wave that propagates backwards causing dynamic buckling if the length of the compressed area is larger than the Euler critical length. If the elastic became unconstrained in a similar manner to shooting rubber bands, it is unknown whether buckling would occur and how it would affect the trajectory of the elastic. Using high speed photography we find dynamic buckling occurs when shooting rubber bands. Using a Neo-Hookean model for the rubber band we find that the wavelength is proportional to the thickness and the square root of the inverse stretch ratio. Moreover, we analyze the trajectory of the rubber band when shot by developing a model of the front and back speeds using the propagation of stress waves in rubber. We conclude that the both front and back speeds are proportional to a fraction of the speed of sound in the material based on the amount of stretching. Using the front and <b>back</b> <b>speed</b> scaling we show that our analysis is valid only for short time scales since at larger time scales the effects of the rubber band curvature and the rotation applied when launched tend to dominate. 2016 - 12 - 21 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

40|$|Accident and {{incident}} {{reports have}} indicated that construction workers, who comprise {{only a fraction of}} the industrial work force, suffer more fatal injuries than in any other industry. Many of these accidents and incidents involve workers being struck and run over by a reversing vehicle. During performance of their duties, construction workers are frequently in the vicinity of backup alarms mounted on a variety of vehicles, each with different <b>backing</b> <b>speeds.</b> Due to the loud ambient noise prevalent on many construction sites, workers may wear hearing protection devices, which can affect their ability to detect these backup alarms. An experiment was conducted in free-field conditions to determine the distance at which normal-hearing listeners who wore a high-attenuation earmuff could detect a standard backup alarm signal. Based on the data collected, a relationship was established between the minimum-required backup alarm detection distance and the reversing speeds for several typical vehicles...|$|R

50|$|The system employs sensors on {{the clutch}} pedal, gear shift, and transmission, and is coordinated by the ECU. When the clutch pedal is depressed, the system {{waits for the}} user to either move the shifter to a {{different}} position, or to re-engage the clutch. If a new gear is never selected but the clutch has been depressed {{long enough for the}} engine to lose speed, the system will bring the engine <b>back</b> to <b>speed</b> for the same gear if the driver begins to raise the clutch. If the shifter is moved to a higher gear and the clutch is re-engaged quickly, the system will let the natural deceleration of the engine sync the drive train with the higher gear. If the clutch is depressed long enough for the engine to fall below the speed of the higher new gear, the computer will blip the throttle to bring the engine <b>back</b> to <b>speed.</b> Most usefully, if a new, lower gear is selected, the computer will accelerate the engine to the new estimated speed, {{even to the point of}} redline.|$|R
