5|$|Specialised {{football}} <b>boots</b> {{began to}} emerge in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work <b>boots.</b> Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their <b>boots</b> to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from <b>boots.</b> By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. <b>Boots</b> of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E
5|$|Ugg <b>boots</b> (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG <b>boots</b> are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The <b>boots</b> {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The <b>boots</b> originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG <b>boots</b> emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Network <b>booting</b> is {{the process}} of <b>booting</b> a {{computer}} from a network rather than a local drive. In this paper, a novel intelligent network <b>booting</b> protocol is proposed. It extracts all the states of the clients from their <b>booting</b> requests to their normal operations, which is depicted with a finite state machine. Based on the protocol, an intelligent network <b>booting</b> system is implemented with distributed modules, where the maintenance of the network <b>booting</b> system is automated, such as the preparation of the virtual <b>booting</b> partition for the client, loading and passing the <b>booting</b> parameters, and so on. Experiments are carried out to prove the efficiency of the network <b>booting</b> system...|$|R

50|$|Some modern CPUs and {{microcontrollers}} (for example, TI OMAP) {{or sometimes}} even DSPs may have <b>boot</b> ROM with <b>boot</b> code integrated directly into their silicon, so such a processor could perform quite a sophisticated <b>boot</b> sequence {{on its own}} and load <b>boot</b> programs from various sources like NAND flash, SD or MMC card and so on. It is difficult to hardwire all the required logic for handling such devices, so an integrated <b>boot</b> ROM is used instead in such scenarios. <b>Boot</b> ROM usage enables more flexible <b>boot</b> sequences than hardwired logic could provide. For example, the <b>boot</b> ROM could try to perform <b>boot</b> from multiple <b>boot</b> sources. Also, a <b>boot</b> ROM is often able to load a <b>boot</b> loader or diagnostic program via serial interfaces like UART, SPI, USB and so on. This feature is often used for system recovery purposes when for some reasons usual <b>boot</b> software in non-volatile memory got erased, and {{it could also be}} used for initial non-volatile memory programming when there is clean non-volatile memory installed and hence no software available in the system yet.|$|R

50|$|EFI <b>Boot</b> Stub {{makes it}} {{possible}} to <b>boot</b> a Linux kernel image without the use of a conventional UEFI <b>boot</b> loader. By masquerading itself as a PE/COFF image and appearing to the firmware as a UEFI application, an x86 kernel image with EFI <b>Boot</b> Stub enabled can be directly loaded and executed by a UEFI firmware. Such kernel images can still be loaded and run by BIOS-based <b>boot</b> loaders; thus, EFI <b>Boot</b> Stub allows a single kernel image to work in any <b>boot</b> environment.|$|R

50|$|<b>Booting</b> UEFI {{systems from}} GPT-partitioned disks is {{commonly}} called UEFI-GPT <b>booting.</b> Despite {{the fact that}} the UEFI specification requires MBR partition tables to be fully supported, some UEFI firmware implementations immediately switch to the BIOS-based CSM <b>booting</b> {{depending on the type of}} <b>boot</b> disk's partition table, effectively preventing UEFI <b>booting</b> to be performed from EFI System partitions on MBR-partitioned disks. Such a <b>boot</b> scheme is commonly called UEFI-MBR.|$|R
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather <b>boots.</b> In the twentieth century, <b>boots</b> became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E
5|$|Hermes– The former God of Speed and Commerce, the Messenger of the Gods, and {{the father}} of Ceryx. Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. In God of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia. Kratos eventually caught Hermes off guard, killed him, which released a plague on the world, and took his <b>boots,</b> the <b>Boots</b> of Hermes, as his own. The character was voiced by Greg Ellis in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sindy {{manufacturers}} {{took advantage}} of new colour-changing technology and released Magic Moments Sindy, a doll whose hair and swimming costume changed colour when immersed in warm water.

As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high <b>boots,</b> ankle <b>boots,</b> trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|E

50|$|A {{separate}} DHCP server may be configured {{to assist}} interfaces equipped with network <b>boot</b> capability {{to be able}} to <b>boot</b> over iSCSI. In this case, the network interface looks for a DHCP server offering a PXE or bootp <b>boot</b> image. This is used to kick off the iSCSI remote <b>boot</b> process, using the <b>booting</b> network interface's MAC address to direct the computer to the correct iSCSI <b>boot</b> target. One can then use a software-only approach to load a small <b>boot</b> program which can in turn mount a remote iSCSI target {{as if it was a}} local SCSI drive and then fire the <b>boot</b> process from said iSCSI target. This can be achieved using an existing Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) <b>boot</b> ROM, which is available on many wired Ethernet adapters. The <b>boot</b> code can also be loaded from CD/DVD, floppy disk (or floppy disk image) and USB storage, or it can replace existing PXE <b>boot</b> code on adapters that can be re-flashed. The most popular free software to offer iSCSI <b>boot</b> support is iPXE.|$|R
