It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake {{in front of a}} white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> he entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.|$|E

2500|$|This {{little way}} of Therese is the {{foundation}} of her spirituality. [...] Within the Catholic Church Thérèse's way was known for some time as [...] "the little way of spiritual childhood," [...] but Thérèse actually wrote [...] "little way" [...] only three times, and she never wrote the phrase [...] "spiritual childhood." [...] It was her sister Pauline who, after Thérèse's death, adopted the phrase [...] "the little way of spiritual childhood" [...] to interpret Thérèse's path. Years after Thérèse's death, a Carmelite of Lisieux asked Pauline about this phrase and Pauline answered spontaneously [...] "But you know well that Thérèse never used it! It is mine." [...] In May 1897, Thérèse wrote to Father Adolphe Roulland, [...] "My way is all confidence and love."

2500|$|The Aggadah records many miracles {{performed}} by Phinehas. Among these {{is that of}} having passed on dry ground through the River Ginai, which he had to cross {{on his way to}} ransom prisoners (Yer. Demai i. 3). According to another version, Phinehas performed this miracle while he was going to the school to deliver a lecture. His pupils, who had followed him, asked if they might without danger cross the river <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> whereupon Phinehas answered: [...] "Only those who have never offended any one may do so" [...] (Hullin 7a). To Phinehas is attributed the authorship of a later midrash entitled Tadshe or Baraita de-Rabbi Pinehas ben Ya'ir. The only reasons for this ascription are the facts (1) that the midrash begins with Phinehas' explanation of Gen. , from which the work derives its name, and (2) that its seventh chapter commences with a saying of his on the tree of knowledge. Phinehas was buried in Kefar Biram.|$|E
