25|$|One day the moon, {{hearing of}} this, {{pulled on a}} black cloak over her yellow hair and went to see for herself. She fell into a pool, and a snag bound her there. She saw a man coming toward the pool and fought to be free until the hood fell off; the light helped the man make his way to safety and scared off the evil creatures. She {{struggled}} to follow until the hood fell <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> hair, and all the evil things {{came out of the}} darkness, trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke to sit on the cross-shaped snag and keep watch.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her hands}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> heart but said no word and he went on.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped as}} the word passed her lips, looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, and started violently.|$|E
60|$|Limping Lucy steadied {{herself on}} her crutch and looked <b>back</b> at me <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She {{hands him}} the nearly-emptied pipe, and sinks <b>back,</b> turning <b>over</b> on <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|The noise {{had brought}} Dejah Thoris {{to the door}} of her apartment, and there she stood {{throughout}} the conflict with Sola at <b>her</b> <b>back</b> peering <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. Her face was set and emotionless and I knew that she did not recognize me, nor did Sola.|$|R
60|$|The girl threw a {{laughing}} look <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, and vanished {{through the door}} into the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Miss Landini!" [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Erwin, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. [...] "Is that you? Where in {{the world}} are you going?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} her lead, and I saw her glance <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder at the}} young man, who seemed unaware, even, of her departure.|$|E
2500|$|... {{raising her}} light peplos to uncover {{her hips and}} buttocks, and looking <b>back</b> and down <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, perhaps to {{evaluate}} them.|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on the storyline {{in which}} Alf hits Pippa with his ute, another Daily Record {{reporter}} said [...] "The tyke {{appears in the}} odd scene or two with her mum, who only seems to either put her to bed, make her some toast or pat her on the head. It's a shame then the poor lass has to be unconscious for her biggest storyline to date. She ends up critically injured after Alf <b>backs</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> while Sally is beside herself with anguish." [...] The episode which dealt with {{the aftermath of the}} accident and Pippa's subsequent hospitalisation earned Sam Meikle a nomination for an Australian Writers' Guild Award in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Reuben {{starts to}} poach Sarah's {{patients}} to get <b>back</b> at <b>her</b> <b>over</b> the Loren situation ...|$|R
60|$|She {{swept the}} {{mantilla}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, disclosing a lovely face, strange and striking to Gale in its pride and fire, its intensity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose Jim {{will tell}} us all about him," [...] said Mrs. Bradley, dismissing the subject, as she turned her sleeves <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> white arms, preparatory to {{grappling}} certain culinary difficulties.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, and Yarmouth," [...] Mrs. Flushing called <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. [...] "Put {{those things}} away and hang 'em {{in their right}} places, there's a good girl, or it fusses Mr. Flushin'." ...|$|E
60|$|The rector rose abruptly, {{walked to}} the {{entrance}} of the arbour, and stood staring out across the garden. Presently he turned and came <b>back</b> and stood <b>over</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dorothy Gale {{is carried}} into Oz {{in her house}} by a cyclone and <b>back</b> <b>over</b> again by <b>her</b> magic shoes, which fall off during her flight and are lost in the desert.|$|R
40|$|A woman {{carrying}} {{a child on}} <b>her</b> <b>back</b> looks <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. Behind her, a young man looks at the camera.; The back of the card has no handwriting. Printed {{at the edge of}} the correspondence section is "CAMEROUN (Nord) - Pres de Maroua". "Societe des Missions Evangeliques, 102, Bd. Arago PARIS XIVc Cliche F. Perrot, La Chaux-de-Fonds"...|$|R
60|$|Sally had as fast a horse {{as there}} was on the range; she made no weight in the saddle, and she could ride. From time to time she looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "We want more, Brown," [...] {{said one}} of the ladies, glancing <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} as she poured out the last drop from her large jug; [...] "and more buns and bread, please." ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{her so much}} on edge she was {{inclined}} to answer, 'So be it.' Instead, she ran <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> own history: it consisted of petty discords in contemptible surroundings, then of her dreams and fancies, finally--Siegmund.|$|E
60|$|With {{a strong}} effort he {{mastered}} himself. Peggy had mounted a few steps, {{and was looking}} <b>back</b> at him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. He could read the meaning now in the grey eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} wouldn't interrupt!" [...] snapped Eunice with irritation. No girl {{likes to have}} to keep going <b>back</b> and trying <b>over</b> <b>her</b> speeches. [...] "It's a great compliment, but it is quite impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was four}} hours later, and Captain Blossom was just {{preparing}} {{to come on}} deck, when there, came a fearful shock which threw the Golden Wave <b>back</b> and <b>over</b> on <b>her</b> side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think there}} is anyone in the house," [...] Lucy said, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder; [...] "there is no smoke coming from the chimney, and the {{shutters}} are closed, and besides the whole place looks neglected." ...|$|E
60|$|He spoke {{sharply to}} the children, {{and told them}} to go in to their tea. Greatly surprised, for they had never heard their father speak sharply before, they went off, hand in hand, little Holly looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drop in again," [...] he said, as he {{took her}} {{trembling}} hand.... When she had walked a little way she looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder to see him leaning idly against the post, gazing after her, and waving his hammer in friendly fashion.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Delighted {{to be of}} any service." [...] Behind Miss Greenway's <b>back</b> he dramatizes <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head to Welling {{his sense}} of his own escape, and his {{compassion}} for the fellow-man whom he leaves in the toils of fate.|$|R
60|$|Quitting her, she glided to the door, softly {{turned the}} key in the lock, ascertained that it was fast, and came <b>back.</b> She bent <b>over</b> <b>her.</b> She threw <b>back</b> the curtain to admit the {{moonlight}} more freely. She gazed intently on her face.|$|R
60|$|He was {{not sure}} whether--so brief was the moment!--he had held and kissed her cheek. His arms were empty now, and he {{caught a glimpse of}} her poised on the road above him amidst the quivering, sunlit leaves, looking <b>back</b> at him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{lucky that}} {{we happen to}} have one with us!" [...] said Mrs Drew, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} where her daughter stood, concealed from view by her ample person. [...] "Marion, dear, will you part with your rose-bud to a wounded soldier?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like Mr. Bridge, anyhow," [...] {{she called}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, [...] "for {{whatever}} {{he may not}} be he is certainly a well-bred gentleman," [...] which speech did not tend to raise Mr. Bridge in the estimation of the hard-fisted ranch foreman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{a little}} thing, Marius." [...] Her glance {{travelled}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder to the}} tall, limber fellow in leather jerkin and with cross-gartered legs who lounged a dozen steps behind them. [...] "Rid me of that ruffian's company," [...] said she.|$|E
6000|$|De la Fosse cried aloud at the sight. [...] "I have no sword. You {{would not}} murder me?" [...] said he, leaning back with haggard-face and burning eyes against his chair. The bright steel {{shone in the}} lamp-light. Edith shrank <b>back,</b> <b>her</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|There--in {{the chair}} at the bedside--there, {{suddenly}} revealed under the flow {{of light from the}} candle, was the figure of a woman, reclining. <b>Her</b> head lay <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the chair. <b>Her</b> face, turned up to the ceiling, had the eyes closed, as if she was wrapped in a deep sleep.|$|R
