2500|$|Acid rock often {{encompasses}} the more extreme {{side of the}} psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and guitar-centered sound. Alan Bisbort and Parke Puterbaugh write that acid rock [...] "can {{best be described as}} psychedelia at its rawest and most intense [...] <b>Bad</b> <b>trips</b> as well as good, riots as well as peace, pain as well as pleasure - the whole spectrum of reality, not just the idyllic bits, were captured by acid rock." [...] "Acid rock" [...] has also been described as more heavily electric and containing more distortion ("fuzz") than typical psychedelic rock. By the late 1960s, in addition to the deliberate use of distortion and feedback, acid rock was further characterized by long guitar solos and the frequent use of electronic organs. Lyric references to drug use were also common, as exemplified in Jefferson Airplane's 1967 song [...] "White Rabbit" [...] and Jimi Hendrix Experience's 1967 song [...] "Purple Haze". Lyrical references to drugs such as LSD were often cryptic.|$|E

50|$|Later {{reexamination of}} Leary's data reveals his results to be skewed, whether {{intentionally}} or not; {{the percent of}} men in the study who ended up back in prison later in life was approximately 2% lower than the usual rate. Leary was later introduced to LSD, and he then incorporated that drug into his research as his mental catalyst of choice. Leary claimed that his experiments produced no murders, suicides, psychotic breaks, or <b>bad</b> <b>trips.</b> On the contrary, almost all of Leary's participants reported profound mystical experiences which they felt had a tremendously positive effect on their lives. While it is true that Leary's experiments did not lead to any murders, he willfully chose to ignore the <b>bad</b> <b>trips</b> which occurred, as well as the attempted suicide of a woman the day after she was given mescaline by Leary.|$|E

50|$|In his autobiography, Nothing's Sacred, comedian Lewis Black {{claims to}} have {{attended}} the festival with some friends. Black explains in depth his activities of the weekend, including drug experimentation, failing at his appointed parking attendant job, and the downturn the concert took after a fiery speech from a Black Panther of the militant New Haven, Connecticut contingent, which happened to coincide with a thunderstorm. Black theorizes that under the effects of hallucinogens, many attendees probably thought that the Black Panther was actually causing the storm, and many began to experience <b>bad</b> <b>trips.</b>|$|E

He attributed some of the problems to the barrels of [...] "electric water" [...] that were available for free public consumption; people were invited to drop donations of drugs into these barrels, creating drug cocktails of unknown strength and composition.

50|$|The manifestations {{can range}} from {{feelings}} of vague anxiety and alienation to profoundly disturbing states of unrelieved terror, ultimate entrapment, or complete loss of self-identity. Psychedelic specialists in the therapeutic community do not necessarily consider unpleasant experiences as threatening or negative, instead focusing on their potential to greatly benefit the user when properly resolved. <b>Bad</b> <b>trips</b> can be exacerbated by the inexperience or irresponsibility of the user {{or the lack of}} proper preparation and environment for the trip, and are reflective of unresolved psychological tensions triggered {{during the course of the}} experience.|$|E

5000|$|A trip sitter is {{sometimes}} called a psychedelic guide or guide, although this term is more often used to describe someone who takes {{an active role in}} guiding a drug user's experiences, while a sitter merely stands by to discourage <b>bad</b> <b>trips</b> and handle emergencies, but otherwise does not take on an active role. Guides are more common among spiritual users of entheogens.

5000|$|... "Lila" [...] ‒ {{played by}} Susan Stewart ‒ is a {{seemingly}} good-natured go-go dancer who strips at a seedy topless {{bar on the}} Sunset Strip. After taking LSD, Lila becomes a psychopathic serial killer. She continues to pick up men at the bar where she is employed, but after her sanity is lost she routinely is interrupted mid-coitus by psychedelic <b>bad</b> <b>trips</b> in which she visualizes a balding, half-naked old man clutching wads of cash {{in one hand and}} a bunch of bananas in the other. These psychotic episodes cause her to murder her partners by stabbing them with a screwdriver and dismembering them with a rusty meat cleaver (or in one case, a garden hoe) while imagining that she is cutting up cantaloupes and watermelons.|$|E
5000|$|Concert {{production}} was handled by Concert 10, Inc. [...] First time concert producers Irving Reiss, {{vice president of}} the Candygram Company, and attorney George Charak put US$250,000 in escrow to avoid problems paying the artists faced by previous festivals. [...] 66 people were hired from Bill Graham's road crew in Dallas to maintain the sound reinforcement system. 300 security people backed by University karate clubs maintained order, and the raceway's hospital was staffed by six physicians and eight nurses. 65 people from the Lackawanna County Drug Council were on site to handle adverse drug reactions (<b>bad</b> <b>trips)</b> from recreational drug users.
