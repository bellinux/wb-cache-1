60|$|When I {{came to my}} raft, I {{brought my}} effects on shore, which work spent that day entirely; and fearing that some cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I slept, I made a kind of hut or {{barricade}} with the chests and boards I had brought onshore. That night I slept very comfortably; {{and the next morning}} my thoughts were employed to make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away what necessaries I could find, before another storm should break her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and prepared a second raft far more nice then the first, upon which I brought away the carpenter's stores, two or three bags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took away several things that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, two <b>barels</b> of musket-bullets, another fowling-piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large bagful of small shot. Besides these, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a spare fore topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and thus completing my second cargo, I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild beast might destroy what I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me or the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of biscuit, which she instantly ate, and departed.|$|R
