They have small, beady eyes with brown irises {{on either side of}} their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a <b>blue</b> <b>haze,</b> which is corneal cloudiness thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} where the name [...] "gammon" [...] comes from. Warren Bonython {{has a number of}} suggestions: it might be [...] "gammon" [...] the verb meaning [...] "hoax" [...] in {{reference}} to the thick scrub on the ranges (he notes an area near Adelaide called 'Humbug Scrub' as precedent). He settles for the meaning of gammon as a piece of bacon, saying that Gammon Hill does, under [...] "certain conditions", look like a piece of bacon. Hearsay claims the Blue Range is named for the fact that, its immediate surrounds being so rugged, it's usually seen as a <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> in the distance! ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{performance}} of the show was Kwan with [...] "10,000 Light Years". The song is a hip-hop/pop song which the group performed in black outfits. Fire, light and pyrotechnics was used frequently on stage for visual presentation. Second on stage was Riikka, performing [...] "Meren" [...] (The sea). The song is an ethnic piece, performed in a <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> on stage. Riikka, {{dressed in a black}} and white dress, is joined by five female backing singers, all in black. Next on stage was Tapani Kansa, performing [...] "Rakkautta on, rauhaa ei" [...] (There's love, there's no peace). The song is a ballad, which Kansa performs in a black, and he is joined on stage by five female backing singers in white. During the start of his performance, however, Kansa loses his cue and stops singing, however he starts again shortly afterwards. The final {{performance of}} the night came from Tiara, who performs [...] "Manala" [...] (Underworld). The song is a rock number, which Tiara performs in a black and red dress. She is joined on stage by a three-man band and two female backing singers, all in black.|$|E
60|$|THE trail led along a {{gigantic}} fissure {{in the side}} of the crater, and then down and down into a red-walled, <b>blue</b> <b>hazed</b> labyrinth.|$|R
60|$|The earth {{seemed to}} Miss Cynthia to laugh out in prodigal joyousness on the {{afternoon}} she drove home when Wilbur had been pronounced out of danger. How tranquil the hills looked, with warm October sunshine sleeping on their sides and faint <b>blue</b> <b>hazes</b> on their brows! How gallantly the maples flaunted their crimson flags! How kind and friendly was every face she met! Afterwards, Miss Cynthia said she began to live that day.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{the hours}} passed. As the sun climbed the clear, steely lights vanished, the <b>blue</b> <b>hazes</b> deepened, and slowly the glistening {{surfaces}} of lava turned redder. Ladd was concerned {{to discover that}} Yaqui was missing from his outlook upon the high point. Jim Lash {{came out of the}} shady crevice, and stood up to buckle on his cartridge belt. His narrow, gray glance slowly roved from the height of lava down along the slope, paused in doubt, and then swept on to resurvey the whole vast eastern dip of the plateau.|$|R

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Anne softly, [...] "that 'the {{land where}} dreams come true' {{is in the}} <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> yonder, over that little valley." ...|$|E

60|$|But an August afternoon, with <b>blue</b> <b>hazes</b> {{scarfing}} {{the harvest}} slopes, little winds whispering elfishly in the poplars, and a dancing slendor of red poppies outflaming {{against the dark}} coppice of young firs {{in a corner of}} the cherry orchard, was fitter for dreams than dead languages. The Virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground, and Anne, her chin propped on her clasped hands, and her eyes on the splendid mass of fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over Mr. J. A. Harrison's house like a great white mountain, was far away in a delicious world where a certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work, shaping the destinies of future statesmen, and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high and lofty ambitions.|$|R
50|$|Ooty is {{situated}} in the Nilgiri hills. The name meaning blue mountains in Tamil and most other Indian languages might have arisen from the <b>blue</b> smoky <b>haze</b> given off by the eucalyptus trees that cover the area or from the Kurunji flower, which blooms every twelve years and gives the slopes a bluish tinge. Because of the mountains and green valleys, Ooty {{became known as the}} Queen of Hill Stations.|$|R
5000|$|... "Her exquisitely {{beautiful}} woolens are {{a thrilling}} sight," [...] wrote the Chicago Tribune. [...] "She weaves with {{the skill of}} a composer of symphonies, with the imagination of an artist trying to capture a misty <b>blue</b> morning <b>haze,</b> and with the integrity of a completely honest person. All are reflected in her incomparable fabrics, the very breath of the American scene and way of life. … Her soft tones in checks or the bold stripes and plaids are what make American clothes the tops of any in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was so gently warm and dim. Red {{roofs of the}} cottages burned among the <b>blue</b> <b>haze.</b> He loved the day. He could feel, {{but he could not}} understand, what Clara was saying.|$|E
60|$|Hare recoiled with a shock. Snap Naab swayed to the door, {{and stepped}} down, {{all the time}} with his face over his shoulder, his baleful glance on Hare; then the <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> {{swallowed}} him.|$|E
60|$|The short African {{twilight}} had come, {{a kind of}} soft <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> {{that made}} the ship look mysterious and unnatural. By degrees their conversation died away. They lapsed into a silence, which Alan {{was the first to}} break.|$|E

[p.9]of {{industry}} {{which kept}} us at anchor off the Isle of Wight, through the loveliest {{air of the}} Inland Sea, whose sparkling <b>blue</b> and purple <b>haze</b> spread charms even on N. Africa's beldame features, {{and now we are}} sitting silent and still, listening to the monotonous melody of the East-the soft night-breeze wandering through starlit skies and tufted trees, with a voice of melancholy meaning.|$|R
60|$|The {{interior}} was shadowy with a peculiar shade. The strange luminous semi-opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into Rembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes and {{divisions in the}} canvas, and spirted like jets of gold-dust across the dusky <b>blue</b> atmosphere of <b>haze</b> pervading the tent, until they alighted on inner surfaces of cloth opposite, and shone like little lamps suspended there.|$|R
60|$|At {{the last}} moment some extra {{supplies}} had come on board, and these were still awaiting proper distribution. The boys watched land slowly disappear in the <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> of distance, and then set to work to assist in making everything ship-shape.|$|E
60|$|The gorge lay {{asleep in}} the westering sun, silent, full of <b>blue</b> <b>haze.</b> Seen from this height, far above the break where the {{engineers}} had first halted, it had the dignity and dimensions of a canon. Its walls had begun to change color in the sunset light.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was setting}} over Rainbow Valley. The pond was wearing a {{wonderful}} tissue of purple and gold and green and crimson. A faint <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> rested on the eastern hill, over which a great, pale, round moon was just floating up like a silver bubble.|$|E
60|$|After the sear {{and lifeless}} {{color of the}} fields and forests, what a welcome relief to Daren Lane were the freshened green, the dawning red, the tinging gold! The forest on the hill was soft and warm, and but for the gleams of autumn, would have showed some of the {{tenderness}} of spring. Down in the lowlands a sea of color waved under a <b>blue,</b> smoky, melancholy <b>haze.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{the evening}} before last we had a {{gorgeous}} Arizona riot in the west. Bastioned upon the ocean cloud-tier was piled upon cloud-tier, spacious and lofty, until we gazed upon a Grand Canyon a myriad times vaster and more celestial {{than that of the}} Colorado. The clouds took on the same stratified, serrated, rose-rock formation, and all the hollows were filled with the opal <b>blues</b> and purple <b>hazes</b> of the Painted Lands.|$|R
60|$|I remounted Target, and {{the three}} men caught horses and climbed up bareback. Bill led {{the way across the}} glade, up the slope, into the level forest. There we broke into a gallop. The air upon this higher ground was dark and thick, but not so hard to breathe as that lower down. We pressed on. For a while the roar receded, and almost deadened. Then it grew clearer again' filled out, and swelled. Bud wanted to sheer off to the left. Herky swore we were being surrounded. Bill turned a deaf ear to them. From my own sense of {{direction}} I fancied we were going wrong, but Bill was so cool he gave me courage. Soon a <b>blue,</b> windy <b>haze,</b> shrouding the giant pines ahead, caused Bill to change his course.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look at the colours of that Foreland!' cried Claude. 'The simple {{monotone}} of pearly green, {{broken only}} at intervals by blood-red stains, where the turf has slipped {{and left the}} fresh rock bare, and all glimmering softly through a delicate <b>blue</b> <b>haze,</b> like the bloom on a half-ripened plum!' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} top was gained, and he looked around eagerly. At first only the plain far below met his view, but {{presently}} he made out a spot which he knew must be the fort. But all was in a <b>blue</b> <b>haze,</b> and no details could be distinguished.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} on the veranda steps, with her knees crossed and her chin resting on her hands. The air was heavy with the perfume of the grapes and the smell of late flowers from the sunken garden near by. A <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> hung over the Illinois shore.|$|E
6000|$|He {{watched her}} pretty and {{unconscious}} munching through the skeins of smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine, as she innocently {{looked down at}} the roses in her bosom, that there behind the <b>blue</b> narcotic <b>haze</b> was potentially the [...] "tragic mischief" [...] of her drama--one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the spectrum of her young life. She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now; and it was this that caused Alec d'Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fulness of growth, which made her appear more of a woman than she really was. She had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it denoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally, till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{initially}} {{being planned}} to be released for November 21, 2011 it was instead released the next day on November 22. To accompany the release of both physical and digital copies of the extended play the band uploaded the entire EP onto their Facebook profile for streaming. The physical release of the EP came in both Compact Disc form and 12” vinyl. The vinyl release came in two variations; with a limited to 100 copies colour combination of yellow with black haze and the commonly distributed version transparent <b>blue</b> with white <b>haze.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood in}} the midst of the botanical garden, and, with almost triumphant satisfaction, prognosticated that now there would be regret that Louis's schemes had been {{neglected}} or sneered at, and when too late, his father might feel as much sorrow as he had time for. It was the bitterness, not the softness of grief, in which he looked forth into the dull <b>blue</b> east-windy <b>haze</b> deepening in the twilight, and presently beheld something dark moving along under the orchard bank beneath. 'Hollo! who's there?' he exclaimed, and the form, rearing itself, disclosed young Madison, never a favourite with him, and though, as a persecuted protege of Louis, having claims which at another time might have softened him, coming forward at an unlucky moment, when his irritation only wanted an object on which to discharge itself. It was plain that one who came skulking in the private grounds could intend no good, and James greeted him, harshly, with 'You've no business here!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} {{everything}} {{in life is}} slipping away from me," [...] he protested. [...] "I ought to be thinking over what lam {{going to say to}} your country people, and instead of that I am wondering whether there is anything more beautiful in the world than the <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> over your meadows." ...|$|E
60|$|Bostil {{sat on his}} porch, a {{stricken}} man. He {{faced the}} <b>blue</b> <b>haze</b> of the north, where days before all that he had loved had vanished. Every day, from sunrise till sunset, he had been there, waiting and watching. His riders were grouped near him, silent, awed by his agony, awaiting orders that never came.|$|E

60|$|So Fulk had the one {{comfort of}} being with her {{when he was out}} of the sick room. I used to see them from the window walking up and down the terrace in the <b>blue</b> east wind <b>haze</b> of those March days, never that I could see speaking. I don't think my brother would have felt it honourable to tie one {{additional}} link between himself and her. He had not a doubt as to how her mother would act, but to be in her dear little affectionate presence was a better help than we could give him, even though nothing passed between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You and Ingleside seem strangely near me tonight. It's {{the first}} time I've felt this since I came. Always home has seemed so far away--so hopelessly far away from this hideous welter of filth and blood. But tonight it is quite close to me--it seems to me I can almost see you--hear you speak. And I can see the {{moonlight}} shining white and still on the old hills of home. It has seemed to me ever since I came here {{that it was impossible}} that there could be calm gentle nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world. But tonight somehow, all the beautiful things I have always loved seem to have become possible again--and this is good, and makes me feel a deep, certain, exquisite happiness. It must be autumn at home now--the harbour is a-dream and the old Glen hills <b>blue</b> with <b>haze,</b> and Rainbow Valley a haunt of delight with wild asters blowing all over it--our old [...] "farewell-summers." [...] I always liked that name better than 'aster'--it was a poem in itself.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941 it had become {{apparent}} that Dark Gray (5-D) was unacceptably visible under all conditions, and the [...] "conversion" [...] 5-D made from prewar #5 was also too glossy and prone to chipping and peeling; meanwhile Pacific Fleet experiments with new colors Sea Blue and Sapphire Blue were deemed successful. Accordingly, in July–August Dark Gray was discontinued and new paint formulas Sea <b>Blue</b> (5-S) and <b>Haze</b> Gray (5-H) were implemented, together with Deck Blue (20-B) for all horizontals, steel and wood alike. The tinting paste was altered to contain somewhat less black and more blue than before; this meant that Ocean Gray also became somewhat more bluish in cast at this time and all the 5-series paint colors now were categorized as Munsell 5 Purple-Blue. Until 1945 all USN [...] "gray" [...] and almost all [...] "blue" [...] shades were produced using this same blue-black tint (5-TMa), so that the paints represented different tones of what was effectively a single blue-gray hue.|$|R
