50|$|<b>Bit</b> <b>banging</b> is a {{technique}} for serial communications using software instead of dedicated hardware. Software directly sets and samples the state of pins on the microcontroller, and is responsible for all parameters of the signal: timing, levels, synchronization, etc. In contrast to <b>bit</b> <b>banging,</b> dedicated hardware (such as a modem, UART, or shift register) handles these parameters and provides a (buffered) data interface in other systems, so software {{is not required to}} perform signal demodulation. <b>Bit</b> <b>banging</b> can be implemented at very low cost, and is used in, for example, embedded systems.|$|R

A total of 24 students from five Aalto University Schools participated in this two-semester course. The course focused on global competition for leadership in innovation, policy-making, technology, and science and education. The fundamental objective of the <b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> courses is to teach the students teamwork, multidisciplinary collaboration and scenario building, {{as well as provide}} the students with global perspective, and industry and business foresight. In addition to normal class activities the students worked in six person teams to study local and global strategies to strive for success. This joint publication contains the final reports of the teamwork assignments. In the chapters the students seek answers to what makes the difference between the leaders and the followers. The topics include e. g. the potential of additive manufacturing for bringing manufacturing industries back to Western countries, the link between national higher education systems and innovation capability at the nation level, and changing governmental structures to better match contemporary challenges.

40|$|<b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> – Future of the Internet: Societal, business, {{governance}} and technological aspects {{was the fourth}} multidisciplinary post-graduate course for doctoral students at Aalto University. Altogether 24 students were selected from five Aalto University Schools: School of Arts, Design and Architecture; School of Economics; School of Electrical Engineering; School of Engineering; and School of Science. <b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> {{is part of the}} MIDE (Multidisciplinary Institute of Digitalisation and Energy) research program, which the Helsinki University of Technology started as part of its centennial celebration of university education and research. Professor Yrjö Neuvo, MIDE program leader, Nokia’s former Chief Technology Ofﬁcer, is the force behind this course. The essential learning aims of the course were teamwork, multidisciplinary collaboration, global perspective, industry and business foresight, and scenario building. The passing the <b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> course required active attendance at the lectures and seminars as well as writing this joint publication based on the autumn and spring group works. The texts were written by doctoral students presenting their views. During the academic year 2011 – 2012, the doctoral students discussed the societal, business, {{governance and}} technological phenomena that might affect the future development of the Internet. During the autumn semester, the students produced reports on the following four topics: Are We All Criminals?, Back to the Future – Prediction of incremental and disruptive innovations, From Democratizing Innovation to Innovating Democracy, and Proliferation of the Crowdsourcing Phenomenon. The textbooks for the autumn semester were the previous <b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> publications (I-III) and Wireless Foresight – Scenarios of the mobile world in 2015 by Bo Karlson et al. (2003). Distinguished guest lecturers from industry and academia complemented the textbook material. The spring teamwork topics were: Internet, Find Me a Job!, Gamification of Life: The rise of gaming and its effects on society, How to Control the Internet? – A complexity perspective, and Education Reloaded: From Socrates to Udacity. The textbook for the spring semester was Born Digital – Understanding the first generation of digital natives by John Palfrey and Urs Gasser (2008). In addition to the lectures and textbooks, the <b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> group made an intensive study tour to Tokyo, Japan. To complement the themes discussed in the reports, the groups also produced short scenarios of the future in the 2020 s. As a result, the second part of this book introduces four scenarios – Internet, find me a cure; High Tech Nationalism; Internet Kindergarten; and Trader’s Network – with innovative and eye-opening approaches to the future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of two dual and emergent sets of three irreversible bi-vectors- dubbed the TauQuernions τi, τj, τk- that are otherwise isomorphic to quaternions. This inherently dissipative 3 -dimensional tauquernion space is a subspace of the geometric (Cli ord) algebra G 4, 0 with generators {a, b, c, d}; a straightforward mapping produces a 3 + 1 dimensional sub-space with signature (+ − −−) in G 5, 0. The individual tauquernions are entanglement operators corresponding to the quantum mechanical Bell and Magic operators. The form τi + τj + τk has 64 sign variants of which 16 are nilpotent, which latter we identify with the Higgs boson; the other 48 variants square to the unitary 4 -vector ±abcd, which we identify as the carrier of mass. A natural candidate for dark matter also emerges, which we analyze. We calculate the information content of these and related forms, draw an exact map of the entropic pathways an expansion will follow, and sketch how this <b>Bit</b> <b>Bang</b> develops. Photons are clearly represented and transparently intertwined in the space, so one can expect overall compatibility with relativity theory...|$|E

50|$|Some computers, {{such as the}} IBM PC, use an {{integrated}} circuit called a UART. This IC converts characters to and from asynchronous serial form, implementing the timing and framing of data in hardware. Very low-cost systems, such as some early home computers, would instead use the CPU to send the data through an output pin, using the <b>bit</b> <b>banging</b> technique. Before large-scale integration (LSI) UART integrated circuits were common, a minicomputer or microcomputer would have a serial port made of multiple small-scale integrated circuits to implement shift registers, logic gates, counters, {{and all the other}} logic for a serial port.|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} whether to deploy <b>bit</b> <b>banging</b> {{or not is}} a trade-off between load, performance and reliability on the one hand, {{and the availability of}} a hardware alternative on the other. The software emulation process consumes more processing power than does supporting dedicated hardware. The microcontroller spends much of its time sending or receiving samples to and from the pins, {{at the expense of other}} tasks. The signal produced usually has more jitter or glitches, especially if the processor is also executing other tasks while communicating. However, if the bit-banging software is interrupt-driven by the signal, this may be of minor importance, especially if control signals such as RTS, CTS, or DCD are available. The implementation in software can be a solution when specific hardware support is not available or requires a more expensive microcontroller.|$|R

It also significantly low-ers the ease with which software can be developed and maintained. Flat code is signifi-cantly larger in size compared to code that has been structured into procedures. This can be extremely important in embedded systems where code memory is at a premium. This thesis presents a novel application of the traditional compiler optimization tech-niques- procedure inlining and procedure cloning, to remove the constraints on proce-dure calls with ASTI. Under the assumption that the system cannot tolerate the inlining of all procedure calls, this thesis provides an algorithmic approach to choosing some subset of calls to inline and to remove the timing conflicts in the remaining procedures in the most optimal fashion...|$|R
