5|$|All serpins share {{a common}} {{structure}} (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three β-sheets (named A, B and C) and eight or nine α-helices (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive centre loop (RCL). The A-sheet includes two β-strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the 'shutter', and upper region called the 'breach'. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have <b>been</b> <b>solved</b> showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins {{are thought to be}} in dynamic equilibrium between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary interactions {{with the rest of the}} structure, and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.|$|E

5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day.

5|$|Many camouflaged textile {{patterns}} {{have been}} developed to suit the need to match combat clothing to different kinds of terrain (such as woodland, snow, and desert). The design of a pattern effective in all terrains has proved elusive. The American Universal Camouflage Pattern of 2004 attempted to suit all environments, but was withdrawn after a few years of service. Terrain-specific patterns have sometimes been developed but are ineffective in other terrains. The problem of making a pattern that works at different ranges has <b>been</b> <b>solved</b> with pixellated shapes, often designed digitally, that provide a fractal-like range of patch sizes so they appear disruptively coloured both at close range and at a distance. The first genuinely digital camouflage pattern was the Canadian CADPAT, issued to the army in 2002, soon followed by the American MARPAT. A pixellated appearance is not essential for this effect, though it is simpler to design and to print.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not <b>been</b> <b>solved</b> because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have <b>been</b> <b>solved.</b> In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E

5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode.

5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had <b>been</b> <b>solved</b> by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration.

Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them.
