DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Optospectroscopic {{analysis of a}} <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> in fluids, comprises: fixing the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> in a sample holding unit; categorizing the particles that are optionally contained in the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> based on {{an analysis of the}} image data from the microscopic photographs of the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> and/or the particles-contained in it, and analyzing the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> within a measurement zone that can be positioned in the region of the <b>biological</b> <b>sample,</b> by Raman spectroscopic method. Based on the results of the categorization procedure, the measurement zone is automatically positioned at defined sections or particles of the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> and the Raman spectroscopic analysis is confined to the region of this measurement zone. The fixing of the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> takes place by allowing the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> to flow through the sample holding unit, which is designed as a fluid cell, where the particles optionally contained in the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> are retained in the fluid cell and are fixed there reversibly, at least {{for the duration of the}} analysis. The particles are retained in the fluid cell by at least a single perforated plate with many holes that is arranged in the fluid cell and the holes in the perforated plate are arranged in rows and columns and structured in the form of a regular and implementable pattern. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for optospectroscopic analysis of <b>biological</b> <b>samples,</b> comprising: sample holding unit for the local fixation of the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> in a measurement zone; excitation radiation unit, suitable for excitation of Raman scattered radiation by excitation radiation in an excitation zone within the measuring zone; and analysis unit, suitable for the spectral analysis of the Raman scattered radiation emitted by the <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> in the excitation zone, where: the sample holding unit is a fluid cell that can be flowed through by the biological sample; the fluid cell exhibits an instrument that are suitable for retention and temporary reversible fixation of the particles contained in the biological sample; the fluid cell exhibits at least a first perforated plate with several holes with a first diameter as the retention part for holding back the particles, and the holes in the perforated plate are arranged in the perforated plate in rows and columns and structured in the form of a regular and implementable pattern.
