2500|$|According to {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Jerry Lee Lewis, [...] "there were only four true American originals: Al Jolson, Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, and Jerry Lee Lewis."

2500|$|I {{think we}} were fairly smart with [...] "Spoonman" [...] in that you really don't see us that much in the video. You see various {{pictures}} of us, but it's {{not quite the same}} as having us in your living room all the time. We're trying to maintain some degree of mystique about Soundgarden, I guess. I remember <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid, long before MTV, {{and the only way to}} see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts. It was an incredible experience. MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that I felt as though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. <b>Back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

60|$|I {{got as far}} as Belmont, on {{the main}} road <b>back,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> robbed of my horse-meat by three militiamen. There was no change in the situation, they said, except that it was going from bad to worse. The I.L.W. had plenty of {{provisions}} hidden away and could last out for months. I managed to get as far as Baden, when my horse was taken away from me by a dozen men. Two of them were San Francisco policemen, and the remainder were regular soldiers. This was ominous. The situation was certainly extreme when the regulars were beginning to desert. When I continued my way on foot, they already had the fire started, and the last of Dakon's horses lay slaughtered on the ground.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--My {{sense of}} disgrace does not abate. It grows.

60|$|Yes, it {{is strange}} how little a while {{at a time}} a person can be contented. Only a little while <b>back,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> riding and suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet {{serenity}} in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed, where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet already I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not light my pipe--for, although I had long ago started a match factory, I had forgotten to bring matches with me--and partly because we had nothing to eat. Here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and people. A man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey, {{and would have been}} scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear. There was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff. And yet there could not be anything more sensible. It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.|$|E

"To my {{surprise}} he demurred {{very much to}} the suggestion, and he explained that according to his religion it was an all-important matter that the body should be reunited after death, and so make a perfect dwelling for the spirit. The belief is, of course, an old one, and the mummies of the Egyptians arose from an analogous superstition. I answered him that his hand was already off, and {{asked him how he}} intended to preserve it. He replied that he would pickle it in salt and carry it about with him. I suggested that it might be safer in my keeping than his, and that I had better means than salt for preserving it. On realising that I really intended to carefully keep it, his opposition vanished instantly. 'But remember, sahib,' said he, 'I shall want it <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dead.' <b>I</b> laughed at the remark, and so the matter ended. I returned to my practice, and he no doubt in the course of time was able to continue his journey to Afghanistan.|$|R
