5|$|The long-awaited {{excavation}} {{began on}} 29 September 2004, led <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of archaeologists and dedicated archaeology volunteers called Southeast Asian Archaeology. Nearly 2 metres down, the volunteers uncovered significant {{remains of the}} fort still in situ—a pair of infantry bastions that did {{not appear in the}} original plans, the perimeter of the moat's inner escarpment and {{what appears to be the}} drawbridge superstructure. Experts call it Singapore's only 'true fort'—one with protection all around—and it was considered one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds.|$|E

5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism.

5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} {{in a direct}} line from previous kings, as {{would be the case}} in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E

5|$|Long ago, the {{continent}} of Archanea was invaded by the Dolhr Empire, led by the Shadow Dragon Medeus. Anri, a youth from Altea, defeated the Shadow Dragon using the divine sword Falchion. The Kingdom of Archanea was restored and the world entered an age of peace. However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by the evil wizard Gharnef, who has conquered the mage-state of Khadein. The two form an alliance with the kingdoms of Macedon and Grust in order to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter Elice {{in the care of}} a bastion manned by Altea's ally, Gra. However, Gra betrays Altea to Dolhr; Cornelius is killed, Falchion is stolen, and Elice sacrifices herself so Marth can escape.
