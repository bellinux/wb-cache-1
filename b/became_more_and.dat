5|$|Mkhedruli <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more {{dominant}} {{over the two}} other scripts, though Khutsuri (Nuskhuri with Asomtavruli) was used until the 19th century. Mkhedruli became the universal writing Georgian system outside of the Church in the 19th century with the establishment and development of printed Georgian fonts.|$|E
50|$|Feature {{detectors}} are individual neurons—or {{groups of}} neurons—in the brain which code for perceptually significant stimuli.

5|$|Ochs's {{drinking}} <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> {{more of a}} problem, and {{his behavior}} became increasingly erratic.

5|$|The Turkish {{army was}} at first {{quartered}} in Baghdad, but quickly came into conflict with {{the remnants of the}} old Abbasid establishment in the city and the city's populace. The latter resented their loss of influence and career opportunities to the foreign troops, who were furthermore often undisciplined and violent, spoke no Arabic, and were either recent converts to Islam or still pagans. Violent episodes between the populace and the Turks thus <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more common.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Drusus {{elevated}} Sejanus, {{at least in}} Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD26, Sejanus was left {{in charge of the}} entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, Manchester Phoenix {{were granted}} {{planning}} permission {{to construct a}} new rink in Altrincham. A few weeks later Cardiff Devils also received planning permission {{for the construction of}} a new rink. The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide a new facility proved successful. With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season, speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace London Racers. After the season was over, rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more widespread. On 22 June 2006, Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base {{at the end of}} June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{eliminate}} many conventional weapons, {{and defend the}} Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that unless this occurred, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve. In 1955, Khrushchev abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack. In January 1960, Khrushchev took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third {{in the size of}} Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops. While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more common, especially for students.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Poland's {{economy was}} in shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public unrest, and the {{government}} {{was unable to find}} a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis. Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centered around former members of the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization as well as some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms {{went out of business}} due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were {{dominated}} by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more impractical, especially {{after the turn of the}} 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively— often by locking out workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while the rest was apportioned among the local unions.|$|E

5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also {{an expression of the}} theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E
5|$|Wellington's Spanish liaison officer, Miguel Ricardo de Álava y Esquivel, {{was hit by}} a spent bullet {{during the}} advance. As Wellington was teasing Álava, he was knocked off his horse when a bullet-sized {{canister}} shot struck his sword hilt. In pain from a badly bruised hip, the British army commander remounted and continued to direct the battle. At this time, Soult realized that Hill's column might cut off his army from the Orthez to Sault-de-Navailles road. He ordered his army to retreat, covered by Villatte, Darmagnac, Rouget and Paris. At first, the tricky withdrawal was conducted in good order, though it was closely followed by British horse artillery and infantry. Because they had to retreat on narrow paths and across country, the retreating French units became badly mixed and unit cohesion was lost. Fearful of capture, the retreating soldiers <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more confused and demoralized.|$|E

5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests in Europe and in the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more a formality until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version {{there would be more}} mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
