The temporary increase in the bottom G-tetrad gate area between 111.64 ns and 136.59 ns corresponded to the inward tilt of G 5 and G 11 bases, the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds between G 5 and G 11 bases destroyed in this period, so the structures were instable and reverted to the common form.

40|$|Precipitation of {{sulphate}} crystals in discontinuities due to evaporation of sulphate solutions is {{an important}} contribution to the degradation and swelling behavior of sulphate bearing argillaceous rocks. Although the phenomenon has been studied in laboratory during decades linked to the expansive behavior in tunnels, tests do not adequately reproduce field conditions and all variables involved in the swelling mechanism. Size effect problems and the difficulty in correctly applying hydraulic boundary conditions are the main aspects behind these experimental difficulties. To this aim, a new experimental setup has been designed to allow applying relative humidity control on the top cap of the sample, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>cap</b> is in permanent contact with a saturated sulphate solution. This way, controlled solvent evaporation conditions are applied, which control the rate of sulphate precipitation on the sample.

Reported herein are the results of laboratory air,fatigue crack growth tests and 95 % relative humidity SCC tests conducted using specimens machined from the C 5 A,forging. SCC test results revealed that the C 5 A,forging material was susceptible to intergranular environmental assisted cracking: the C 5 A forging material exhibited a SCC crack-tip stress-intensity factor threshold of less than 6 MPadn. Fracture toughness tests revealed that the C 5 A forging material exhibited a fracture toughness that was 25 % less than the C 5 B forging. The C 5 A forging exhibited rapid laboratory air fatigue crack growth rates having a threshold crack-tip stress-intensity factor range of less than 0. 8 MPa sup m. Detailed fractographic examinations revealed that the,fatigue crack intergranular growth crack path was similar to the cracking observed in the C 5 A tie box forging.

40|$|One-dimensional (1 D) TiO 2 {{nanomaterials}} with ordered structure {{have been}} extensively applied in various fields, such as photocatalysts, solar cells, supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries, {{due to the}} unique structural and functional properties compared to the disordered nanoparticulate forms. Nevertheless, intrinsic disadvantages of TiO 2, such as its large band gap (~ 3 eV), fast recombination rate of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and insufficient ionic conductivity, severely limit the development of 1 D TiO 2 nanomaterials for practical applications. To address the above issues, {{the scope of this}} thesis focus on the fundamental understandings of the electronic structure of highly ordered TiO 2 nanostructures upon the anatase-to-rutile solid phase transition, anion doping, noble metal decoration and sodium ion intercalation, using synchrotron based X-ray absorption, emission and related microscopy and spectroscopies. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) in combination with scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is used to track the rutile nucleation site and the associated rutile growth behavior of 1 D TiO 2 nanostructure. It is found that the <b>bottom</b> <b>cap</b> layer with its defective nature requires a lower thermal energy for rutile nucleation, and the growth of a dense rutile structure proceeds from the bottom to the top at the expense of nanostructured anatase TiO 2. The unzipping of the top nanotube into nanograss structure can further stabilize the anatase phase structure. To increase the photoabsorption and photoperformance of TiO 2, N-doped and Pd-decorated TiO 2 nanotubes are prepared. On one hand, a TiO 2 -x anatase core warped by a Ti 4 O 7 amorphous shell structure is achieved by N doping. The synergy for extraordinary photoabsorption established by this newly core-shell structure is revealed by XANES and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). On the other hand, the electronic and optical properties of Pd/TiO 2 Schottky heterojunction have been thoroughly investigated using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) and RIXS to elucidate its enhanced photoactivity. Finally, amorphous and anatase TiO 2 nanotubes are comparatively studied for accommodating the sodium ion, of which XANES with its element and site specificities is applied to track the local effect of sodium uptake/release in TiO 2 nanotubes...|$|E
30|$|PAA Researchers have {{realized}} {{the value of}} ultrasmall nanopores and have tried to fabricate them. Some studies just obtained very thin layers (thickness 10 – 100 nm) of ultrasmall nanopores. Lira et al. claimed 5 nm pore size by applying electrical pulses at end of general PAA fabrication process [10]. According to the related SEM images, the claimed PAA layer is around 100 nm in thickness and the nanopores are not parallel to each other. Actually, {{it is a new}} approach or a necessary step to open or remove the barrier layer. Kokonou et al. presented the fabrication of ultrasmall nanopores (5 – 10 nm) within ultrathin PAA layers (20 – 30 nm) in 6 % (v/v) sulfuric acid at 20 V and in 6 wt% oxalic acid at 30 V for just few minutes of anodization [11]. Xu et al. proposed an expensive way of ion-milling the U-shaped <b>bottom</b> <b>cap</b> of the alumina nanochannel to obtain nanopore with a diameter as 10 nm [12], but the barrier layer was only 40 nm in thickness. Some researchers employed pretexturing techniques to obtain ultrasmall nanopores. Masuda et al. used a 2 D Fe 2 O 3 monodisperse nanoparticles as a template to leave a concave array on aluminum foil to obtain PAA with 13 -nm pore intervals [13]. Asoh et al. fabricated highly ordered PAA films with 15 nm pore diameter by pretexturing Al with SiC mold and anodizing in 0.3 M sulfuric acid under a constant voltage of 25 V at 17 °C [14]. Kim et al. employed much lower temperature of − 15 °C under 25 V in 0.3 M sulfuric acid to get PAAs with the pore diameter ~ 14 nm [15]. Ono et al. reported PAAs fabricated in different electrolytes at 2 – 40 V, and the pore diameter was claimed to be less than 10 nm by calculations according to the relationship between porosity and pore diameter [16]. In summary, pretexturing by metal, oxide or polymer [17] molds is workable to guide the growth the PAAs, but it is a complicated process, and it is also very difficult to get ultrasmall nanopores since it is hard to prepattern the surface with < 10 nm textures. And so far, there is no direct evidence to confirm the formation of 1 – 10 nm ultrasmall nanopores by simple two-step anodization.|$|E

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) {{has been}} {{evaluating}} technologies for removing radioactive cesium ({sup 137 }Cs) from the supernate solutions {{stored in the}} high-level waste tanks at the site. Crystalline silicotitanate (CST) sorbent (IONSIV IE- 911 {reg_sign}, UOP LLC, Des Plaines, IL), which is very effective at removing cesium from high-salt solutions, {{was one of three}} technologies that were tested. Because of the extremely high inventory of {sup 137 }Cs expected for the large columns of CST that would be used for treating the SRS supernate, any loss of flow or cooling to the columns could result in high temperatures from radiolytic heating. Also, even under normal operating conditions, the CST would be exposed to the supernates for up to a year before being removed. Small-scale batch and column tests conducted last year using samples of production batches of CST showed potential problems with CST clumping and loss of cesium capacity after extended contact with the simulant solutions. Similar tests-using samples of a baseline and improved granular CST and the CST powder used to make both granular samples-were performed this year to compare the performance of the improved CST. The column tests, which used recirculating supernate simulant, showed that the baseline CST generated more precipitates of sodium aluminosilicate than the improved CST. The precipitates were particularly evident in the tubing that carried the simulant solution to and from the column, but the baseline CST also showed higher concentrations of aluminum on the CST than were observed for the improved CST. Recirculating the simulant through just a section of the tubing (no contact with CST) also produced small amounts of precipitate, similar to the amounts seen for the improved CST column. The sodium aluminosilicate formed bridges between the CST granules, causing clumps of CST to form in the column. Clumps were visible in the baseline CST column after 1 month of operation and in the improved CST column after 2 months, For the baseline CST column, the clumps were routinely dispersed by backwashing the column with simulant. After 96 days of operation, a thin hard layer of CST formed on the bottom screen of the baseline column that restricted flow through the column. The <b>bottom</b> <b>cap</b> was removed and the CST was scraped from the screen to restore the column to normal operation. After 3 months of operation, the improved CST column was completely clumped together and could not be dispersed by backwashing. The pressure drop through the column was still relatively low, so the test was continued until the pressure drop increased to > 15 psig after 105 days of operation. The column was then disassembled, and the CST was physically removed from the column and broken up. These results show that both the baseline and improved CST, when contacted with the supernate simulant, have the potential for forming clumps that can restrict the flow through the small columns used in these tests. The cesium capacity of the CST samples from the column tests with recirculating simulant decreased slightly as the run time increased. Most of this decrease could be attributed to the weight of cancrinite (a sodium aluminosilicate) on the CST samples. Tests conducted last year using production batch samples of CST showed a more pronounced drop in cesium capacity under comparable conditions. A column test using the improved CST and once-through simulant showed few problems during 5 months of operation. The pressure drop through the column remained low; however, when the final samples were taken after 5 months of operations, the CST in the column had clumped together. The final sample taken from the top 1 cm of the column showed a 65 % drop in cesium capacity compared with all the other samples from this column. This sample also contained the highest concentration of cancrinite, but the weight of cancrinite could account for {{only a small fraction of}} the drop in cesium capacity by simple dilution of the CST. The CST in the batch tests stored at elevated temperatures in average simulant formed clumps, but this occurred at a slower rate than that observed last year during comparable tests using production batch samples of CST. Storage at elevated temperatures caused a gradual decrease in cesium capacity as the storage time increased, with a loss in capacity of up to 20 % after 5 to 6 months at 80 C. The results for the baseline and improved CST samples were essentially the same for these batch tests...|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. This report, Development of Preliminary Strut-Tie Models for Precast Bent Cap Connections (Cast-in-place and Grouted Duct), {{develops}} strut-tie models (STM) for precast bent cap-column connections {{using the}} NCHRP 12 - 74 Grouted Duct (GD) and Cast-in-Place (CIP) specimens. In {{development of these}} STM???s, the bent cap bar strains from the specimens were compared against three theoretical models: beam theory, 2 D strut-tie models, and 3 D strut-tie models. 	The beam theory analysis used statics, moment-curvature analysis, and actual material properties of the specimens to determine the theoretical bent cap bar strains. The 2 D STM, based on the modified external strut force transfer model (EFTM) proposed in the literature, was established using the computer aided strut-and-tie (CAST) program. Through an iterative process, a refined 2 D STM was developed for both the push and pull test directions by comparing specimen strain data to CAST output. An important modification to the EFTM-based STM was {{the addition of a}} tension tie at the <b>bottom</b> <b>cap</b> face (as tested) for the pull direction. This corresponded to tension strain present in test data and made the CAST model stable. Based on the 2 D STM, the 3 D STM was created in the SAP 2000 structural analysis program. The 3 D STM incorporates out-of-plane effects related to actual column bar positions and allows a more accurate representation of the two primary mechanisms assumed in anchoring column tension forces: clamping mechanism and splice transfer mechanism. 	The beam theory results included limited comparisons of actual-to-theoretical flexural strains for two locations adjacent to the joint, top vs. bottom bars, and CIP vs. GD specimens. The average percent differences of the actual to the theoretical strains for the CIP was 49 and 146 for the compression bar, 12 inches away from the cap face and at the cap face, respectively. Over the entire range of loading stages, differences in actual-to-theoretical strains were generally larger for locations closer to the joint, indicating a more pronounced local disturbance compared to locations further away from the joint. Bars that were in compression for most of the loading sequences exhibited a much closer match to theoretical strains than bars that were primarily subjected to tension. Local cracking and other effects are believed to have influenced gage readings. CIP and GD strains for the same locations generally displayed similar trends and values, especially for bars in compression. 	Compared to beam theory, results of the 2 D STM analysis indicated a closer correlation between actual and theoretical strain. The difference between actual and theoretical strains for the CIP specimen were limited to 28 percent and averaged approximately 16 percent for both push and pull directions. For the GD specimen, the differences were as large as 44 percent except for one location, which reached a 98 percent difference. On average, the differences averaged 27 percent in the push direction and the 45 percent in the pull direction. This increased accuracy reflects the more realistic representation of the flow of forces within a joint and their effects. 	The 3 D STM showed the closest correlation between the test data and theoretical analysis. Actual to theoretical strains for the 3 D STM???s differed by no more than 42 percent and only 14 percent on average. These values were smaller than for any other analytical method. The reason is because the 3 D mechanisms associated with anchoring the column tension force were more accurately detailed and accounted for in the 3 D model. 	Conclusions from these analyses include: 1) beam theory does not accurately represent strains that develop in longitudinal reinforcement at the face of CIP and precast bent cap joints; 2) the limit of the disturbed (D) region appears to extend a distance of approximately half of the bent cap depth (hb/ 2) {{from the face of the}} joint; 3) the developed 2 D STM, including the additional tension tie, provides a reasonably simple and accurate model for the flow of forces through a bent cap joint using CIP or GD connections; 4) the modified EFTM requires an additional tension tie in the pull direction to accurately represent tension that develops in the exterior face of bent caps; 5) the developed 3 D STM is the most complicated yet accurate model for analyzing joint forces and associated reinforcement strain in a CIP or precast bent cap joint; 6) the presence of ducts in the GD specimen did not noticeably affect specimen strain values compared to the CIP specimen nor affect the development or results of the 2 D or 3 D STM???s; and 7) analytical results from this study do not indicate the need for any changes to existing NCHRP 12 - 74 recommendations for non-integral precast bent caps using CIP or GD connections. 	Based on results of this analysis, the following are recommended for future study: 1) perform finite element analysis (FEA) of the CIP and GD specimens in the pull direction to confirm the need for the additional tension tie; 2) further develop the 2 D STM, with special focus on determination of strains in the joint hoops and joint stirrups (interior and exterior) and comparison to test data; 3) perform FEA for CIP and GD precast bent caps to validate the three splice transfer mechanisms and their impact on joint behavior; and 4) incorporate data from the CSUS Preliminary Grouted Duct specimen to supplement these analytical results.

30|$|The higher {{compressibility}} {{of smaller}} specimens during isotropic compression and drained shearing {{could be due}} to the larger volumetric fraction of the sand particles near the specimen’s sides. Additional compression of the latex and grease layers (at the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>caps)</b> associated with possible inaccuracies of the employed bedding error correction method (Sarsby et al. 1980; Russell and Khalili 2004) may have also contributed to the larger compressibility of the smaller specimens. Although no shear bands were observed {{at the end of the}} tests on the exterior surface of the specimens, as suggested by earlier studies (Tatsuoka et al. 1991; Desrues et al. 1996; Finno et al. 1996; Jang and Frost 2000; Alshibli and Sture 2000) it is quite possible that a complex and diffuse mode of failure and shear localization (involving multiple shear bands) developed in the specimens. The lower deviator stresses of the larger specimens (in Figs.  4 and 6) could be associated with the more intense strain-softening resulting from shearing along longer and larger number of shear bands formed in larger specimens and the differences in the available space or freedom for particle rearrangement in the specimens of different sizes. Similar mechanisms leading to specimen size effects have been also observed in compression tests (Andrews et al. 2001; Bastawros et al. 2000; Chen and Fleck 2002; Hakamada et al. 2007; Jeon and Asahina 2005; Park and Nutt 2001) and in numerical modeling studies (Chen and Fleck 2002; Onck et al. 2001; Tekoglu et al. 2011) of foam materials. While results from the current study are focused on a narrow set of very loose Drc (7 – 18  %), specimen size effect on the shear strength parameters can affect the design and analysis of many geotechnical applications and are explained in the following paragraphs.|$|R
