25|$|By the 1980s merengue was so <b>big</b> <b>it</b> {{was even}} beating out salsa on the airwaves. That decade was also notable for {{a boom in}} all-female orquestas, and Las Chicas del Can became {{particularly}} popular. Since then, musicians like Juan Luis Guerra, trained at Boston's Berklee school, Tono Rosario and former rocker Luis Díaz have brought merengue even further abroad, truly internationalizing the music. Guerra collaborated with African guitarists, experimented with indigenous Caribbean sounds, and explored Dominican roots music with típico accordionist Francisco Ulloa, while Díaz (an innovator since his work with 1970s folklore group Convite) fused merengue, rock, merengue típico, and bachata in his productions.|$|E

25|$|The {{prairie dog}} is well adapted to predators. Using its dichromatic color vision, it can detect predators {{from a great}} distance; it then alerts other prairie dogs of the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Constantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a {{sophisticated}} system of vocal communication to describe specific predators. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, how <b>big</b> <b>it</b> is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also writes that prairie dogs have calls for things that are not predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the other}} great boons to Australian heavy metal music was the Metal for the Brain festival. Established by Armoured Angel’s drummer Joel Green {{to raise funds for}} a friend {{severely}} brain-damaged after an assault, the first concert in 1991 featured six Canberra bands in the afternoon with a later performance by some punk bands including the Hard Ons. By the end of the decade, the event had stretched out to a 12-hour festival featuring 18 groups from around the country and by 2000 was so <b>big</b> <b>it</b> was forced to move to a larger venue. When the final Metal for the Brain festival closed in November 2006, more than 100 different bands from every major centre in Australia and several from overseas including Voivod had appeared at some time. Many bands considered it {{to be one of the}} pinnacles of their achievements.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too <b>big.</b> <b>It</b> is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} Jak 3, Naughty Dog assembled {{their most}} technically talented {{staff members and}} began development of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune under the codename <b>Big.</b> <b>It</b> was in full production for about two years, with a small team of engineers working on the game {{for about a year}} before hand. Naughty Dog decided to create a brand new IP rather than opt to develop a PlayStation 3 Jak and Daxter game—they wanted to create a franchise suitable for the new hardware, in order to develop such ideas as realistic human characters instead of stylized ones owing to limitations of previous hardware, as well as create something [...] "fresh and interesting", although termed as 'stylized realism'. Inspiration was drawn from various sources in the action and adventure genres: pulp magazines, movie serials, and more contemporary titles like Indiana Jones and National Treasure. The team felt the sources shared themes of mystery and [...] "what-if scenarios" [...] that romanticized adventure and aimed to include those in Uncharted.|$|E

And the film got so <b>big,</b> <b>it</b> was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things… it had to be bigger and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." [...] As Full Sequence was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make Full Sequence resemble a Disney film.

500|$|La Dispute {{recorded}} {{the remainder of}} the album in a month in StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. Dreyer wanted to give the album the most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give the album a synthesized quality. Joe Pedulla stated that he wanted to give the album a more raw and authentic sound: [...] "We were just trying to capture {{what it would be like}} for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room." [...] He also credited Dreyer's vocal range: [...] "Jordan Dreyer has this crazy dynamic range – a 20dB swing from how loud and quiet he gets. So there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all, where he's speaking/singing softly, the room is not echoing, and he sounds close and in-your-face. Then the dynamic swing happens, and we would see how <b>big</b> <b>it</b> can get." [...] When recording vocals, Dreyer makes very long takes, trying to emulate the sound of his voice in live performances. The album's recording features what the band considers [...] "auxiliary instrumentation", including trumpet and rhodes piano, and even improvised instruments that Sterenburg's brother created out of scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut is too <b>big</b> <b>it</b> will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers. They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the overall amount of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). For broaching to be effective, the workpiece should have [...] more material than the final dimension of the cut.|$|E
