5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established <b>bush</b> <b>should</b> not be allowed to become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. doesn't always follow {{international}} law. For example, {{some critics}} assert the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq {{was not a}} proper response to an imminent threat, but an act of aggression which violated international law. For example, Benjamin Ferencz, a chief prosecutor of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg said George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>should</b> be tried for war crimes along with Saddam Hussein for starting aggressive wars—Saddam for his 1990 attack on Kuwait and Bush for his 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|After just 100 {{hours of}} ground combat, {{and with all}} of Kuwait and much of {{southern}} Iraq under coalition control, US President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing <b>Bush</b> <b>should</b> have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; {{there is little doubt}} that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.|$|E

5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected <b>bushes</b> <b>should</b> be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|R

2500|$|Surveying [...] "the pardon battle" [...] and citing both {{pro and con}} publications, The Washington Post online {{columnist}} Dan Froomkin {{concludes that}} many U.S. newspapers opposed a presidential pardon for Libby. Much of this commentary obscured {{the fact that the}} clemency power provided the President with several options short of a full, unconditional pardon. In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, former federal prosecutor and conservative activist William Otis argued the sentence was too stringent and that, instead of pardoning Libby, <b>Bush</b> <b>should</b> commute his sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of January 17, 1991, allied forces {{launched}} the first attack, which included more than 4,000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft. This pace would continue for the next four weeks, until a ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991. Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward Kuwait City while {{on the west side of}} the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours. Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that <b>Bush</b> <b>should</b> have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power. Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have [...] "incurred incalculable human and political costs.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Crockford first {{specified}} and popularized the JSON format. The acronym originated at State Software (originally named Veil Networks, Inc.), {{a company}} co-founded by Crockford, Randy Farmer [...] (left {{to work at}} 3DO), Greg Macdonald, Chip Morningstar, Robert F. Napiltonia and Dominik Zynis in March 2001. State Software was funded by Tesla Ventures with $1.8 Million in October 2011, and tried to trademark the word [...] "State". [...] The co-founders agreed to build a system that used standard browser capabilities and provided an abstraction layer for Web developers to create stateful Web applications that had a persistent duplex connection to a Web server by holding two HTTP connections open and recycling them before standard browser time-outs if no further data were exchanged. The co-founders had a round-table discussion and voted whether to call the data format JSML or JSON, as well as under what license type to make it available. Crockford, being inspired by the words of then President <b>Bush,</b> <b>should</b> also be credited with {{coming up with the}} [...] "evil-doers" [...] JSON license ("The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.") in order to open-source the JSON libraries, but force (troll) corporate lawyers, or those who are overly pedantic, to seek to pay for a license from State. Morningstar developed the idea for the State Application Framework at State Software. On the other hand, this clause led to license compatibility problems of the JSON license with other open-source licenses.|$|E

Blueberry <b>bushes</b> <b>should</b> be planted {{only if they are}} approved by legitimate virus-testing programs, especially in areas where the virus has been reported. Other blueberry bushes that have already been infected should be identified by ELISA and destroyed completely so that they do not grow back and risk infecting other bushes. It is also recommended, since honeybees spread the virus, that all honeybee hives should not be placed anywhere near infected bushes.|$|R

Still, she had no intention of admitting it, and regarded him inquiringly with a half-contemptuous indifference which she had found especially effective with presumptuous young men in England.

60|$|Toiling {{and resting}} and toiling again, we wore away the morning; and about noon {{lay down in}} a thick bush of heather to sleep. Alan took the first watch; {{and it seemed to}} me I had scarce closed my eyes before I was shaken up to take the second. We had no clock to go by; and Alan stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead; so that as soon as the shadow of the <b>bush</b> <b>should</b> fall so far to the east, I might know to rouse him. But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept twelve hours at a stretch; I had the taste of sleep in my throat; my joints slept even when my mind was waking; the hot smell of the heather, and the drone of the wild bees, were like possets to me; and every now and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing.|$|E
50|$|The virus causing {{blackcurrant}} reversion {{is transmitted}} by Cecidophyopsis ribis. The characteristic leaf symptoms are {{a smaller number}} of leaf lobes and a {{decrease in the number of}} teeth on the serrated edge of the leaves. The flowers also show symptoms with the buds being less hairy than normal and, in a severe form of the disease present in Russia and Scandinavia, the sepals appearing to be doubled in number to ten. The vigor of the bush is reduced and fruit yields diminish. Although spread of the mite can be prevented to some extent, badly affected <b>bushes</b> <b>should</b> be destroyed and replaced with virus-free stock.|$|R

6000|$|She {{had said}} to herself betimes, in a general way, that {{whatever}} habits her youth might form, that of seeing an interested suitor in every <b>bush</b> <b>should</b> certainly never grow {{to be one of}} them--an attitude she had early judged as ignoble, as poisonous. She had had accordingly in fact as little to do with it as possible and she scarce knew why at the present moment she should have had to catch herself in the act of imputing an ugly motive. It didn't sit, the ugly motive, in Lord Mark's cool English eyes; the darker side of it at any rate showed, to her imagination, but briefly. Suspicion moreover, with this, simplified itself: there was a beautiful reason--indeed there were two--why her companion's motive shouldn't matter. One was that even should he desire her without a penny she wouldn't marry him for the world; the other was that she felt him, after all, perceptively, kindly, very pleasantly and humanly, concerned for her. They were also two things, his wishing to be well, to be very well, with her, and his beginning to feel her as threatened, haunted, blighted; but they were melting together for him, making him, by their combination, only the more sure that, as he probably called it to himself, he liked her. That was presently what remained with her--his really doing it; and with the natural and proper incident of being conciliated by her weakness. Would she really have had him--she could ask herself that--disconcerted or disgusted by it? If he could only be touched enough to do what she preferred, not to raise, not to press any question, he might render her a much better service than by merely enabling her to refuse him. Again, again it was strange, but he figured to her for the moment as the one safe sympathiser. It would have made her worse to talk to others, but she wasn't afraid with him of how he might wince and look pale. She would keep him, that is, her one easy relation--in the sense of easy for himself. Their actual outlook had meanwhile such charm, what surrounded them within and without did so much toward making appreciative stillness as natural as at the opera, that she could consider she hadn't made him hang on her lips when at last, instead of saying if she were well or ill, she repeated: [...] "I go about here. I don't get tired of it. I never should--it suits me so. I adore the place," [...] she went on, [...] "and I don't want in the least to give it up." ...|$|E
