40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 A rapidly {{changing}} climate and human disturbance patterns have accelerated {{the spread of}} invasive plants species in Alaska. Non-native plant invasions can disrupt pollinator services to native plants and {{have the potential to}} impact the pollination and fruit set in <b>berry</b> <b>species</b> important for subsistence harvest. My dissertation aims to address the dual need for greater understanding of the impacts of invasive plants on pollination of <b>berry</b> <b>species</b> in boreal ecosystems and the need for research on education strategies that best prepare Alaskans to respond to the issue. I integrate an ecological field experiment, a citizen science program where data is used to validate phenology models derived from heraium data, and an invasive plants education experiment testing the effects of a metacognitive learning intervention to provide multiple perspectives that inform the management of invasive plants in Alaska. The ecological field experiment found that invasive Melilotus albus acts as a magnet species for pollinators, which increased seed production in Vaccinium vitis-idaea, slightly decreased pollination in Rhododendron groenlandicum, and had no detectable interactions with Vaccinium uliginosum. The impact M. albus had on R. groenlandicum changed with distance from the invasive plant patch, but the impact on V. vitis-idaea did not. Using data from a statewide citizen science program monitoring the phenology of these species, I found that herbarium-based phenology models were valid for assessing relative shifts in phenology of these species across Alaska. Employing the research on M. albus and the <b>berry</b> <b>species</b> as a test case, I found that students who received the metacognitive learning intervention show long-term improvement in metacognitive skills compared to students in the control group, but that the groups did not differ in their ability to apply resilience thinking skills to the environmental problem-solving. I synthesized social-ecological resilience and education research to investigate how citizen science and metacognitive learning could contribute to the capacity of Alaskans to respond to social-ecological change. Together, the ecology and education research presented here provide diverse perspectives on how to best manage and build the human capacity to manage M. albus near subsistence plant species...|$|E
40|$|In {{northwest}} British Columbia, long indigenous occupancy {{and management}} of the landscape has had pervasive ecological effects. In such an environment discriminating "natural" and "anthropogenic" vegetation and plant distributions may be problematic. One approach to revealing the influence of First Nations on vegetation and plant distribution is through analysis of the anomalous distributions of plant species which are known to be ethnobotanically important. My research with Ken Downs, recently graduated MAIS student, focuses upon anomalies in the distribution of two key economic species: Pacific Crabapple; and rice root lily in the Skeena River region. Examination of historic management for <b>berry</b> <b>species</b> through landscape buring is another approach to documenting the influence of First Nations on habitats and productivity of managed species...|$|E

We used as elicitors: temperature, light (blue or red spectra) and changes of medium composition, i. e. increased nitrogen concentration. Anthocyanin production was significantly increased only by elicitation with light, either blue or red spectra, in blackberry and strawberry-tree cultures, and particularly red light in strawberry. In red raspberry cultures anthocyanin accumulation was not affected by any elicitor...|$|E

Consumers prefer small fruit because of the rising interest in their nutraceutical value, and they have a higher willingness to pay because of this important attribute...|$|E
40|$|Berry fruits are recognized, worldwide, as “superfoods” due to {{the high}} content of {{bioactive}} natural products and the health benefits deriving from their consumption. Berry leaves are byproducts of berry cultivation; their traditional therapeutic use against several diseases, such as the common cold, inflammation, diabetes, and ocular dysfunction, has been almost forgotten nowadays. Nevertheless, the scientific interest regarding the leaf composition and beneficial properties grows, documenting that berry leaves may be considered an alternative source of bioactives. The main bioactive compounds in berry leaves are similar as in berry fruits, i. e., phenolic acids and esters, flavonols, anthocyanins, and procyanidins.

Methods and Results. Proanthocyanidins (Pcys) extracted from 11 <b>berry</b> <b>species</b> are monitored for proapoptotic activities on two related human colon cancer cell lines: SW 480 -TRAIL-sensitive and SW 620 -TRAIL-resistant. Apoptosis induction is monitored by cell surface phosphatidylserine (PS) detection. Lowbush blueberry extract triggers the strongest activity. When tested on the human monocytic cell line THP- 1, blueberry Pcys are less effective for PS externalisation and DNA fragmentation is absent, highlighting a specificity of apoptosis induction in gut cells. In Pcys-treated gut cell lines, caspase 8 (apoptosis extrinsic pathway) but not caspase 9 (apoptosis intrinsic pathway) is activated after 3 hours through P 38 phosphorylation (90 [*]min), emphasizing the potency of lowbush blueberry Pcys to eradicate gut TRAIL-resistant cancer cells.

Michurin initiated the mass movement of gardeners and horticulture experimenters in USSR who changed and significantly extended the assortment and areas of fruit and berries cultivation in the country. He not only brought together a representative collection of species and varieties of fruit, berry and flower plants from around the world, but also used them in breeding by hybridization, including interspecific. He created some new artificial interspecific hybrids such as Cerapadus (cherry and bird cherry tree hybrid), and others. Michurin created 132 cultivars. Eleven of them are not only cultivated, but are also included in “The State Register of Protected Plant Breeding of the Russian Federation”...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although the {{medicinal}} {{properties of}} berry fruit are well known, there is relatively little information available concerning the applications of {{other parts of}} berry plants. Thus, {{in this study we}} determined the nutritional value of the leaves of selected <b>berry</b> <b>species</b> and their possible application in health promoting diets. The levels of nutrients, and macro- and microelements in the leaves of four species collected from allotment gardens in the city of Szczecin, Poland (53 ° 26 ′ 17 ″ N, 14 ° 32 ′ 32 ″ E; altitude 7 m a. s. l.) were identified: raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.), chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa L.), and sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.). Sea buckthorn leaves were the richest source of protein, raspberry leaves had the highest levels of lipids, and the leaves of all four species studied were a rich source of crude fibre and dietary fibre fractions. Desirable Ca:P and Na:K ratios indicated their potential as a good source of minerals essential to bone formation and the treatment of hypertension. Sea buckthorn leaves contained high but also safe Fe levels (within recommended WHO limits) and, therefore, may become an alternative rich source of this element...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} methyl jasmonate in {{combination}} with ethanol on the formation of aroma constituents in berryfruit belonging to the Rosaceae was investigated. Postharvest treatments of raspberries, strawberries and blackberries were carried out. After evaluating the aromatic fractions of the berries, esters and terpenes were the most abundant compounds. There were different effects of the treatment according to the <b>berry</b> <b>species.</b> In contrast to raspberries, which exhibited a significant decline (p< 0. 05) in {{the total amount of}} volatiles after treatment, a significant (p< 0. 05) enhancement of total volatile compounds was observed in strawberries, while no significant effect was found in blackberries. Esters and terpene compounds responded similarly in strawberries and blackberries suggesting similarity in the biochemistry of their aroma synthesis. In contrast, raspberry volatile compounds showed a different pattern, reflecting different biosynthetic pathways for aroma formation in raspberry. The natural volatile compounds, methyl jasmonate and ethanol, seemed to have either promoting effects on the formation of the (-) -enantiomers of chiral terpenes and ionones or inhibitory effects on the synthesis of the corresponding (+) -enantiomers. © 2011 Elsevier B.
