25|$|Once {{detection}} becomes public, decision-makers would exert influence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> {{evaluate the}} importance and handle the publicity of the discovery. It is possible that such actors would emphasize or minimize its importance to extract political advantage. The contact could be framed as a positive development that will benefit the nation and humankind. Likewise, {{it could be used}} to warn of potential dangers and provoke public anxieties. Each course of action would have profound effects on how the press and the general public react. Michaud posits that the more decipherable the information received from contact with ETI, the higher a chance there is for political reaction against alien cultural influences. Extremist groups, both religious and secular, could weigh in, attacking information from ETI as evil or immoral. It is possible that this would spark attempts to terminate communication by interfering with the signal or targeting the detecting technology with attacks. Albert Harrison has written that it would be “foolish and negligent” to fail to anticipate such reactions in the formulation of policies and plans.|$|E

2500|$|Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin {{met at a}} Roxy Music {{concert in}} September 1975, {{at a time when}} glam rock had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify. From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an {{unsigned}} band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the [...] "Bromley Contingent", as most of them came from the Bromley region of South London, a label Severin came to despise. [...] "There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> felt and they looked". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on [...] "The Lord's Prayer".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common manners of {{classifying}} vine training systems now is based on which parts of the vines are permanent fixtures which determines which parts of the vine are removed each year as part of the winter pruning. With a cane-trained system, there are no permanent cordons or branches that are kept year after year. The vine is pruned down to the spur in winter, leaving only one strong cane which is then trained into becoming the main branch for next year's crop. Examples of cane trained systems include the Guyot and Pendelbogen. With spur-trained systems, the main branch or cordon is kept each year with only individual canes being pruned during the winter. While vines that are cane trained will often have a thin, smooth main branch, spur trained vines will often have thick, dark and gnarled cordon branches. Many old vine vineyards will often utilize spur training system. Some examples of spur-training systems include the goblet or bush vine systems, and Cordon de Royat. Some systems, like the Scott Henry and VSP Trellis, can be adapted to both spur and cane training. Vine systems that are classified as either cane or spur trained may be alternately described <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are pruned in the winter so systems that are described as [...] "cane-trained" [...] will be spur pruned while systems that are [...] "spur-trained" [...] will be cane-pruned.|$|E
