40|$|The {{standard}} {{scenario for}} GPS surveying {{is to use}} two carrier phase-tracking GPS receivers, one located at a &quot;reference &quot; station with known coordinates and the second one at a station whose coordinates are to be determined. (It is also possible to determine a trajectory when the second receiver is in motion.) However, the cost of two GPS receivers, and associated software, is high and has precluded their use by many surveyors. One way of reducing the cost of GPS surveys is to propose that the reference station receiver be operated as a service by some government agency or private industry organisation. In this way the surveyor need only purchase a single GPS receiver, and {{does not need to}} deploy a second field party to operate the <b>base</b> <b>receiver.</b> Even further savings could be won if the data processing could be carried out by a third party, for example by submitting the recorded data to a WWW site that has access to the <b>base</b> <b>receiver</b> data.

40|$|Currently, high {{precision}} kinematic GPS positioning with centimetre level accuracy {{can only be}} carried out using differential GPS (DGPS) positioning techniques which require the deployment of <b>base</b> <b>receiver</b> stations. The requirement to deploy <b>base</b> <b>receiver</b> stations, however, spatially limits the operating range of the rover receiver to about 20 km from the base stations. As a result, it not only increases the operational costs of equipment and human resources but also significantly increases the logistical complexity for many applications such as land geodetic surveying and airborne geo-referencing and mapping. With the increased availability of precise GPS satellite orbit and clock data in real-time from the International GPS Service (IGS) and many other organizations, {{high precision}} kinematic positioning at centimetre to decimetre level is now possible using a single GPS receiver. Presented in this paper are the methods and algorithms {{that have been developed}} at the University of Calgary for high precision kinematic positioning using a single dual-frequency GPS receiver. Different from the conventional DGPS approach, the new system does not need a base station since the position determination is based on the processing of un-differenced GPS code and carrier phase observations. This eliminates the range limitation related to the conventional methods, resulting in instant advantages in field operations. A software system developed at the University of Calgary will also be described along with numerical results to demonstrate the obtainable positioning accuracy and its potential for various applications. 1...|$|E

Nowadays the us age of an airborne GPS receiver as the main sensor for these parameters has become the preferred solution for the Flight Tests Instrumentation (FTI) systems. The main problem arises when it is required a high accuracy for these measurements (e. g. air data calibration) where the solution is achieved through differential GPS techniques. The integration of this solution requires the acquisition and the correlation of the pseudorange and phase measurements for all GPS satellites in view observed by both base and rover GPS receivers. To avoid the usage of an additional uplink for the GPS differential corrections (i. e. from the <b>base</b> <b>receiver</b> to the rover), it was developed a novel solution where the GPS observables acquired by the rover receiver are merged into the FTI PCM data stream and processed in the Telemetry ground station by a Real Time GPS Navigation (GNAV) tool together with the GPS observables acquired by the <b>base</b> <b>receiver.</b> The GNAV development is divided into several phases where the accuracy for the trajectory parameters and the complexity of the solution increases.

One statistic, the standard deviation of the code minus carrier, can be used to create a picture of the pseudorange distortion â usually multipath â from a single receiver.
