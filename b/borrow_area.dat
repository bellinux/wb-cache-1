ERO Resources Corporation (ERO) is {{conducting}} revegetation {{tests on the}} Beartooth Plateau to assist Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in identifying techniques that maximize opportunities for successful revegetation along high altitude portions of U. S. Highway 212, the Beartooth Highway. A portion of the Beartooth Highway that travels through alpine and subalpine areas is proposed for reconstruction by FHWA. ERO and FHWA have conducted revegetation experiments since 1999 to identify the most successful revegetation techniques for revegetating alpine areas. This paper presents {{the findings of the}} fourth year of annual monitoring of one of the revegetation experiments. In September 1999, ERO placed revegetation tests plots in an existing gravel <b>borrow</b> <b>area</b> along the Beartooth Highway. The variables tested were soil salvaging, seeding rates, soil amendments, and reapplication of Kiwi Power TM or inorganic fertilizer. Native seed was collected on Beartooth Plateau and used for direct seeding of the revegetation test plots. Results from this study will assist mining, oil and gas, and utility companies, highway departments, and other land management agencies in revegetating high altitude disturbances to meet requirements of various state, local, and federal permits. The 2003 monitoring indicated that of all the variables tested, topsoil placement appeared to have the most beneficial effect on vegetation cover. Fertilizer reapplication, seeding rate, and organic material application did not have statistically significant effects on vegetation cover...|$|E

During the project, approximately 1. 1 million cubic yards of beach compatible material was taken from two offshore borrow areas and placed on 5. 3 miles of beach. Treatment stations were at offshore (adjacent to the <b>borrow</b> <b>area)</b> and nearshore (adjacent to fill area) locations. Control stations were placed at least 3 km north, offshore of John U.

Two coral species abundant in this area, Solenastrea bournoni and Dichocoenia stokesii, were monitored monthly on each reef for signs of bleaching and polyp expansion, indicators of stress and surface clearing ability respectively. After dredging was completed, the corals were collected for growth analysis (linear extension) by the Alizarin stain method. At treatment stations, associated with dredging, {{a significant decrease in}} extension growth rate in S. bournoni but not D. stokesii occurred. A decrease in fossa length of D. stokesii suggested that dredging effects caused a change in columella shape. Bleaching occurred in many of the colonies but may have been caused by an unknown factor. Polyp expansion, a means of sediment rejection, did not correlate with the proximity to dredging. The corals may be relying on other means of sediment removal.

The result of those measurement is, that the measured relative density for the Maasvlakte II project is higher than the values that can be found in literature for the different kind of work methods. Thus the objective of this MSc-thesis is to understand the influencing and determining processes for the relative density of dumped or sprayed sand underwater. This MSc-thesis can be divided in four parts. The first part describes the characteristics of sand and the relation between the density and the relative density. Laboratory testing is executed to determine the relevant parameters of the sand, such as the minimum and maximum density and the particle size distribution. The second part describes the used work methods, such as dumping, rainbowing, back filling through the suction pipe and spraying with a spray pontoon, that are used by the construction of the Maasvlakte II project. The third part describes the analysis of the CPT data. The CPT data is linked to the work methods and the relative density based on the correlations of Baldi and Lunne and Christoffersen. Also, a statistical analysis is made. The statistical analysis is based upon different kinds of statistical tests, such as Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} conflicts of interest to resolve, as regards siltation mitigation, is perhaps beach nourishment. When sediments are placed on or near beaches in order to replenish an eroding beach, any fines in the material will continue to be washed out {{for as long as the}} sand is being reworked. Given that all replenished beaches are eroding (or else they would not need replenishment), they will contribute to nearshore siltation almost for as long as it takes to erode away what was added, albeit with somewhat decreasing intensity over time. Since this leakage is detrimental to coral reefs, the practice leads to a direct conflict between the public interest of saving beaches, and preserving any nearshore coral reefs. To minimize the conflict, beach replenishment should only be done with sand not containing any silt or clay fractions. In practice the sand is often taken from offshore <b>borrowing</b> <b>areas,</b> and since the proportion of fines in sediments typically increases in the offshore direction, the deposited sand will inevitably contain a significant percentage of siltation-contributing fines.|$|R

Golder Associates Inc. was {{retained}} by the City of Dalton to provide engineering {{services for the}} design and construction of a 1, 100 million gallon off-stream storage water reservoir. The design of the reservoir incorporates a blend of environmental, wetlands, and hydraulic issues. The proposed reservoir is located adjacent to the Conasauga River, approximately 10 miles upstream of the City of Dalton's water treatment facilities. The reservoir is the second {{of a series of}} reservoirs to be constructed for Dalton Utilities to supplement the city's public and industrial water supply. An additional off-stream reservoir, the Conasauga Reservoir, is located approximately 6 miles downstream of the proposed reservoir. The Conasauga Reservoir was constructed in 1990 and has a maximum storage capacity of 500 million gallons. During seasonal high flows of the Conasauga River, water will be pumped into the reservoir. During seasonal low flows, or at other times as needed, water from the reservoir will be released back into the river to augment flow to the water treatment plant. Environmental design concerns include (1) impacts on aquatic life in the river, including two federally endangered fish species, the amber darter (Percina antesella) and the Conasauga log perch (Percina jenkinsi); and (2) creation of wetlands habitat within the proposed <b>borrow</b> <b>area</b> between the reservoir and the river.

40|$|Egmont Key, {{located at}} the mouth of Tampa Bay, is part of a dynamic system with many interrelated natural and {{anthropogenic}} factors influencing its morphodynamics. This study started in August 2012. During the 3 -year period until August 2015, 28 beach profile transects were established and surveyed 10 times. Seventeen historical aerial images from 1942 to 2013 were geo-rectified and analyzed. Three hundred and fourteen sediment samples were procured from the navigation channel dredge area and the beach nourishment area and analyzed for grain size. A numerical wave model was established to simulate the nearshore wave field. The overall goals of this study are to understand the complex morphodynamics of Egmont Key and to evaluate the shore-protection efforts. The overall area of the Egmont Key has reduced 52 % from 2. 1 km 2 in 1942 to 1. o km 2 in 2002. The area loss was mostly caused by beach erosion along the Gulf-facing beach. The island-area reduction from 1942 to 2002 was largely linear. Two periods of accelerated area loss from 1978 - 1984 and 1999 - 2002 can be related to dredging of the Egmont Channel and the disposal of dredged materials along the channel. Concerning the relatively high mud content in the <b>borrow</b> <b>area</b> for the 2014 nourishment, a large amount of the fine sediment was lost at a temporal scale of hours to days during the dredging and beach nourishment construction processes. Some of the mud was deposited outside the surf zone at water depths of 2 m or greater. This mud became eroded naturally by energetic conditions at a temporal scale of months. Beach erosion and accretion along the Gulf-facing beach can be related qualitatively to tidal flow patterns. Numerical wave modeling shows that the transverse bars offshore Egmont Key have a moderate influence on the wave field, leading to slightly different wave heights along the shoreline. However, there is no clear relationship between the nearshore wave conditions and the erosion/accretion patterns. The severe shoreline erosion has exposed various fort structures at the shoreline and in the nearshore zone. These structures function as detached breakwaters or groins and have localized influence on the beach state...|$|E
40|$|The Calaveras Dam, in Sunol California {{was deemed}} to be {{susceptible}} to failure during a moderate earthquake in the region when it was examined in 2001. As {{a result of the}} 2001 study, a replacement dam was designed to withstand a magnitude 7. 25 maximum credible earthquake (MCE). The accepted design consisted of an earth and fill dam using materials sourced from borrow areas within the site boundaries. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate design alternatives to the accepted design for the Calaveras Dam Replacement Project (CDRP). This was accomplished by conducting in depth research into earth dams and the materials that they are comprised of. Next, the materials available onsite were investigated using historic borehole logs and site investigation reports. Using the information found through research, an asphalt core and concrete face dam were modelled using the computer software package Slide 6. 0 to determine their stability. This dissertation found that while the two design alternatives showed acceptable slope stability they would not be as effective or safe as the design earth and fill dam. The circumstances in which these alternatives may be chosen may be if the core material available on site was not suitable for use under the design specifications, however, {{it was found that the}} core material used from <b>borrow</b> <b>area</b> E in the existing design, met all of the design specifications. Therefore, In this case, importation of an impermeable core would not be necessary. Next, if the core material was found to be susceptible to cracking under seismic loading an alternative core would be necessary. However, due to constraints on the length of this dissertation it was decided that seismic considerations on slope stability would be omitted as seismic considerations could form the basis for a dissertation in itself. Next, the asphalt core dam and concrete core dams would require the importation of significant amounts of fill material. This is costly and has significant implications on the safety of those using Calaveras Road. Therefore, it was concluded that the existing earth and rockfill dam design was the safest most effective method of construction of the three considerations for the Calaveras Dam Replacement Project...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it <b>borrowed</b> extensive <b>areas</b> of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration. The game differed in its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding. Metroid {{was also one of}} the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine land ownership, land {{alienation}} and a condition of the tenant in a newly risen village, where rice production was stable, in Maubin district, Ayeyarwaddy delta, from 1892 in which reclamination of land was just started, to 1947 of independence. The existent studies say that non-agriculturalists became to own about 50 % of land in Ayeyarwaddy delta in 1930 s. However, when, how extent and why this phenomenon proceeded are not clear. This paper tries to throw some light on these problems from one case study. The following resulted from this study: The trend of enlargement of land ownership and un-equalization had begun just after reclamation of the delta. About 30 % of landowner was non-agriculturist and 80 % of land was rented out to tenants in early 20 th century. The landowners who could sustain their land were people with the rich fund. The “farmer” in rural area was a tenant under this situation. Tenants were supposed to be not so poor as to say by the existent studies arid they also enlarged <b>borrowing</b> <b>area.</b> After the world depression, the trend of enlargement of land owner-ship and un-equalization was stopped...|$|R
