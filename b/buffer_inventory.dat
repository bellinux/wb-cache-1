50|$|A third issue {{comes from}} the view that {{inventory}} also serves the function of decoupling two separate operations.

With improved coordination this <b>buffer</b> <b>inventory</b> could be eliminated. This leads to the whole philosophy of Just In Time, which argues {{that the costs of}} carrying inventory have typically been underestimated, both the direct, obvious costs of storage space and insurance, but also the harder-to-measure costs of increased variables and complexity, and thus decreased flexibility, for the business enterprise.|$|E
50|$|However, with JIS {{the buffer}} {{quantities}} are displaced upward in material {{flow to the}} components suppliers. It is a misinterpretation of JIS to assume that all buffers will be eliminated. Hence just the cost for <b>buffer</b> <b>inventory</b> becomes re-allocated to the producers of the supplies. Sequencing eliminates buffers in the final assembly line by consolidating all similar components into distributed and sequenced buffers, which partly reside on the paths of transportation to final assembly. This strategy thus reduces the line-side inventory buffer. However, the effect is worse when the sequence does not get correctly scheduled upwards or when the transportation line gets congested.|$|E

However, there is a trade-off between the long-term benefits of a supply chain and the disruption mitigation costs.

Previous studies have discussed reducing risk in terms of mitigation and responsiveness to disruption events; however, many companies maintain low inventories and a single source supplier represented by just-in-time or lean manufacturing. Through interviews, we found that in addition to providing long-term benefits, maintaining low inventory can increase the efficiency of recovery activities.

We develop a theoretical model that focuses on potential internal spillover costs of the buyer receiving low-quality inputs and external spillover costs should low-quality inputs go undetected. Key to our analysis is the condition of whether a buyer can commit to the intensity of supply inspection. If a buyer cannot commit, supply inspections and plant inspections are substitutes, as widely believed. The two types of inspections, however, may become complements when a buyer is able to commit to the intensity of supply inspection. Complementarity is especially likely when (a) external spillovers are smaller than expected internal spillovers, which depends {{on the level of}} <b>buffer</b> <b>inventory,</b> (b) when knowledge sharing between buyer and supplier becomes more effective as the supplier allocates more resources to learning for quality improvement, or (c) when hiding aspects of the production processes is easier for suppliers.

Empirical results provide broad support for theory, which, we argue, might help to explain variation in inspection practices across industries. Our theory and empirical analysis contribute to the literatures on strategic management, organizational economics, and procurement management by highlighting the organizational and strategic use of inspection practices. supply chain, inspection, complementarity, spillovers, biotechnology, quality, moral hazard...|$|E

Telecom equipment manufacturers need to be competitive; minimizing costs and ensuring availability of the products {{at the right moment}} and in the right place. Client companies set explicit requirements on the service level and often charge penalties for not having the guaranteed level of service met. The problem of ensuring service levels through inventory management is more difficult when telecom equipment manufacturers have different buffers, and one depends on the other to try to manage the inventory locally and without optimizing it globally. Through collaborative models which imply making decisions in a centralized way using a holistic concept of the supply chain, companies can optimize service levels. Nowadays, buffer management plays an important role for supply chain companies that are involved in an extremely competitive global environment and that are customer-oriented like Telecom equipment manufacturers. The objective of this thesis is to develop a model to determine the optimal deployment of <b>buffer</b> <b>inventory</b> across the supply chain (two-echelon) in order to maximize inventory availability and service levels at the minimum cost.

This is a rapidly growing industry sector supporting one of Queensland’s major export industries. The specific objective of this research is to examine how companies in the supply chain employ techniques to identify, assess, and manage supply risks. The research methodology entailed the use of in-depth interviews of companies in Rockhampton, Mackay and Yeppoon in Central Queensland. This method has been selected because of limited empirical data relating to supply chain issues in this field. Quantitative questions have been incorporated into an interview questionnaire to gain more information in the limited time available. A total of 21 interviews were conducted, and methods of qualitative description and descriptive statistics have been used to analyse the subsequent data. The results show that Supply Unavailable, Supply Price Increase, and Unpredictable Lead Times are three main sources of supply risks perceived by respondents. For risk identification and assessment, specific techniques have been adopted widely, especially Communication with Suppliers. For risk mitigation, Alternative Suppliers when Supply Interrupted is perceived as the most important technique to reduce the impact of risk occurrence, while Close Working Relationship with Suppliers and Localised Sourcing are broadly used as the techniques to reduce the likelihood of risk occurrence. However, traditional buffer-oriented techniques, such as Multiple Sourcing, and Increased Stockpiling and <b>Buffer</b> <b>Inventory,</b> are not as popular in this industry as would be expected from published literature.

The research considers both the well-known straight line balancing problem and U-line balancing problem where the line is paced, with no <b>buffer</b> <b>inventories</b> between stations. The objective is to minimize a two component cost function where the cost terms come from cost of manning the line and cost of finishing the incomplete units off the line. Cost is measured by an existing exact method for straight line balancing and a heuristic cost measurement method is developed for U-line balancing. The key idea {{in the core of}} this research is a task's marginal desirability for assignment at a given station. This idea is embedded in a beam search heuristic for solving both the straight line and U-line balancing problem. Extensive computational experiments and simulation experiments are made with well-known problems in the literature under the assumption of normally distributed task processing times. The quality of the solutions found by beam search for the straight-line balancing problem is compared to an existing method in literature.

40|$|Abstract: Good {{inventory}} management {{can lead to}} high organisational performance by minimising inventory holding costs and improving customer service across the supply chain. The management of inventory remains a major challenge for many organisations as continuous changes in the supply chain occur. According to the CSIR (2014), investment in inventories across South African supply chains is significant {{and it is difficult}} for South African companies to compete with mature economies on a cost level due to the relative high costs of logistics transportation in the country. Inventory control is often seen as one of the lowest areas of competitive advantage, however it can be the largest single investment in assets for most organisations. From a theoretical point of view, the Theory of Constraints (TOC) seems to offer a solution to {{inventory management}} challenges. The TOC is a scientific methodology that is designed to assist organisations in identifying and solving critical process based problems following a continuous improvement approach. The TOC also unifies and simplifies the inventory quantity of an organisation into a single value called the buffer quantity. One of the clearly stated advantages of the application of TOC according to literature, is a reduction of inventory levels. This study attempts to support existing literature on the impact of the TOC on buffer levels by means of a case study of an organisation that has undergone a TOC application in South Africa. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} provide a case study implementation of the TOC to corroborate the theory that a successful implementation of the TOC can reduce inventory levels in a South African organisation without adverse effects on customer service levels. A case study of an envelope manufacturer which had implemented TOC principles was conducted through a literature review followed by empirical research to determine the impact of the TOC implementation on the organisation’s <b>buffer</b> <b>inventory</b> levels. The selected organisation provided an opportunity to investigate the scenarios before, during and after a TOC implementation. In-depth, semi structured interviews were conducted with [...] . M. Com.

These {{systems have been}} widely implemented {{in recent years and}} constitute a significant aspect of lean manufacturing. Extensive research has appeared on the optimal sizing of <b>buffer</b> <b>inventory</b> levels in such systems. However the issue of control points, i. e. where in the multistage sequence to locate the output buffers, has not been addressed for pull systems. Allowable container/batch sizes, optimal inventory levels, and ability of systems to automatically adjust to stochastic demand depend on the location of these control points. We begin by examining a serial production system producing a single part type. Two models are examined in this regard. In the first, container size is independent of the control section, while in the second, container sizes are section dependent. Additionally, a nesting policy is introduced which introduces the additional constraint that the container size in a section is related to the container size in any other section by a power of two. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for ensuring that a single, end-of-line accumulation point is optimal. When this is not the case, an algorithm is provided to determine the optimal control points. Effects of factors such as value added structure, fixed location cost, setup and material handling cost, kanban collection time, and material transportation time on the control structure are investigated. Results are extended to determine the optimal container size when lead time at a stage is a concave function of container size. The study is then extended to a multi-product case. Queuing aspects are introduced to account for the interaction between the different part types. The queuing model used is a modification of the Decomposition/Recomposition model described in Shantikumar and Buzacott (1981). The models in the chapter do not assume a serial structure any longer. Additionally, general interarrival and service time distributions are considered. The effect of number of products, demand arrival distribution, value added structure, and number of stages on the control structure and system cost is investigated.

30|$|Uncertainty plays a {{important}} role in most inventory management situations. The retailer wants enough supply to satisfy customer demands, but too much ordering increases holding costs {{and the risk of}} losses through obsolescence or spoilage. Also, too small order increases the risk of lost sales and unsatisfied customers. Thus the operations manager has to sets a master production schedule where he has to forecasts the imprecise nature of demands and optimize the quantity and manufacturing time to obtain maximum profit. Many work has been done by the researchers using deterministic condition. Pal et al. [33] worked with price and stock depended demand for deteriorating items. (Sarkar and Sarkar [43], Prasad and Mukherjee [36], etc.) worked on stock-dependent demand for deteriorating items and with partial backlogging. Thus in classical EOQ model the researchers works with deterministic approach and analyzed the inventory system which is not satisfactory when uncertainty is present. Nowadays researchers are working with uncertainty in demand, in production process and production time, in lead time, etc. Browne and Paul [6] concerned with the (r, q) inventory model, where demand accumulates continuously, but the demand rate at each instant is determined by an underlying stochastic process. Gumus and Guneri [14] worked on multi inventory stochastic and fuzzy supply chain. Manna et al. [31] worked with three layer supply chain model in fuzzy environment. Kumar et al. [24] worked on economic production lot size model with stochastic demand and shortage partial backlogging rate under imperfect quality items. Sana [41] developed an model for stochastic demand for limited capacity of own warehouse. Pal et al.

Alshamrani [2] considers a stochastic optimal control of an inventory model with a deterministic rate of deteriorating items. Abdelsalam and Elassal [1] extended the work of Ben-Daya et al.

Lin and Wu [29] developed a model with combined pricing and supply chain operations under price-dependent Stochastic demand. He et al.
