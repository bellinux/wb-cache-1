5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{within a few}} years to decades of the {{destruction}} of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders. Both accounts were compromised at best, and are often taken to be worthless, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only accounts from people who may have been familiar with the script first-hand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} and final chapter, Yajnavalkya lists exemplars of Paramahamsas, the highest renouncers: the sages Samvartaka, Aruni, Svetaketu, Durvasa, Ribhu, Nidagha, Jadabharata, Dattatreya and Raivataka. The Paramahamsas do not carry {{articles}} or show signs that suggest they have renounced, their conduct is concealed, they may only seem insane. They do not carry staves, nor bowl, nor hair tuft, nor sacred thread, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ones who seek after the Atman (self, soul).|$|E
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> largest members of the colony. The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still {{as long as the}} head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The hairs on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E

50|$|In medieval {{societies}} {{liberal and}} mechanical arts were considered as totally {{different from each}} other. Metallurgists, as all craftsmen and artisans, lacked the methodical intellectual background <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> pioneers of causal thinking, based on empirical observation and experimentation (Zilsel 2000).|$|R
25|$|Fire Fighter (White helmet) is {{the lowest}} rank of {{operational}} fire personnel, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most important, because they make up the numbers. These fire-fighters can be trained {{just as much as}} a more highly ranked person but they do not usually take a leadership role at an incident.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, an {{ontology}} is a {{model for}} describing the world that consists {{of a set of}} types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian {{cultural}} caravan {{reaches out}} to very different artists to create this multi-format exhibition. It brings together painters, photographers, as well as actors, film-makers, writers, poets, and musicians. The artists are very versatile: {{not only do they}} create, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> technical staff of the exhibition and set up the exhibition themselves. They also manage the contact with the media and are present during the whole day of the exhibition to explain and answer the public’s questions.|$|E
25|$|This view of {{software}} quality on a linear continuum {{has to be}} supplemented by the identification of discrete Critical Programming Errors. These vulnerabilities may not fail a test case, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> result of bad practices that under specific circumstances can lead to catastrophic outages, performance degradations, security breaches, corrupted data, and myriad other problems (Nygard, 2007) that make a given system de facto unsuitable for use regardless of its rating based on aggregated measurements. A well-known example of vulnerability is the Common Weakness Enumeration, a repository of vulnerabilities in the source code that make applications exposed to security breaches.|$|E
25|$|At least some, if not all, of the Indonesian ships have {{replaced}} their Seacat launchers with two twin Simbad launchers. Recently, the two quadruple Harpoon launchers were also replaced by Yakhont missile (SS-N-26) launchers purchased from Russia, because the early version Harpoon missiles previously installed were nearing their obsolescence period. There {{are also some}} conflicting reports that the Harpoon missiles were replaced with Chinese-sourced C-802 rather than Russian Yakhont. There are some pictures circulating on the internet showing several vessels of the class carrying box launchers that look much {{too small to be}} Yakhont's launchers, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> right size for C-802.|$|E

25|$|Gibraltar is {{the only}} {{overseas}} territory {{that is part of}} the European Union (EU), although it is not part of the European Customs Union, the European Tax Policy, the European Statistics Zone or the Common Agriculture Policy. Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union in its own right. The Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus are not part of the European Union, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only British overseas territory to use the euro as official currency. None of the other Overseas Territories are members of the EU, the main body of EU law does not apply and, although certain slices of EU law are applied to those territories as part of the EU's Association of Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT Association), they are not commonly enforceable in local courts. The OCT Association also provides overseas territories with structural funding for regeneration projects.|$|E
500|$|In June 1999, United {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the FA {{to withdraw from the}} FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, staged in Brazil. It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil. They could tell us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I cannot {{consider}} the Bill of Rights {{to be an}} outworn 18th century 'strait jacket.' ... Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some. And {{it is true that}} they were designed to meet ancient evils. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few {{at the expense of the}} many. In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and respected... I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E

50|$|First National Bank of Boston was not {{interested}} in the real estate, so their offer of $120 million for the mortgage banking business was accepted. Gate Petroleum bid $60 million for the real estate portfolio, which <b>was</b> less than <b>the</b> value of <b>the</b> assets, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only entity that submitted an offer on just the real estate, so <b>the</b> properties <b>were</b> sold to Gate.|$|R

500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. Film4 criticized {{both the}} film's long running time and its {{treatment}} of female characters, remarking [...] " [...] cameo strikingly in buttock form. Others actually have first names". But Film4 praised Johnson's role as DSS agent Luke Hobbs, saying he [...] "provides a more credible anti-antagonist to our anti-heroes than the straight up villains can manage". [...] The Boston Herald gave a more mixed reaction: it derided the lack of realism as removing any sense of threat to the protagonists, but conceded that [...] "these films may be robustly anti-intellectual and deplorably commercialized, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> envy {{of the rest of}} the world." [...] Despite giving the film a positive review and praising the action, The Hollywood Reporter was critical of its stars, saying [...] "it's clear the budget wasn't used on acting lessons for the cast." [...] The New York Posts Kyle Smith gave the film a negative review, criticizing the shortage of car-related action before the finale and calling it less a [...] "vroomer" [...] and more a [...] "knucklehead Ocean's Eleven". [...] Smith went on to call the film's villain Reyes (Almeida) [...] "unforgivably dull" [...] and considered the long running time a result of taking [...] "that long to read every item in the cliché dictionary." [...] Time Out New York stated that [...] "The Fast and the Furious movies haven't exactly gotten better as they've gone along" [...] but gave the director a backhanded compliment, saying [...] "Justin Lin, taking his third turn behind the franchise's wheel, is at least a competent hack." [...] Ebert was more complimentary, saying [...] "Justin Lin is emerging as a first-rate director in this second-rate genre" [...] and Rolling Stone managed [...] "Justin Lin, who misdirected the last two sequels, finds his pace this time, staging dynamite action." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{simple and}} {{effective}} instrument that Mance invented {{was to be}} an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of heliographs was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> most powerful type of visual signalling device known.

5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. <b>The</b> main armament <b>was</b> four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft.
