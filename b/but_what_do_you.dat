500|$|Marcus Söderlund {{directed}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Silvia". It premiered exclusively on NME website in December 2009. A writer for Complex commented, [...] "The vid {{is kind of}} dramatic and hard to make sense of, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> expect from a band like this?" [...] The video plays out in a post-apocalyptic world. It begins with the band's three members waking up from sleeping {{in the middle of}} a street, appearing to be homeless. The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed. Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band. They then set fire to a large wooden version of a jackalope and the video ends as it bursts into flames.|$|E
500|$|... "Toxic" [...] was {{performed}} by Spears at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. She also performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, 2003, at Staples Center. It was the opening number of her set, and Spears appeared wearing a black top and a white fur cape. While the choreography was deemed as [...] "erotic", Corey Moss of MTV commented {{that some of the}} effect was lost due to Spears's lip synching and a stagehand fixing a prop during the song. On January 24, 2004, Spears opened the 2004 NRJ Music Awards with a performance of [...] "Toxic". During the ceremony, she also presented the NRJ Award of Honor for the Career to Madonna. Spears performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the opening number of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Previous {{to the beginning of the}} tour, she deemed it as the song she was most excited to perform, along with [...] "Everytime". After an introduction in which she briefly appeared on a large video screen, Spears took the stage standing on top of a hotel bus, wearing a tight black catsuit. She was surrounded by dancers dressed as employees and columns of LED lighting, suggesting the façade of a glitzy hotel on the Vegas Strip. MTV UK commented, [...] "OK, so she doesn't so much sing than mime along with Toxic, [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> expect when she's simultaneously performing a vigorous dance routine, ascending moving staircases and descending fireman poles?".|$|E

6000|$|Maggie {{had listened}} with an {{interest}} that wore all the expression of candour. [...] "Oh, you left it for me. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> take?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BENTLEY. [running forward between Lina and Gunner] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean by <b>what</b> {{you said}} about Miss Tarleton and Mr Percival, you beastly rotter, you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{know the}} feeling well. There {{is so much}} {{that ought to be}} done and it seems impossible. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> want to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Beatrice {{interrupted}} him by an impatient, despairing look, and clasped her hands: [...] "I know--I know; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tom sighed deeply, {{and drew}} comfort from his cigar. In {{a few minutes}} he resumed,--"Well, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean by enjoying life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't mention it,' said Mrs. Alicumpaine. 'I {{shall be}} too glad. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think I have come for, ma'am? Guess, ma'am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you," [...] she declared, [...] "you're either asleep or stupid. Did {{you really}} see {{nothing in the}} music? <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Keller, rather sharply. [...] "Then {{it looks}} as if he meant to hold on! He reckoned, not long since, that he'd have to quit. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet {{at moments}} no one blurts things out with such crudity. She {{is like a}} {{revolving}} lighthouse; pitch darkness alternating with a dazzling brilliancy! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell her?" [...] the Doctor asked.|$|R
60|$|Well, Tom, says I, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> do {{among them}} then? come {{away into the}} steerage, and show {{yourself}} an honest man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean to do? for, after all, though parental love is an imposition, parental {{authority}} is a fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! I {{know you}} always are for Lady Merrifield! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say, then, to her prying into all that poor child's correspondence?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A miserable end," [...] said Maitland, {{when he had}} perused the paragraph. [...] "And now I {{had better}} go on with my story? <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean by saying you didn't 'blame' the coroner's jury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not, Jack. The {{man that}} wrongs the craft he sails in {{can never be}} a true-hearted sailor. Stick by your ship in all weathers is my rule, and a good rule it is to go by. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell the stranger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, what a chance! Had I <b>but</b> been there! <b>What</b> an {{opportunity}} for kidnapping a British king, and carrying him off in a fast sailing smack to Boston, a hostage for American freedom. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you?</b> Didn't <b>you</b> try to <b>do</b> something to him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Object. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean {{by those}} expressions? Do {{not do that}} you may believe, but believe so effectually that you may do.|$|E

6000|$|... "Spoken about you!--Fanny? Of {{course she}} has, in an {{ordinary}} way. It {{would be impossible}} that she should not. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Grant," [...] he said blankly, [...] "the {{thing is}} incredible. <b>You</b> were right; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean? All through this dinner-party, where dukes and duchesses and editors of Quarterlies had come {{especially}} to hear him, that extraordinary Wimpole kept perfectly silent. He didn't say a funny thing. He didn't {{say anything at}} all. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> it mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Butler {{looked at}} the huge stacks of wheat, which filled the yard, over which the {{chickens}} were fluttering and crawling, catching grasshoppers, and out of which the crickets were singing innumerably. He smiled in a peculiar way as he said, [...] "Oh, I won't be hard on yeh. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> expect to pay f'r the place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely so, technically; {{but when}} a man unburthens himself on his death-bed, and then, so far from consenting, shows terror and dismay {{at the notion of}} his words being taken down as evidence, it seems to me hardly right or honourable to make use of them--though it would right a great wrong. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get from him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "Yes. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think? If {{you think}} differently, {{and can make}} me see it differently, oughtn't you to do so?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Cope had {{not much}} hope from the parish, so he said, 'Mr. Shepherd {{ought to do}} {{something}} for him after he has worked for him so long. He has been looking wretchedly ill for some time past; and I dare say half this illness is brought on by such lodging and living as he got there. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say about some eggs?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man, Man," [...] it exclaimed, [...] "you {{say that}} I {{finished}} <b>you.</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to me? <b>You</b> shot me.

6000|$|... "Now {{you think}} it's bad luck; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I {{found on the}} top of the ridge day before yesterday?

6000|$|... "To Lady Jane, I suspect, {{rather than}} to me; for he told me broadly enough that all the {{flattering}} attentions which he had received in Manchester-where, you know, all such prophets are received with open arms, their only credentials being that, whatsoever they believe, they shall not believe the Bible-had not given him the pleasure which he had received from that one introduction to what he called 'the inner hearth-life of the English landed aristocracy.' <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think of him?" ...|$|R
