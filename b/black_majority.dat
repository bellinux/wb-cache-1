5|$|At independence, the {{policies}} of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the <b>black</b> <b>majority.</b> The first five years after independence saw rapid gains {{in areas such as}} immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate. Zimbabwe was thus considered internationally to have an achieved a good record of health development.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} led to {{the white}} community also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a coup d'état if a <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> government took power. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as Corps de Voluntaires Européens ("European Volunteer Corps") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} awareness among the <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> {{on the island}} spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad {{during a time when}} American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians of this period included Ernie Small, a trumpeter and pianist, and bandleader St. Clare Jackman.|$|E
50|$|Apportionment {{under the}} {{single-member}} districts meant that some districts had <b>black</b> <b>majorities.</b> In 1952, after {{passage of the}} new charter, African-American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council. The first to gain office since 1911, after disenfranchisement had been achieved by the state government.|$|R

50|$|From the 1930s, {{after many}} African Americans {{had left the}} state seeking work in other areas in the Great Migration, Louisiana has been {{majority}} white.

The process of party switching {{appears to have been}} slower in Louisiana than in some other Southern states, as Democratic candidates continued to win governorships through the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the <b>black</b> <b>majority.</b> All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister was {{responsible}} for nominating {{the other members of}} the government, chairing meetings of the Rhodesian Cabinet, and deciding when to call a new general election for the House of Assembly. He retained this role following the reconstitution of Rhodesia under <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> rule, first into Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, then into Zimbabwe the following year. The Zimbabwean government was headed by a Prime Minister from 1980 to 1987, when that post was superseded by an executive presidency. The former Prime Minister, Robert Mugabe, became President; as of 2015 he retains this post.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E

5000|$|We {{remember}} the Kerner Report for its searing conclusion that [...] "our nation {{is moving toward}} two societies, one black, one white - separate and unequal."

50|$|By 1977 European {{colonial rule}} in {{mainland}} Africa had ended. Most of Africa's island countries had also become independent, although Réunion and Mayotte remain part of France. However the <b>black</b> <b>majorities</b> in Rhodesia and South Africa were disenfranchised until 1980 in Rhodesia, which became Zimbabwe that year, and until 1994 in South Africa. Namibia, Africa's last UN Trust Territory, became independent of South Africa in 1990.|$|R
5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the <b>black</b> <b>majority.</b> Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{completed}} his studies at Rhodes during 1946, and entered politics in 1948 when he successfully contested the Selukwe seat {{on behalf of}} the Liberal Party, becoming his home town's representative in the Legislative Assembly at the age of 29. He rose through the political ranks with the United Federal Party during the 1950s, and in 1962 helped to form the Rhodesian Front, a right-wing party whose avowed goal was full independence from Britain without an immediate transfer to <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> rule. He became Deputy Prime Minister in December that year when the new party, led by Winston Field, surprised most observers by winning that month's election. After the Cabinet forced Field to resign in April 1964, following his failure to gain independence from Britain, they chose Smith as the new Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{also played}} a key role in the secessionist {{struggle}} against the Portuguese Empire and the struggle for <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> rule in Southern Africa. Control of Somalia was of great interest to both the Soviet Union and the United States, due to the country's strategic location at the mouth of the Red Sea. After the Soviets broke foreign relations with Siad Barre's regime in Somalia, the Soviets turned to the Derg Government in Ethiopia and supported them in their war against Somalia. Because the Soviets changed their allegiance, Barre expelled all Soviet advisers, tore up his friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, and switched allegiance to the West. The United States took the Soviet Union's place in the 1980s in the aftermath of Somalia's loss in the Ogaden War.|$|E
50|$|Congress's {{power to}} legislate for {{implicit}} expatriation of Americans was later heavily restricted by the 1967 case Afroyim v. Rusk, which concluded that natural-born Americans cannot {{be deprived of}} citizenship by any means except a voluntary renunciation {{in the presence of}} a consular official. Associate Justice Hugo <b>Black's</b> <b>majority</b> opinion extensively discussed the Expatriation Act of 1868, including the history of proposed amendments to it.|$|R
5|$|<b>Black's</b> <b>majority</b> {{opinion in}} McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that the}} {{government}} could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the majority opinion in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|R
50|$|The {{wheel in}} the logo {{represents}} the economy. The gold colour {{of the wheel}} represents {{the wealth of the}} country. The figures pushing the wheel, consisting of two men and a women carrying a baby, represent the challenges that workers face namely, racial and gender oppression as well as economic exploitation. These figures are black as they represent the <b>black</b> <b>majorities</b> struggle against racial oppression. The figures are holding a red flag that represents the working class.|$|R
5|$|The affair came {{amid the}} larger dispute between Whitehall and Salisbury {{regarding}} the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence. Rhodesia's mostly white government insisted that statehood should {{come under the}} constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall insisted that a set timetable for the introduction of <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> rule {{would have to be}} in place before the country could be fully independent. The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the Commonwealth, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} to British {{immigrants}} in Selukwe, {{a small town in}} the Southern Rhodesian Midlands, four years before the colony became self-governing in 1923. Serving as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War, he spent months behind German lines in Italy and suffered debilitating facial and bodily wounds that remained conspicuous {{for the rest of his}} life. He set up a farm in his home town in 1948 and, the same year, became Member of Parliament for Selukwe—at 29 years old, the country's youngest ever MP. Originally a Liberal, he defected to the United Federal Party in 1953, and served as Chief Whip from 1958 onwards. He left in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and the following year helped Winston Field to form the all-White, firmly conservative Rhodesian Front (RF), which called for independence without an immediate shift to <b>Black</b> <b>majority</b> rule.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} held a Salisbury {{conference in}} 1961 to determine Southern Rhodesia's future. Nkomo led an NDP delegation, which {{hoped that the}} British would support {{the creation of an}} independent state governed by the <b>black</b> <b>majority.</b> Representatives of the country's white minority—who then controlled Southern Rhodesia's government—were opposed to this, promoting continued white minority rule. Following negotiations, Nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow the black population representation through 15 of the 65 seats in the country's parliament. Mugabe and others in the NDP were furious at Nkomo's compromise. Following the conference, Southern Rhodesia's African nationalist movement fell into disarray. Mugabe spoke at a number of NDP rallies before the party was banned by the government in December 1961. Many of its members re-grouped as the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) several days later, with Mugabe appointed as ZAPU's publicity secretary and general secretary.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, 29.6% of Dominican Americans {{responded that}} they were white, while 12.9% {{considered}} themselves <b>black.</b> A <b>majority</b> of 57.5% chose the category 'Other race'.|$|R

50|$|Until 1992, {{most black}} House members were elected from inner-city {{districts in the}} North and West: New York City, Newark, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis and Los Angeles all elected at least one black member. Following the 1990 census, Congressional districts needed to be redrawn due to the {{population}} shifts of the country. Various federal court decisions resulted in states' creating districts to provide for some {{where the majority of}} the population were African Americans, rather than gerrymandering to exclude <b>black</b> <b>majorities.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Southern Rhodesians {{presumed that}} {{in the event of}} Federal dissolution, they would be first in line for independence, and would receive it without major {{adjustments}} to their 1961 constitution. Indeed, intergovernmental correspondence during early 1963 did much to confirm Salisbury's belief that this was the case. While Federal break-up talks progressed, Sandys issued a letter of intent in which he said that powers conferred on the Federal government by British legislation would transfer to Southern Rhodesia at the end of Federation. It was agreed that Salisbury would keep the Federal overseas missions in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques, as well as the British Embassy desks in Bonn, Tokyo and Washington. Arrangements for Federal dissolution concluded in mid-1963, and the Federation formally ended on 31 December that year. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became independent during 1964, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi, under <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> governments. Southern Rhodesia was denied the same on the grounds that whites held too dominant a position, prompting indignation and fury from the governing Rhodesian Front (RF) and its supporters. Prime Minister Winston Field's failure to secure independence from Britain during early 1964 led to his forced resignation and replacement by his deputy, Ian Smith, in April that year.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bulk}} of the French Navy {{confined}} to port, the British were able to strike directly at French colonies, although their reach was limited by the significant resources required in blockading the French coast and so the size and quality of operations varied widely. In 1804, Haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by the Royal Navy, and in 1806 British forces secured most of the northern coast of South America from its Dutch owners. In 1807 the Danish West Indies were invaded and in 1808 Spain changed sides and allied with Britain, while Cayenne fell to an improvised force under Captain James Lucas Yeo in January 1809. The damage done to the Martinique economy during this period was severe, as British frigates raided coastal towns and shipping, and merchant vessels were prevented from trading Martinique's produce with France or allied islands. Disaffection grew on the island, especially among the recently emancipated <b>black</b> <b>majority,</b> and during the summer of 1808 the island's governor, Vice-amiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, sent urgent messages back to France requesting supplies and reinforcements. Some of these messages were intercepted by British ships and the low morale on Martinique was {{brought to the attention of}} the Admiralty, who ordered their commander on the West Indian Station, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to raise an expeditionary force from the ships and garrisons available to him and invade the island.|$|E
25|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} in the literature that blacks {{are more likely to}} commit violent crimes than are whites in the United States. Whether this is the case for less serious crimes is less clear. <b>Black</b> <b>majority</b> cities have similar crime statistics for blacks as do cities where majority of population is white. For example, white-plurality San Diego has a slightly lower crime rate for blacks than does Atlanta, a city which has <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> in population and city government.|$|E
25|$|Circa 1950 {{the state}} {{legislature}} approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from single-member districts, rather than at-large voting. This change was supported because at-large voting diluted the minority population's political power in the city. They could seldom gain {{a majority of the}} population to support a candidate of their choice. Apportionment under the single-member districts meant that some districts had <b>black</b> <b>majorities.</b> In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African-American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.|$|R
50|$|Jim Clyburn, {{the current}} Democratic South Carolina congressman and Assistant Democratic Leader, is a {{relative}} of Murray. First elected to Congress in 1992 from the South Carolina's 6th congressional district, a new majority-minority district, Clyburn was the first African American to be elected to Congress from the state since George Murray. Demographic changes, including the Great Migration of blacks {{out of the state}} {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, had decreased former <b>black</b> <b>majorities</b> in certain counties and congressional districts prior to blacks' regaining the ability to vote.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, {{gentrification}} {{expanded into}} {{other parts of}} Atlanta, spreading throughout the historic streetcar suburbs east of Downtown and Midtown, areas with <b>black</b> <b>majorities</b> historically such as the Old Fourth Ward, Kirkwood, Reynoldstown and Edgewood as well as Cabbagetown, once populated mostly by working-class whites with Appalachian origins.

25|$|Because {{they had}} {{acquired}} some immunity in their homeland, Africans were {{more resistant to}} these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import African slaves. By about 1708, South Carolina had a <b>black</b> <b>majority.</b> Coastal Georgia developed a <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant. Others lived mostly {{in cities such as}} Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands.|$|E
25|$|Alexandria's {{population}} {{shifted from}} a barely white city to a 55 percent <b>black</b> <b>majority</b> during Randolph's tenure.

50|$|O'Hara was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1871 and started a law practice. The next year, he was elected chairman of the Halifax County board of commissioners, serving 1872-1876. Halifax and nearby counties of the northeast part of the state had <b>black</b> <b>majorities,</b> and were included within North Carolina's 2nd congressional district. By 1877 New Bern, the major population center, was a black-majority city.
