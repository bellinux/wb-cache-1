5|$|Few records survive of the Brill <b>Brick</b> <b>and</b> Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill <b>Brick</b> <b>and</b> Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill <b>Brick</b> <b>and</b> Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bricks</b> <b>and</b> clicks (aka clicks <b>and</b> <b>bricks,</b> click <b>and</b> mortar, <b>bricks,</b> clicks <b>and</b> flips, Womble Store Method (WSM) or WAMBAM) is a jargon {{term for}} a {{business}} model by which a company integrates both offline (<b>bricks)</b> <b>and</b> online (clicks) presences, sometimes with the third extra flips (physical catalogs). Additionally, many will also offer telephone ordering and mobile phone apps, or at least provide telephone sales support. The advent of mobile web has made businesses operating <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> clicks businesses especially popular, because it means customers can do tasks like shopping when they have spare time {{and do not have}} to be at a computer. Many of these users prefer to use mobile shopping sites.|$|R

[...] It {{has been argued}} that a <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> clicks business model is more difficult to implement than an online only model. In the future, the <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> clicks model may be more successful, but in 2010 some online only businesses grew at a staggering 30%, while some <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> clicks businesses grew at a paltry 3%.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} study is to {{investigate}} about the potential use of coal fly ash along with other natural and solid wastes {{for the production of}} coal fly ash based <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> roof tiles. The study is based on the comprehensive reviews available from the previous experimental data on coal fly ash based <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> roof tiles. The study intendeds to provide the essential technical information and data for the use of fly ash mix with other solid wastes and reveal their suitability as construction materials. It has been found that samples were non-hazardous in nature and vigorously used as an additional construction materials and their compositions are perfectly fit to make the strong composite material for <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> tiles. The three past studies have been demonstrated that, fly ash based <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> roof tiles provides a sustainable supplement to the traditional clay <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> roof tiles, that not only increases the efficiency of traditional <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> roof tiles but also helps significantly to reduce the environmental issues associated with the disposal of these waste materials.
