500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] has vocoder effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of [...] "nobody knows me" [...] while she ponders thoughts like, [...] "It's no good when you're misunderstood, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I care what the world thinks of me?". O'Brien {{described it as a}} trancey track with a sense of childlike defiant lyrics, dismissing critics who have no knowledge of her [...] "jealously guarded inner self".|$|E
500|$|Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz {{describe}} {{mixed emotions}} about the religiosity of the poem. Cowley emphasised the mystical {{nature of the}} poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation {{of many of the}} passages. Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding. F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem caused [...] "Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote, and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets." [...] E. M. Forster did not like Eliot's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem: [...] "Of course there's pain on and off through each individual's life... You can't shirk it and so on. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer." [...] Writing in 2003, Roger Scruton wrote that in [...] "Little Gidding" [...] Eliot achieved [...] "that for which he envies Dante—namely, a poetry of belief, in which belief and words are one, and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language".|$|E

He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I know {{perfectly}} well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E

2500|$|As MNQ president, Simard {{argued that}} francophone Quebecers were unfairly {{singled out by}} Canadian federalists for having condoned racist and xenophobic {{behaviour}} in earlier times. In {{the wake of a}} public controversy over Esther Delisle's The Traitor and the Jew, which addressed historical anti-Semitism and Quebec nationalism, Simard said, [...] "Of course we denounce all forms of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, and we don't excuse it even fifty years later. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> we have to respond to [...] attacks that are obviously politically motivated?" [...] Unlike other Quebec sovereigntist groups, the MNQ under Simard's leadership sought to build links with francophone groups across Canada.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the academic year, Yale held its annual [...] "tap-day" [...] custom in which juniors were selected for the school's three senior societies -- Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head. [...] By tradition, the captain of Yale's football team was tapped to join Skull and Bones. [...] However, in May 1905, Shevlin was snubbed by all three societies, resulting in a public furor. [...] After the public snubbing, Shevlin reportedly [...] "left the campus and whirled away in his automobile." [...] One newspaper speculated that Shevlin's automobile was the reason for the snub:"Can it be true that Tom Shevlin, Jr. ... missed being 'tapped' for one of the senior societies merely because he had just become the possessor of a fine, new automobile and was putting on a good deal of style with it? [...] It is true that he was not 'tapped;' equally true that he whirled up to the 'tapping' place in a splendid automobile, <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> the possession of a 40-horse power horseless wagon militate against a student who desires to be 'tapped' and is entitled to the distinction? ... Evidently because he had made himself unpopular and in some way the cause of the unpopularity was the splendid touring car. [...] Other automobiles there are at Yale, but the Minnesota boy had the best machine in the bunch. [...] Envy may {{have had something to do}} with the shabby treatment handed out to young Shevlin."There were also suggestions that it was the reckless manner in which Shevlin drove his car that led to his being snubbed. [...] Shevlin had also drawn attention in 1904 when traveling to England as part of the Harvard-Yale track team; his decision to stay at a different hotel than the team reportedly [...] "cost him considerable of his rather meager popularity." [...] According to another story, Shevlin had placed a $100 bet that he would be tapped by Skull and Bones, and when word of the bet reached the group, they declined to have him.|$|E
