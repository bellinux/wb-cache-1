5|$|<b>Benin</b> {{participated in}} eight summer Olympic games between {{its debut in}} the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Competing under the name Dahomey, <b>Benin</b> made their Olympic debut in 1972, sending two athletes to the games. The most number of <b>Benin</b> athletes {{participating}} in a summer games, is 16 in the 1980 games in Moscow. Five athletes from <b>Benin</b> were selected {{to compete in the}} 2008 games: track and field athletes Fabienne Feraez and Mathieu Gnanligo; swimmers Alois Dansou and Gloria Koussihouede; and taekwondo practitioner Jean Moloise Ogoudjobi.|$|E
5|$|<b>Benin</b> {{took part}} in the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008. The country's {{participation}} at Beijing marked its eighth consecutive appearance in the summer Olympics since its debut in 1972, and its ninth Olympic appearance ever. The <b>Benin</b> delegation included five athletes in 2008, participating in three sports: athletics, swimming and taekwondo. Fabienne Feraez, a sprinter, was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. None of the <b>Benin</b> athletes progressed further than the heat round.|$|E
5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of <b>Benin,</b> for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of <b>Benin.</b> Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of <b>Benin</b> today.|$|E

5|$|<b>Benin</b> had one taekwondo {{practitioner}} {{competing in}} the 2008 Olympics. This man was Jean Moloise Ogoudjobi, a 28-year-old Beninese athlete, competing at his first Olympic Games. Moloise Ogoudjobi fought in match three against Chutchawal Khawlaor from Thailand in the first round. Moloise Ogoudjobi lost and did not progress to the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Colonization and {{expansion}} {{of the kingdom of}} Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi, or converts, to other settlements. Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath. Religious authority was vested in the local king, and ties were maintained by traveling mbùríchi. By the 14th century, Nri influence extended well beyond the nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on {{the west bank of the}} Niger and communities affected by the <b>Benin</b> Empire. There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence well beyond the Igbo region to <b>Benin</b> and Southern Igala areas like Idah. At its height, the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and beyond. It reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast {{were drawn}} {{in a group}} with Nigeria, Mali and underdogs <b>Benin.</b> Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4–1 win over <b>Benin,</b> {{as well as in}} the 3–0 win over Mali. In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to be the end of the road for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4–1 to the {{eventual}} champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} Nri had an artistic {{as well as}} {{religious}} influence on the lower Niger. Sculptures found there are bronze like those at Igbo-Ukwu. The great sculptures of the <b>Benin</b> Empire, by contrast, were almost always brass with, over time, increasingly greater percentages of zinc added.|$|E
5|$|A. b. major (Blyth, 1869) : Known as {{the western}} hartebeest. Formerly {{occurred}} widely in Mali, Niger, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, southwestern Chad, Cameroon, western Central African Republic and <b>Benin.</b> Nowadays {{it occurs in}} much lower numbers mainly in protected areas of these countries. It is probably extinct in Gambia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Benin</b> had {{one woman}} {{competing}} in swimming at the 2008 Olympics. That athlete was Gloria Koussihouede who {{competed in the}} 50 meters freestyle. The 2008 Olympics was Koussihouedes second Olympics after competing in 2004, and she was selected to compete in heat one. Koussihouede finished second in her heat {{in a time of}} 37.09seconds, behind Sameera Al-Bitar and ahead of Pamela Girimbabazi Rugabira and Djene Barry. Her time placed her 87th out of 90 athletes and she did not qualify for the semi-finals.|$|E

This book was published in 1980, and Werner Herzog's film, Cobra Verde (1987), is based on it.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is one of}} {{the three}} colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the color on their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, <b>Benin,</b> and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E
5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with the recent history of both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps calling attention to the campaign against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in <b>Benin,</b> Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|Northwest African cheetah (A. j. hecki) (Hilzheimer, 1913): Also {{called the}} Saharan cheetah. Found in northwestern Africa; the IUCN {{confirms}} {{its presence in}} only four countries: Algeria, <b>Benin,</b> Burkina Faso and Niger. Small populations are known {{to exist in the}} Ahaggar and Tassili N'Ajjer National Parks (Algeria); a 2003 study estimated a population of 20 to 40 individuals in Ahaggar National Park. In Niger, cheetahs have been reported from the Aïr Mountains, Ténéré, Termit Massif, Talak and Azaouak valley. A 1993 study reported a population of 50 from Ténéré. In <b>Benin,</b> the cheetah still survives in Pendjari National Park and W National Park. The status is obscure in Burkina Faso, where individuals may be confined to the southeastern region. With the total world population estimated at less than 250 mature individuals, it is listed as Critically Endangered.|$|E
5|$|Oyo, at its {{territorial}} zenith in {{the late}} 17th to early 18th centuries, extended its influence from western Nigeria to modern-day Togo. The Edo's <b>Benin</b> Empire is located in southwestern Nigeria. Benin's power lasted between the 15th and 19th centuries. Their dominance reached {{as far as the}} city of Eko (an Edo name later changed to Lagos by the Portuguese) and further.|$|E
5|$|The A3, or the Enugu-Port Harcourt highway, {{was opened}} in the 1970s and links the two cities {{together}} by passing through Aba, a major urban settlement. The A3 goes further on past Enugu's north to link {{to the city of}} Jos via Makurdi. Two more highways, the A232 from <b>Benin</b> City, Asaba and Onitsha to Enugu's east and the A343 from Abakaliki to Enugu's west, makes Enugu the site of a major junction.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra occurs {{mainly in}} western and central Africa. It is found from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, southeastern Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, <b>Benin,</b> Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and Gabon in western Africa to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and {{northern}} Angola in central Africa to western Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in eastern Africa, and to fragmented parts of southern Africa, including the Natal.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{appears to}} have passed its peak in the 14th century, encroached upon {{by the rise of}} the <b>Benin</b> and Igala kingdom, and later the Atlantic slave trade, but it {{appears to have}} {{maintained}} its authority well into the 16th century, and remnants of the eze hierarchy persisted until the establishment of Colonial Nigeria in 1911 and represents one of the traditional states within modern Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|The legume vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of <b>Benin</b> and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).|$|E
5|$|Competing at {{her second}} Olympics, Fabienne Feraez {{was the oldest}} {{competitor}} for <b>Benin,</b> aged 32. She competed in the 200meters on 19 August. Feraez, who also competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics, was drawn into heat three. Feraez ran a time of 24.07seconds and finished last in her heat, exactly asecond behind the winner, Marshevet Myers. She finished 40th out of 46 athletes overall and was 8.09seconds faster than the slowest athlete, Samia Yusuf Omar.

5|$|Endemic to Africa, the bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} <b>Benin,</b> Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Formerly widespread in western, central and eastern Africa, its present range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Among the three reedbuck species, bohor reedbuck is the most widespread in Tanzania. Its status in Burundi, Eritrea, Ghana and Togo is uncertain, while it is rare in Niger and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia and Morocco {{are home}} to the most with nine sites; {{followed}} by Tunisia and South Africa at eight sites; and Algeria, Egypt, Senegal, and Tanzania at seven. Eleven countries have only a single site each. Four sites are shared between two countries: Maloti-Drakensberg Park (Lesotho and South Africa), the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve (Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea), the Stone Circles of Senegambia (the Gambia and Senegal), and the Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls (Zambia and Zimbabwe). Two sites are shared among three countries, Sangha Trinational (Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Congo) and W-Arly-Penjari Complex (<b>Benin,</b> Burkina Faso, and Niger).|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Brown {{served as}} a Fulbright {{lecturer}} at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member of George Washington University until her death in 1976. In 1972, Brown travelled again, this time to African cities which include Gao, Cairo, Segou, Marrakesh, Timbuktu, Fez, Ibandan, <b>Benin,</b> Axum, Kumasi and Luxor.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as <b>Benin</b> and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} very common and is {{widespread}} through much of sub-Saharan Africa and is found in western, eastern, central, and parts of southern Africa. It is absent from the rainforests of the Congo Basin. It has been recorded from Angola, <b>Benin,</b> Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (except in the center), Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Sudan, Tanzania, Somalia, Togo, Uganda, Zambia. Older records from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique, or most of Namibia refer to Naja mossambica or Naja nigricincta, which were formerly regarded as subspecies of N.nigricollis.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} temples of Sai Baba in India. Temples are also located in {{countries}} outside India, including the United States, Netherlands, Kenya, <b>Benin,</b> Cuba, Canada, Pakistan, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and New Zealand. Present in the mosque in Shirdi in which Sai Baba lived, is a life-size portrait of him by Shama Rao Jaykar, an artist from Mumbai. Numerous monuments and statues depicting Sai Baba which serve a religious function have been made. One of them, made of marble by a sculptor named Balaji Vasant Talim, {{is in the}} Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi where Sai Baba was buried.|$|E
5|$|Throughout West Africa, ASL-based sign {{languages}} are spoken by educated Deaf adults. These languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations {{to be the}} official sign languages of their countries, and are named accordingly, e.g. Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language. Such signing systems are found in <b>Benin,</b> Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo. Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar these sign {{languages are}} to the variety of ASL used in America.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, British {{claims to}} a West African sphere of {{influence}} received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company {{under the leadership of}} Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came {{under the control of the}} British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered <b>Benin</b> in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.|$|E
5|$|Kagame has {{received}} many honours and accolades during his presidency. These include honorary {{degrees from the}} American University of the Pacific, Oklahoma Christian University, and the University of Glasgow, the Andrew Young Medal for Capitalism and Social Progress by Georgia State University, and a Clinton Global Citizen Award. Kagame has also received the highest awards bestowed by the countries of Liberia and <b>Benin,</b> the Distinction of the Grand Cordon in the Most Venerable Order of the Knighthood of Pioneers, and the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit respectively. In September 2010, the British magazine New Statesman named Kagame one of its 50 most influential figures for that year, placing him in 49th place. The Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations football tournament has been named the Kagame Interclub Cup since 2002, due to Kagame's sponsorship of the event.|$|E
5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. The bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} <b>Benin,</b> Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Reckless hunting and loss of habitat {{as a result of}} human settlement have led to significant decline in the numbers of the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. The total populations of the bohor reedbuck are estimated to be above 100,000. Larger populations occur in eastern and central Africa than in western Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained}} {{a close relationship}} with France, a policy known as Françafrique, and he built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments. He aided the conspirators who ousted Kwame Nkrumah from power in Ghana in 1966, took part in the failed coup against Mathieu Kérékou in <b>Benin</b> in 1977, and was suspected of involvement in the 1987 coup that removed Thomas Sankara from power in Burkina Faso. Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained a}} strong anti-communist foreign policy, which resulted in, among other things, severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China until 1983. He provided assistance to UNITA, a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in Angola. In 1986 he re-established relations with the Soviet Union, shortly before the fall of its confederation.|$|E
5|$|After Wizkid tweeted a {{subliminal}} {{message and}} tweaked his Twitter account, reports about his departure from E.M.E went viral. Wizkid {{moved out of}} the E.M.E mansion in Lagos and acquired his own home in the Lekki Phase 1 area. Prior to Wizkid's subliminal tweets, Banky W pacified fans by assuring them that nothing was amiss. Furthermore, it was reported that troubles within E.M.E started as early as the 2012 E.M.E all stars concert. It was also reported that money was at the centre of the controversy. On 20 February 2013, Information Nigeria reported that Wizkid was getting 25 percent from every performance, while Banky W and Segun Demuren were getting 50 percent. Osagie, Wizkid's former manager, was getting the remaining 25 percent. After firing Osagie and hiring Godwin Tom (whom he parted ways with in April 2014), Wizkid wanted a 50–50 share with Banky W. The source revealed that Banky W refused to accept Wizkid's proposal. Moreover, it was reported that Banky W wanted to find a manager for Wizkid who would accept 25 percent. It was also reported that things started getting sour as a result of both parties disagreement. Information Nigeria went on to report that Wizkid was doing three shows weekly and bringing in close to ₦24 million monthly. On 30 April 2013, Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that Wizkid and E.M.E reunited after contract negotiations. The news source also reported that Wizkid performed alongside label mates Shaydee and DJ Xclusive in The Republic of <b>Benin.</b> In August 2014, Wizkid told Olisa Adibua that he will depart the label following the release of his second studio album, Ayo.|$|E
5|$|Chamakh is a Moroccan {{international}} at {{the senior}} level. Prior to representing Morocco, he played for the under-19 team of France and made his debut on 12 February 2003 in a friendly match against the Czech Republic. That was his only appearance with the team. Chamakh was then selected within the French squad for the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, but declined the offer after being called up by Moroccan national team coach Badou Zaki for the team's 2004 African Cup of Nations qualification matches against Sierra Leone and Gabon. On 7 June 2003, he made his debut with the team in the match against Sierra Leone. On 10 September 2003, Chamakh scored both goals, which included his first international goal, in a 2–0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago. He participated {{in the rest of}} the qualification matches and was later named to participate in the tournament. Chamakh scored two goals in the competition; one against <b>Benin</b> in the group stage and another in the quarter-finals against Algeria. Morocco beat Mali in the semi-finals to reach the final where they faced Tunisia. In the match, Chamakh played the entire contest as Morocco were defeated 2–1 at the Stade 7 Novembre in Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of <b>Benin</b> and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
