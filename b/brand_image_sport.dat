Following a qualitative approach, the discourses of the participants of seven different water sports were analysed.

Conflicts were found at three levels. First, at a sport practice level, where conflict can arise between the different sports held in and around marinas. Second, at a socio-economic level, conflicts can arise between the different social groups that use marinas. Third, at a tourism level, conflict can arise between tourism development and the use of marinas as a sporting venue.
