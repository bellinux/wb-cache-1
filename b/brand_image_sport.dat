Following a qualitative approach, the discourses of the participants of seven different water sports were analysed.

Conflicts were found at three levels. First, at a sport practice level, where conflict can arise between the different sports held in and around marinas. Second, at a socio-economic level, conflicts can arise between the different social groups that use marinas.

Past studies paid less attention to empirically determine {{the relationship between the}} said variables on <b>brand</b> <b>image</b> and using <b>brand</b> trust as mediator between such independent and dependent variables. Therefore, this study aims to fill up this gap and contribute to the body of knowledge by examining the relationship between them. Data is collected using questionnaire from 287 passenger car users at shopping malls in Northern region of Malaysia. Specifically, systematic sampling procedure was followed during data collection. The data is analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS).
