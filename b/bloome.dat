5|$|The regular cast is {{introduced}} in season one, with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar. Smallvilles first season primarily dealt with Clark Kent's {{coming to terms}} with his alien origin and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the death of Lana Lang's parents. After the first season the series had fewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing instead on individual-character story arcs and exploring Clark's origins. Major storylines include Clark's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex Luthor's escalating conflict with his father, Lionel. The disembodied voice of Clark's father, Jor-El, {{is introduced}}; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship, setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark's earthly destiny. In a fourth-season arc Clark, instructed by Jor-El, searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude. Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod, and must capture (or destroy) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals. His cousin Kara arrives, and Lex Luthor discovers Clark's secret. The eighth season introduces Davis <b>Bloome</b> (Smallvilles version of Doomsday), and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor. Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) after being a recurring guest in season six. In the ninth season Major Zod (Callum Blue) and other members of Zod's military group are revived (without their Kryptonian powers) by Tess Mercer, and their efforts to regain their powers are the season's central conflict. The final season revolves around Clark's attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be, while confronting his biggest challenges: the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor.|$|E
25|$|This season {{focuses on}} Clark Kent {{as he starts}} {{his job at the}} Daily Planet, begins to accept more of his destiny as Earth's hero, and {{develops}} romantic feelings for Lois Lane. While Lex Luthor is presumed dead, and Lana Lang has left Smallville for good, Clark also meets new characters Davis <b>Bloome,</b> Smallvilles interpretation of Doomsday, as well as the new CEO of LuthorCorp, Tess Mercer. In other storylines, Clark and Oliver Queen clash over how to handle Lex when he resurfaces, while Chloe Sullivan and Jimmy Olsen take their relationship to the next level. In addition, this season sees the appearance of more DC Comics characters, including recurring appearances from Plastique and members of the Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Witwer plays Davis <b>Bloome</b> {{in season}} eight. A [...] "charismatic" [...] {{paramedic}} struggling with inner darkness, Davis <b>Bloome</b> is Smallvilles version of Doomsday (the only character to kill Superman). Davis {{would come to}} resemble his comic-book counterpart {{over the course of}} the season. Brian Peterson said that with Michael Rosenbaum's departure, the new executive producers were looking for a villain [...] "as great as Lex" [...] and Doomsday fit the bill.|$|E
50|$|Their flirtatious attentions {{have the}} effect of bolstering <b>Bloome's</b> ego and he quickly grows in {{confidence}} and stature, finally answering back to Price-Hargreaves and even suggesting revolutionary improvements that greatly increase sales thus drawing the attention of Chunkibix company owner, Lady Chesapeake.|$|R

This {{rendered}} Dan fully untransformable {{and was forced}} to rely on the Ultra Physic to assist Leo in his battles. The Ultra Eye was later claimed by Ultraman Jack and brought to the Land of Light when the Mother of Ultra rescued Dan from Silver <b>Bloome's</b> attack, healing his injuries and presented him the fixed Ultra Eye for him to become Seven once more.|$|R
500|$|Davis is {{actually}} Smallvilles {{interpretation of the}} comic book character Doomsday, the only character to have succeeded at killing Superman. In Smallville, Doomsday is represented as a [...] "nice guy" [...] paramedic, who grew up moving from foster home to foster home. His storyline is considered [...] "very dark" [...] in that the character uncovers horrible truths about himself as season eight progresses. Brian Peterson explained that he, {{and the rest of}} the new executive producers, were looking for a villainous character that was [...] "as great as Lex", with Michael Rosenbaum's departure at the end of the seventh season, and Doomsday fit what they were looking for. Although Witwer portrays Davis <b>Bloome,</b> who becomes the creature known as Doomsday, he does not actually wear the prosthetic body suit that was created for when Davis transforms into his monstrous counterpart. Instead Dario Delacio, a stunt double, who stands at 6-foot-8, performs the role of [...] "Doomsday" [...] when the creature appears throughout the season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} eight premiere, it is {{revealed}} that the Veritas device does not allow others to control Clark, but rather strips him of his powers. Wandering the globe with Russian gangsters, Clark is eventually found and rescued by Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) and John Jones, with the latter restoring Clarks powers. During season eight, Clark uses his new job at the Daily Planet to access advance information, which he uses to stop crime around the city. In subsequent episodes, Clark adopts the name [...] "Red-Blue Blur" [...] as his superhero moniker. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Clark wrestles with the idea of having to kill Davis <b>Bloome</b> (Sam Witwer), a new friend, after discovering that Davis is actually Doomsday, a genetically engineered creature created by General Zod to kill Clark and destroy Earth. In the season eight finale, Clark finds a way to separate Davis' personality from that of Doomsday, and buries Doomsday a mile underground. When Davis subsequently kills Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), Clark decides that his human-learned emotions have caused him the most trouble, as it was his compassion for Davis that led to Jimmy's death. He vows that [...] "Clark Kent is dead".|$|E
500|$|After being {{saved by}} Oliver Queen and Clark {{in the season}} eight premiere, Chloe is reunited with Jimmy and accepts his {{marriage}} proposal. In [...] "Committed", a deranged jeweler kidnaps Jimmy and Chloe after their engagement party and subjects them to a torturous test {{to see if they}} truly love each other—they both pass and are allowed to return to their normal lives. In the season eight episode [...] "Identity", Jimmy begins to suspect that Clark is the [...] "Good Samaritan", an individual who has been stopping crimes and saving people's lives around Metropolis, until Oliver Queen dresses up as the [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] to help Clark trick Jimmy into believing he was mistaken. In the eighth-season episode [...] "Bride", Jimmy and Chloe are officially married, but Doomsday crashes their wedding and kidnaps Chloe, leaving Jimmy in the hospital because of injuries sustained from Doomsday. In [...] "Turbulence", Jimmy witnesses Davis <b>Bloome</b> murdering someone, but when he tries to warn people Davis drugs him and makes it appear as though he is hallucinating. Eventually, Jimmy ends his marriage to Chloe after getting fed up with her always taking Davis's side. In the season eight finale, Davis murders Jimmy after learning that Chloe is still in love with her ex-husband, and was never in love with him.|$|E

Focusing {{on the language}} and tools mature students employ in exploring in interviews their orientations, satisfaction and outcomes of learning at the university, this analysis proposes a socio-cultural perspective to forming {{an understanding of how}} they experience learning and form an understanding of themselves whilst at university. To this end, reference is made to the analytical tools provided by Davis and Harré’s positioning theory (1990) and <b>Bloome's</b> chronotopical analysis (2009) developed from Bakhtin's notion of chronotope (1981) ...|$|R
500|$|At {{the start}} of season eight, it is {{revealed}} that Chloe was not arrested by DDS, but Lex's security personnel impersonating DDS agents. While subjected to their tests, Chloe discovers that her altercation with Brainiac has apparently caused to her to lose her meteor-related powers, but instilled two new abilities: vast super intelligence and technopathy. Returning to Smallville, Chloe reopens the Isis Foundation. Though she loves Jimmy, she finds herself attracted to paramedic Davis <b>Bloome</b> (Samuel Witwer). In the episode [...] "Abyss", Brainiac's infestation causes Chloe to lose her memories. Clark takes Chloe to his biological father Jor-El, who restores her memories. After Chloe marries Jimmy in [...] "Bride", she is kidnapped by Doomsday, a genetically engineered killing machine bent on destroying Earth and becomes Brainiac's vessel once again. Brainiac attempts to drain the world of all its human knowledge but is stopped and removed from Chloe's body by the Legion, superheroes from the future, in [...] "Legion". In [...] "Hex", Chloe assumes the codename Watchtower full time because she feels her life needs more meaning. Chloe discovers that Davis is Doomsday in [...] "Eternal". She attempts to assist Davis' suicide using kryptonite; when this fails, she stays by his side {{in order to keep}} Doomsday under control. In the episode [...] "Beast", she and Davis leave town together; Chloe reasons it will protect Clark. In the season eight finale, she uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday; Clark buries Doomsday beneath Metropolis. However, when Davis discovers that Chloe is still in love with Jimmy, he stabs Jimmy and attempts to kill Chloe; Jimmy impales him on a metal rod, and they both die. Chloe vows to keep the Watchtower Jimmy gave her as a wedding gift open, in the hope that all lost heroes—namely Oliver and his team—will find their way home.|$|E
500|$|Sam Witwer portrays Davis <b>Bloome,</b> a {{paramedic}} for Metropolis General Hospital. He first {{appears in the}} season eight episode [...] "Plastique", assisting Chloe with helping an injured person after a bomb explosion. In the episode [...] "Toxic", Chloe calls on his help when Oliver is poisoned and refuses {{to be taken to}} a hospital. In [...] "Prey", Clark begins to suspect that Davis is a serial killer after he finds Davis unconscious at one of the murder scenes, and learns later that Davis is usually the first paramedic to arrive on similar scenes. Davis starts to suspect the same thing himself when he begins to lose track of large portions of time, and finds himself covered in blood, but with no wounds on his own body. Davis is informed by Faora, the wife of General Zod, that after the pair learned they could not have children that he was genetically created to adapt to any injury and to be Earth's ultimate destroyer. In [...] "Abyss", Davis confesses to Chloe that he is in love with her, and believes that she is marrying the wrong man; as a result she asks him to not see her again. On Chloe's wedding day, in the episode [...] "Bride", Davis transforms into the hulking monster called Doomsday, and travels to Smallville where he injures Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. In the episode [...] "Infamous", Davis discovers that he can keep Doomsday from emerging if he kills, and subsequently begins choosing criminals as his victims. He subsequently learns that Chloe's presence will also keep the monster at bay in the episode [...] "Turbulence", and in [...] "Beast" [...] Davis and Chloe leave town together so that Davis can keep Doomsday from coming out. In the season eight finale, Chloe uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday, leaving him human; when Davis discovers that Chloe does not love him he stabs Jimmy with a pipe. Before Davis can attack Chloe, Jimmy pushes him into a metal rod, which results in Davis's death before Jimmy himself dies.|$|E
2500|$|There are two new {{characters}} {{added to}} the show as series regulars, Tess Mercer and Davis <b>Bloome.</b> The name [...] "Tess Mercer" [...] is a homage to two characters from Superman lore, Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves. As Freeman describes her character, Tess Mercer is Lex's handpicked successor; she is [...] "fierce", [...] "fun" [...] and intelligent. Tess Mercer's primary goal for this season was finding Lex, which drew her inquisitively to Clark, who she believed {{would be able to}} help her. Darren Swimmer revealed that Tess would develop a romantic interest in Clark as well. Davis <b>Bloome</b> would actually be Smallvilles interpretation of Doomsday, the only character to have succeeded at killing Superman. In Smallville, Doomsday was represented by a [...] "nice guy" [...] paramedic, who grew up moving from foster home to foster home.

2500|$|With Justin Hartley {{added as}} a series regular, Smallville would explore more of his backstory, {{including}} why he chose to become Green Arrow, how he accomplished it, and how he became good at archery. This season would also explore more of the friendship between Oliver Queen and Clark. Oliver would be broken down emotionally—questioning whether he {{made the right choice}} to sacrifice all for the sake of being Green Arrow—and that causes him to [...] "butt heads" [...] with Clark, who is beginning to embrace his destiny. Allison Mack's character, Chloe Sullivan, would have more romantic interests this season. Not only would the character still have Jimmy Olsen, but there is still the question of her romantic interest in Clark, as well as a new interest in the character of Davis <b>Bloome.</b> Mack's character would also be picking up the Isis Foundation, a counseling center for people infected by kryptonite, that Lana founded before she left Smallville. Mack explained that Chloe would be forging her own destiny this season, and letting Clark learn to deal with problems on his own—previous seasons saw Clark relying heavily on Chloe to help solve the crime.|$|E
6000|$|Of the {{transactions}} of our adventurers with the savages, {{and how the}} latter smoked copper pipes and ate dried currants; how they brought great store of tobacco and oysters; how they shot one of the ship's crew, {{and how he was}} buried, I shall say nothing, being that I consider them unimportant to my history. After tarrying a few days in the bay, in order to refresh themselves after their seafaring, our voyagers weighed anchor, to explore a mighty river which emptied into the bay. This river, it is said, was known among the savages by the name of the Shatemuck; though we are assured in an excellent little history published in 1674, by John Josselyn, gent., that it was called the Mohegan;[23] and Master Richard <b>Bloome,</b> who wrote some time afterwards, asserts the same--so that I very much incline in favor of the opinion of these two honest gentlemen. Be this as it may, up this river did the adventurous Hendrick proceed, little doubting but it would turn to be the much-looked-for passage to China! ...|$|E

50|$|Jimmy Edwards played Price-Hargreaves in his {{trademark}} blustery harumphing way, that was easily recognised from {{his role as}} the headmaster in Whack-O!. Sykes played <b>Bloome,</b> the eponymous mouse of the show’s title. Throughout the show the one ability that marked the boss’s dominance in the office was his practised skill in picking up his phone handset by chopping with his hand, causing the handset to leap off the cradle into his waiting hand. <b>Bloome,</b> trying to emulate this, would always fail with the trick, either hurting his hand or sending the handset spinning into a waste paper basket. Only when he has gained confidence after being accused does he succeed, grinning widely at the audience.|$|E

50|$|From 2008 to 2009, Witwer {{was cast}} in Season 8 of Smallville as Davis <b>Bloome,</b> a charming {{paramedic}} who struggles with a darkness within as he is the human camouflage of Doomsday, a character in the comics best known for being the only villain to have killed Superman. While Witwer played Davis, Doomsday was played by stuntman Dario Delacio.

He was also Gen Ohtori-Ultraman Leo's instructor after incapable of transforming into Seven due to the injuries from fighting Alien Magma and his Giras monsters. As a MAC officer, Dan's main weapon is a rifle-smokescreen hidden within his Lofstrand crutch.

50|$|At one point, {{during what}} is {{supposed}} to be a serious solo scene by Sykes, Edwards could be seen by the audience in his shirtsleeves and braces relaxing in the wings on an armchair. He is smoking a cigarette, flicking over pages of the play's script and making occasional wry faces at Sykes's performance, while Sykes feigns puzzlement at the audience's laughter. During the mid-play interval the cast joined the audience in the bar, remaining in character and performing several hilarious set piece conversations in between chatting with theatre goers. The office secretary, Miss Spencer, who works for both men, starts the play as a shy drab and dowdily dressed spinster, but when <b>Bloome</b> gains his undeserved reputation and she herself is smitten by him, she also starts to blossom seemingly unnoticed. In the classic Sykes-Edwards production, the young actress playing the part endured endless ad-libs and delays in the action and still resolutely hit her cues and scripted lines. She became the stable point of reference around which the anarchic comics wove their magic. In the final act, having confessed her love for <b>Bloome</b> while wearing a drab ankle-length dress with a high lace collar, she next appears in a sexy red leather mini-skirt and boots, much to the delight of the audience who have appreciated her professional contribution to the performance.|$|E

Dan parted ways with Gen and vanished, leaving Gen {{to escape from the}} destroyed base as Leo.
