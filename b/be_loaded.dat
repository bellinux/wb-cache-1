5|$|In 1890 movable tipping hoists {{mounted on}} rails were {{installed}} so that coal could <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> simultaneously into one hold from a fixed hoist and another hold from the movable hoist.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> {{from the end of}} the barrel. Before it could <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|Amey Roadstone (formerly T R Brown and Holms Sand & Gravel) sand {{dredgers}} {{worked from}} Poole's Wharf in Hotwells until 1991. Occasionally coastal trading vessels enter the Cumberland Basin to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> with large steel silos manufactured by Braby Ltd at their nearby Ashton Gate works.|$|E

5|$|The coaster {{features}} a dual station which {{is connected to}} the main track using a switch track segment (similar to a railroad switch). Dual-station operation allows for two trains to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> simultaneously for more efficient operation. This configuration existed since the ride debuted at Geauga Lake.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may <b>be,</b> <b>loaded.</b> Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased Sapphire. Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E

50|$|The typical {{operating}} {{system for the}} Model 25 was DOS/360, which <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> from disk.Less common was TOS/360, which <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> from tape, and, rarely, BOS/360, which <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> from punched cards. Programming was mostly in the COBOL, RPG and Assembler languages for the commercial applications that were the predominant uses of this computer, but Fortran {{could also be used}} for the scientific and engineering applications.|$|R
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and which would <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport {{them across the}} North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to <b>be</b> <b>loaded.</b> In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
50|$|The code above {{does not}} use the cache very well. During the {{calculation}} of a horizontal stripe of C results, one horizontal stripe of B <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> and the entire matrix A <b>is</b> <b>loaded.</b> For the entire calculation, C is stored once (that's good), B <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> into the cache once (assuming a stripe of B fits in the cache with a stripe of A), but A <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> N/ib times, where ib {{is the size of}} the strip in the C matrix, for a total of N3/ib doubleword loads from main memory. In the code above, ib is 2.|$|R

5|$|The assault {{troops with}} their {{supplies}} and equipment had to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> {{on board the}} ships on 31 December 1943, just {{five days after the}} assault on Cape Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised {{in the light of the}} reduced number of landing craft.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> in the bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
30|$|The machine {{used in this}} {{experiment}} was Instron 5582. The samples <b>were</b> <b>loaded</b> to failure at 1 Â mm/min. The maximum <b>load</b> <b>was</b> the failure <b>load.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mauser C6 is a pistol. It was {{manufactured}} in 1906 {{as a replacement}} for the clip loading C96. This pistol was the second pistol that <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> with a magazine. It <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> with 10 bullets of 7.63x25mm mauser(.30).|$|R
50|$|In March 1983, the Commandant of the Marine Corps {{directed}} Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany {{to acquire}} the assets for the MPF program. MSC leased thirteen ships for the MPF program. The ships were formed into three Maritime Prepositioning Squadrons (MPSRONs). MPSRON 1 and 2 <b>were</b> <b>loaded</b> in Wilmington, North Carolina and MPSRON 3 <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> in Panama City, Florida. The ammunition for all three squadrons <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> at Military Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point, North Carolina.|$|R
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|It was {{important}} {{to keep track of}} the amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally of the weight of the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a levered platform, superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890. Ships were loaded quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E
5|$|North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, {{starting}} the Korean War. In {{response to an}} urgent request from the Korean Military Advisory Group for more ammunition, MacArthur, on his own initiative, ordered the transport ship MSTS Sgt. George D Keathley, then in harbor in Yokohama, to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> with ammunition and to sail for Pusan. President Truman met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other advisors that day at Blair House and approved the actions already taken by MacArthur and Secretary of State Dean Acheson. At another meeting at Blair House held {{on the evening of}} 26 June, amid reports of a rapidly deteriorating situation in South Korea, Truman approved the use of air and naval forces against military targets south of the 38th parallel north.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish vanguard {{was driven}} {{off by the}} English at the first charge, but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega, from Francisco Arias de Bobadilla's and Juan del Ãguila's tercios, formed the {{defenders}} into squadron formation and kept the way open for the wagons. As the carters fled {{at the beginning of}} the fight, the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought the wagons towards Zutphen. Stanley's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron, but they were repelled at the push of pike. As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire, he ordered a wagon to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers. The English cavalry, in the meantime, charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks. Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks, Essex's men could not penetrate further. Twice more the English charged upon the squadron, but they were as well repelled.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to <b>be</b> <b>loaded.</b> Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{armament}} of the KongÅ class {{consisted of}} eight 45-calibre 14-inch guns, mounted in four superfiring twin-gun turrets. The turrets had an elevation capability of 5/+20 degrees except in KongÅ whose turrets had a maximum elevation capability of +25 degrees. The shells could <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> at any angle and the guns had a firing cycle of 30â40 seconds. These guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first {{reconstruction of the}} class during the 1920s, the elevation of the main guns was increased {{to a maximum of}} +33 degrees. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E
