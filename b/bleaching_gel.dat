40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{hypothesis}} {{that there was no}} difference in effect of 10 % and 15 % tooth bleaching agents on color stability of materials used for provisional fixed dental prosthesis. Methodology: Fifteen samples from two materials used for provisional fixed dental prosthesis: methacrylate-based and composite-based materials and 15 preformed polycarbonate crowns soaked in <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> or distilled water. Spectrophotometer recorded color of specimens at baseline, after 3, 7, and 14 days. Data were statistically analyzed using two-factor ANOVA test to compare the color stability of tested materials. Results: Methyl-based provisional material exhibited statistically higher color change when exposed to 10 % and 15 % <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> (delta EFNx 01 : 9. 0 and 11. 1, respectively) as compared to distilled water (delta EFNx 01 : 2. 9). Delta EFNx 01 of composite-based material specimens exposed to distilled water was statistically higher (6. 3) than specimens exposed to 10 % and 15 % <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> (1. 5 and 1. 1, respectively). Polycarbonate crowns showed a statistically lower color change when exposed to 15 % (0. 9) than to 10 % <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> (5. 1) or distilled water (5. 5).

40|$|AIM The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the Influence of simulated pulpal pressure on efficacy of <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS Cylindrical enamel-dentin specimens from bovine teeth (3 mm diameter, enamel and dentin layer each 1 mm thick) were divided into 4 groups, according to the bleaching treatment: negative control (non-bleached), bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide (CP), bleached with 7. 5 % hydrogen peroxide (HP) and bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide. Ten percent CP gel was applied for 8 h/day and 7. 5 % HP for 1 h/day, during 14 days. For 35 % HP treatment, two sessions of 45 minutes each were employed. In intermediate periods specimens were stored in artificial saliva. Experimental groups (n = 19) were subdivided according to the simulation of pulpal pressure (25 mm Hg) during bleaching treatment. Initial color measurement and after bleaching treatment were assessed by spectrophotometry, using CIE L*a*b* system. The data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Dunnett's post-hoc tests (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION It was concluded that all <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels</b> showed <b>bleaching</b> efficacy compared to non-bleached group and that the simulated pulpal pressure did not Influence the bleaching outcomes of the tested gels. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Although numerous in vitro studies investigating the efficacy of bleaching agents have been performed, they do not properly simulate the pulpal pressure. In order to make these studies closer to clinical conditions, it is important to reproduce these conditions in laboratory, so the results can be more reliable.

However, these light sources can cause {{an increase in the}} pulp temperature. Objective The {{purpose of the present study}} was to measure the increase in intrapulpal temperature induced by different light-activated bleaching procedures with and without the use of a <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel.</b> Material and Methods A human maxillary central incisor was sectioned 2 mm below the cementoenamel junction. A K-type thermocouple probe was introduced into the pulp chamber. A 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> was applied to the vestibular tooth surface. The light units used were a conventional halogen, a hybrid light (only LED and LED/Laser), a high intensity LED, and a green LED light. Temperature increase values were compared by two-way ANOVA and Tukey´s tests (p< 0. 05). Results There were statistically significant differences in temperature increases between the different light sources used and between the same light sources with and without the use of a <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel.</b> The presence of a <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> generated an increase in intra-pulpal temperature in groups activated with halogen light, hybrid light, and high intensity LED. Compared to the other light sources, the conventional halogen lamp applied over the <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> induced a signiﬁcant increase in temperature (3. 83 ± 0. 41 °C). The green LED unit with and without gel application did not produce any significant intrapulpal temperature variations. Conclusion In the present study, the conventional halogen lamp caused the highest increase in intrapulpal temperature, and the green LED caused the least. There was an increase in temperature with all lights tested and the maximum temperature remained below the critical level (5. 5 °C).

25|$|Many toothpastes make {{whitening}} claims. Some {{of these}} toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels.</b> The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains.

Subsequently, the specimens were stored for 16 h daily in a remineralizing solution (pH 7. 0; 14 d), while for the remaining time (8 h) various <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels</b> were applied: (1) no treatment (control), (2) Opalescence regular (O; Ultradent), (3) Opalescence PF (O-PF), (4) Nite White ACP (NW-ACP; Discus Dental) and (5) Nite White ACPF (NW-ACPF). Following, half of the bleached parts were nail-varnished and stored for another 3 -weeks period in a remineralizing solution. Differences in mineral losses and lesion depths before and after treatment/remineralization period were evaluated from microradiographs. Additionally, the mineral loss was calculated in the surface layer up {{to a depth of}} 18 µm of the lesion.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the micro leakage of composite restoration by using self etch and total etch (fifth, sixth and seventh generation) of adhesive agents after using 35 % carbamide peroxide gel. Methods and Materials: After preparation of CLV cavity in the buccal and lingual surface of 30 extracted bovine teeth, the teeth were divided to six groups. (n = 5) Then one of the adhesive agents, Single bond (self etch, groups 1 and 4), prompt L- POP (total etch, groups 2 and 5), G Bond, (Self etch Group 3 and 6) were used in the cavity and then restored with Z 100 composite. Then groups 4, 5 and 6 were exposed to 35 % carbamide peroxide gel three times for 30 minutes each time. The specimens were termocycled in 5 ± 2 ◦C and 55 ± 2 ◦C c for 500 times and stored in basic fusing for 24 hours. Then the teeth were sectioned and dye penetration was evaluated by Stereomicroscope (× 40). The results were analyzed by suing kraskal- wallis and Man- whithny tests (α < 0. 05).

However, in both materials the differences in surface roughness were significant before and after bleaching procedures (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: Based on {{the results of the present}} study it was concluded that 15 % carbamide peroxide does not induce clinically detectable color changes in composite resin and giomer despite an increase in surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} spheres as biomaterials {{have been}} attracting attention in recent years. Calcium phosphate occurs naturally in bone, and a hollow structure could be advantageous for drug loading and release. The {{combination of a}} calcium phosphate chemistry and a spherical-hollow structure could be an optimal strategy for specific biomaterial applications, e. g., certain dental and drug-delivery applications. The focus of this thesis is on the synthesis, formation mechanism and applications of hollow, spherical calcium phosphate particles. First, the thesis describes two methods for the synthesis of calcium phosphate (CaP) spherical particles. The first method involves synthesis of hollow calcium phosphate spherical particles via a supersaturated buffer solution based on a previous study. It was utilised to prepare spheres for applications in drug delivery and dentistry. The second method was developed to explain the mechanism of formation of hollow calcium phosphate spheres. It aimed at revealing the particular function of magnesium {{in the formation of}} spherical particles. With the use of this modified method, it could be concluded that the only ions active in the formation of CaP spherical particles are calcium ions, phosphate ions and magnesium ions. Compared with the thermodynamics of micellisation, a new model, called three ions virtual micelle effect, was developed to explain the mechanism of the Mg function. Following this mechanism, a series of spherical particles of other compositions were explored. These spherical particles included strontium phosphate, barium phosphate, calcium fluoride, strontium fluoride and barium fluoride. In this thesis, CaP spheres were studied for the controlled delivery of active ingredients and as active agent for tooth remineralisation. The first investigated application was to control the release of vancomycin from Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cement via strontium-doped CaP spheres (SCPS). The results showed that incorporation of CaP spheres into PMMA could enhance antibiotic release while maintaining the mechanical strength. The second application was to control hydrogen peroxide (HP) release from two <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel,</b> in which CP-loaded CaP spheres were the active ingredient. One gel with low HP concentration was developed as an at-home <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel,</b> and one with high HP concentration was developed as an in-office <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel.</b> The results showed that CaP spheres would give a controlled release of peroxide and thus have a potential to increase the efficacy of the bleaching. The third application was to investigate the potential for an anti-sensitivity effect of the spheres, as active agents in toothpaste. We studied the tooth tubules occlusion and the remineralisation effect of CaP spheres. After 7 days of application, the open dentin tubules and surface were fully covered by a newly formed apatite layer, demonstrating the remineralisation potential of the spheres...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} 16 % carbamide peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> on surface micromorphology and roughness of enamel and root dentin of uremic patients receiving hemodialysis using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Methods: A total of 20 sound molars were collected from healthy individuals (n= 10) and uremic patients (n= 10). The roots were separated from their crowns at the cemento-enamel junction. Dental slabs (3 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm) {{were obtained from the}} buccal surface for enamel slabs and the cervical third of the root surface for dentin slabs. Dental slabs were then flattened and serially polished up to # 2500 -grit roughness using silicon carbide abrasive papers. Half of the slabs obtained from healthy individuals and uremic patients were stored in artificial saliva and left without bleaching for control and comparison. The remaining half was subjected to a bleaching treatment using 16 % carbamide peroxide gel (Polanight, SDI Limited) 8 h/day for 14 days and stored in artificial saliva until AFM analysis was performed. Statistical analysis of the roughness average (Ra) results was performed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparisons test. Results: The micromorphological observation of bleached, healthy enamel showed exaggerated prism irregularities more than non-bleached specimens, and this observation was less pronounced in bleached uremic enamel specimens with the lowest Ra. Bleached healthy dentin specimens showed protruded peritubular dentin and eroded intertubular dentin with the highest Ra compared to bleached uremic dentin. Conclusions: The negative effects of the <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> on uremic tooth substrates are less dramatic and non-destructive compared to healthy substrates because uremia confers different micromorphological surface changes.

40|$|ABSTRACT Dental materials, in general, {{are tested}} in {{different}} animal models {{prior to their}} clinical use in humans, except for bleaching agents. Objectives To evaluate an experimental rat model for comparative studies of bleaching agents by investigating the influence of different concentrations and application times of H 2 O 2 gel in the pulp tissue during in-office bleaching of rats’ vital teeth. Material and methods The right and left maxillary molars of 50 Wistar rats were bleached with 20 % and 35 % H 2 O 2 gels, respectively, for 5, 10, 15, 30, or 45 min (n= 10 rats/group). Ten animals (control) were untreated. The rats were killed after 2 or 30 days, and the maxillae were examined by light microscopy. Inflammation was evaluated by histomorphometric analysis with inflammatory cell counting in the coronal and radicular thirds of the pulp. The counting of fibroblasts was also performed. Scores were attributed to the odontoblastic layer and to vascular changes. The tertiary dentin area and the pulp chamber central area were histomorphometrically measured. Data were compared by the analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test (p< 0. 05). Results After 2 days, the amount of inflammatory cells increased in the occlusal third of the coronal pulp until the time of 15 min for both concentrations of <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels.</b> In 30 and 45 min groups of each concentration, the number of inflammatory cells decreased along {{with the appearance of}} necrotic areas. After 30 days, a reduction in the pulp chamber central area and an enlargement of tertiary dentin area were observed without the detection of inflammation areas. Conclusion The rat model of extra coronal bleaching showed to be adequate for bleaching protocols studies, as it was possible to observe alterations in the pulp tissues and in the tooth structure caused by different concentrations and periods of application of bleaching agents...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{assessed}} {{the changes in}} surface roughness and microhardness of three esthetic restorative materials after bleaching with 10 %, 20 % and 35 % carbamide peroxide (CP). MethodsStandardized cylindrical specimens (n= 210) of 3 esthetic materials (nano composite resin (NC), resin modified glass ionomer (GI), feldspathic porcelain (FP) were fabricated (n= 70). They were divided into 3 groups (n= 20) and a control group (n= 10). Each group was bleached with different concentrations of CP. The specimens of group 1 and 2 (10 % CP and 20 % CP) were immersed in the <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels</b> for 6 h daily, while group 3 (35 % CP) was immersed for 30 min weekly. The control group was stored in artificial saliva. After 21 days, the morphological changes of the specimens were investigated with surface texture analyzer, while the hardness was assessed by performing superficial microhardness analysis. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, and Scheffe test at α= 0. 05. ResultsNo significant differences in roughness average (Ra) were recorded among the control group and 10 % CP bleached groups of all tested restorative materials (NC (p= 0. 1495), GI (p= 0. 0761), FP (p= 0. 2848)). However, {{there were significant differences}} in Ra among the control group, 20 % CP, and 35 % CP (p< 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} the microhardness of feldspathic porcelain (10 % (p= 0. 0786), 20 % (p= 0. 1041), and 35 % (p= 0. 2066). While nano composite resin and resin modified glass ionomer specimens were significantly affected by concentration of 20 % and 35 % CP (p< 0. 05). ConclusionThe effect of bleaching depends on the concentration of CP. The higher surface roughness was produced by 35 % CP. Bleaching with different concentrations did not reduce the microhardness of the feldspathic porcelain. However, microhardness of nano composite resin and resin modified glass ionomer specimens was affected by 20 % CP and 35 % CP...|$|R

40|$|O clareamento dental é um procedimento que está diretamente relacionado à estética dental e cabe ao profissional de odontologia conhecer e dominar os diferentes materiais, métodos de ativação e técnicas de clareamento. Este estudo ¨In Vitro¨ avaliou comparativamente o aumento de temperatura intra-câmara pulpar durante o clareamento em consultório ativado com diferentes fontes de luz com e sem gel clareador. Foi selecionado 1 incisivo central {{superior}} humano, seccionado na porção radicular 3 mm abaixo da junção cemento-esmalte. O canal radicular foi alargado para permitir a introdução do sensor do termômetro dentro da câmara pulpar. A câmara pulpar foi preenchida com uma pasta térmica (C. N. P. J. 52. 891. 405 / 0001 - 60, Implastec Electroquímica, Votorantim, SP), a fim de permitir a transferência de calor das paredes dentárias para o sensor de um termômetro digital com termopar tipo K (MT- 401 A) durante o clareamento. A porção radicular do dente foi submersa em água a 37 º C elevando a câmara pulpar a mesma temperatura. Um agente clareador fotossensível à base de peróxido de hidrogênio a 35 % (Lase Peroxide DMC Equipamentos) foi utilizado. Para a ativação do gel foram empregados quatro aparelhos com diferentes fontes de luz: luz halógena (Spectrum Dentsply); luz híbrida à base de LED e Laser Diodo (Ultra Blue IV DMC Equipamentos); LED (Smart Lite PS Dentsply) e LED verde (D Light Green - Kondortech). As ativações foram feitas de acordo com as especificações do fabricante. com seis aplicações para cada grupo. Os resultados foram submetidos a ANOVA a dois critérios e teste de Tukey (p 0, 05). Os grupos estudados e as medias do aumento da temperatura foram: D - Light Green sem gel (37 ºC) A, D - Light Green com gel (37, 17 ºC) A, Smart Lite sem gel (39, 17 ºC) C, Smart Lite com gel (40 ºC) D, Ultra Blue IV sem laser sem gel (38 ºC) B, Ultra Blue IV sem {{laser com}} gel (39, 17 ºC) C, Ultra Blue IV com laser sem gel (38, 17 ºC) B, Ultra Blue IV com laser com gel (39, 33 ºC) C, Spectrum sem gel (39, 17 ºC) C e Spectrum com gel (40, 83 ºC) E. Todas as lâmpadas apresentaram aumento da temperatura intracâmara pulpar, com exceção do D - Green Light, sem atingir a temperatura crítica de 5, 5 ºC. A fonte de luz halógena com gel apresentou o maior aumento de temperatura. The {{purpose of this}} In Vitro study was to measure the intrapulpal temperature rise induced by various light sources and a <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel.</b> The root portion of an intact human maxillary central incisor was sectioned with a diamond disk 3 mm below the cement enamel junction. The apical foramen of the root was enlarged and remaining pulp tissue was removed. The empty pulp chamber {{was filled with a}} heat sink compound and a thin K-type thermocouple was introduced into the pulp chamber. The root surface of the tooth was partially submerged in a water bath during the testing procedure at 37 °C elevating the pulp chamber at the same temperature. A 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> (Lase Peroxide - DMC Equipamentos) containing heat enhanced colorants was applied to the vestibular tooth surface. Light units used were a conventional tungsten quartz halogen (Spectrum Dentsply), a LED/Laser device (Ultra Blue IV DMC Equipamentos), a high intensity LED (Smart Lite PS Dentsply) and a green LED light (D Light Green - Kondortech). A pilot study and a statistical analysis were made to determine the number of application needed. Six applications were made for each system and gel combination. Differences between the starting temperature and final temperature reading were taken and the calculated temperature changes were averaged to determine the mean value in temperature rise. Temperature rise values were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a preset alfa of 0. 05. Temperature rise varied significantly {{depending on the type of}} light used and in presence or absent of <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel.</b> The conventional tungsten quartz halogen lamp with <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> induced significantly higher temperature increases than any other curing unit (3, 83 °C). The green light-emitting diode unit without gel produced no temperature changes. Almost as a rule, the presence of <b>bleaching</b> <b>gel</b> resulted in a significant intrapulpal temperature increase (approximately 1 ºC) over that reached using no gel. However, light bleaching systems thus increase intrapulpal temperature, all the procedures used in this study were below the critical level of 5, 5 ºC...|$|E

40|$|Em virtude da existência de grande quantidade de géis, fontes de luz e protocolos de irradiação disponíveis para o clareamento dental, a {{literatura}} vigente não é ainda suficientemente completa a ponto de esclarecer se existem melhores associações de protocolo e gel para o tratamento. Diante disso, esse estudo teve como objetivos: a) verificar se os protocolos de irradiação testados para cada fonte de luz são capazes de elevar o potencial clareador de cada gel; b) verificar se há um melhor gel clareador para cada protocolo de irradiação. Espécimes dentais bovinos foram randomicamente alocados em nove tratamentos experimentais (n= 14), que incluíram três géis: Lase Peroxide Sensy (LPS), White Gold Office (WGO) e Placebo (PL); duas fontes de luz: Whitening Lase Light Plus (WLLP), Thera Lase Surgery (TLS) e a ausência de irradiação como controle. A cor dos espécimes foi aferida pelo espectrofotômetro intra-oral VITA Easyshade Compact, por meio do sistema CIE-L*a*b*, em dois momentos experimentais: antes e após sete dias dos tratamentos. Com base nos valores das coordenadas da cor L*, a* e b*, foram calculados os valores de variação: L*, a*, b*, C* e E*. A variável E* foi utilizada para verificar se houve variação de cor nos espécimes após os tratamentos. Os valores de variação L*, a*, b* e C* foram utilizados para investigar como ocorreu a variação de cor obtida. O gel placebo promoveu os mesmos valores de E*, com ou sem fontes de luz, sempre abaixo do considerado perceptível visualmente. Os géis clareadores LPS e WGO promoveram valores de E* superiores aos gerados pelo gel placebo (p< 0, 05), sempre acima do considerado perceptível visualmente. Para o gel LPS, os valores de E* promovidos com o clareamento foram os mesmos, independentemente da utilização de fontes de luz. Para o gel WGO, o valor de E* alcançado com a fonte de luz WLLP foi superior ao obtido com a fonte de luz TLS (p< 0, 001) e sem irradiação (p< 0, 001). Para a fonte de luz WLLP, não foi encontrada diferença significante entre os valores de E* obtidos com o gel LPS e o gel WGO. Para a fonte de luz TLS, o valor de E* obtido com o gel LPS foi superior ao obtido com o gel WGO (p< 0, 001). Sem luz, o valor de E* promovido pelo gel LPS foi superior ao alcançado com o gel WGO (p= 0, 002). Os valores de L* e b* foram os determinantes das variações de cor obtidas após os tratamentos (p< 0, 001). Pôde-se concluir que nenhum protocolo de irradiação foi capaz de elevar a capacidade clareadora do gel LPS. O gel WGO teve a sua eficácia aumentada quando utilizado o protocolo de irradiação da fonte de luz WLLP. Com o protocolo de irradiação da fonte luminosa WLLP, os dois géis clareadores em teste obtiveram a mesma capacidade clareadora. Com o protocolo de irradiação da fonte de luz TLS e sem o uso de fontes de luz, o gel LPS obteve melhor resultado clareador do que o gel WGO. The {{current literature}} is not sufficiently complete as to clarify {{whether there are}} better associations of gel and protocol to the tooth whitening, because {{of the existence of}} large amounts of gels, light sources and irradiation protocols available for the treatment. Thus, this study aimed to: a) verify whether the protocols of irradiation tested for each light source are able to raise the whitening potential of each gel; b) verify whether there is a better whitening gel for each protocol of irradiation. Bovine tooth specimens were randomly allocated to nine treatments (n= 14), which included three gels: Lase Peroxide Sensy (LPS), White Gold Office (WGO) and Placebo (PL), two light sources: Whitening Lase Light Plus (WLLP) Thera Lase Surgery (TLS) and the absence of irradiation as a control. The color of the specimens was measured by an intraoral spectrophotometer, VITA Easyshade Compact, according to the CIE L*a*b* system, in two experimental times: before and after seven days of the treatments. From the L*, a* and b* color coordinates, the values of the changes L*, a*, b*, C* and E* were calculated. E* was used to determine whether there was variation in color of the specimens after the treatments. The variables L*, a*, b* and C* were used to investigate how the change in color was obtained. The placebo gel promoted the same values of E*, with or without light sources, always below the visually perceptible. The LPS and WGO <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels</b> promoted E* values greater than those generated by the placebo gel (p< 0. 05), always above the considered visually perceptible. To the LPS gel, E* values promoted with bleaching were the same regardless of the use of light sources. To the WGO gel, the achieved values of E* with WLLP light source was superior to that obtained with the TLS light source (p< 0. 001) and without irradiation (p< 0. 001). For the WLLP light source, it was not found significant difference between the E* values obtained with the LPS and WGO gels. For the TLS light source, the obtained E* value with the LPS gel was greater than with the WGO gel (p< 0. 001). Without irradiation, the E* value promoted by LPS gel was higher than that achieved with the WGO gel (p= 0. 002). The L* and b* values were the determinants of color variations obtained after the treatments (p< 0, 001). It was concluded that no protocol of irradiation was able to increase the capacity of the whitening gel LPS. The WGO gel had its effectiveness increased when the WLLP protocol of the irradiation was used. With the WLLP protocol irradiation, the two <b>bleaching</b> <b>gels</b> obtained the same bleaching ability. According to the protocol of irradiation of the TLS light source and without the use of irradiation, LPS <b>gel</b> had better <b>bleaching</b> results than the WGO gel...|$|R
