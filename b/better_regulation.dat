500|$|FERC and USACE {{regulated}} releases {{downstream from}} the dam {{have been the}} center of controversy in recent years. Since the dam is a multi-purpose project, there are conflicting interests between flood control, environmental conservation, recreation and hydroelectric power production. The USACE may request minimal releases to prevent flooding in areas downstream and in hot mid-summer periods, releases can be minimal. This reduces dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the river downstream. Such reductions resulted {{in the death of}} at least 5,000 fish downstream in July 2007. Significant releases from the dam have drawn opposition from people such as Oklahoma State Representative Doug Cox. He argues that the large releases effect the state's economy as an off-road recreational rock park is flooded downstream. [...] Inconsistent releases are blamed for the overall problem and a <b>better</b> <b>regulation</b> of releases has been proposed while the GRDA is contemplating the installation of aeration devices and conducting studies along with other measures.

40|$|E-crimes {{continue}} to generate grave {{challenges to the}} ICT regulatory agenda. Because e-crimes involve a wrongful appropriation of information online, it is enquired whether information is property which is capable of being stolen. This then requires an investigation {{to be made of}} the law of property. The basis for this scrutiny is to establish if information is property for purposes of the law. Following a study of the Roman-Dutch law approach to property, it is argued that the emergence of an information society makes real rights in information possible. This is the position because information is one of the indispensable assets of an information society. Given the fact that information can be the object of property, its position in the law of theft is investigated. This study is followed by an examination of the conventional risks that ICTs generate. For example, a risk exists that ICTs may be used as the object of e-crimes. Furthermore, there is a risk that ICTs may become a tool in order to appropriate information unlawfully. Accordingly, the scale and impact of e-crimes is more than those of the offline crimes, for example theft or fraud. The severe challenges that ICTs pose to an information society are likely to continue if clarity is not sought regarding: whether ICTs can be regulated or not, if ICTs can be regulated, how should an ICT regulatory framework be structured? A study of the law and regulation for regulatory purposes reveals that ICTs are spheres where regulations apply or should apply. However, <b>better</b> <b>regulations</b> are appropriate in dealing with the dynamics of these technologies. Smart-regulations, meta-regulations or reflexive regulations, self-regulations and co-regulations are concepts that support <b>better</b> <b>regulations.</b> <b>Better</b> <b>regulations</b> enjoin the regulatory industries, for example the state, businesses and computer users to be involved in establishing ICT regulations. These ICT regulations should specifically be in keeping with the existing e-authentication measures. Furthermore, the codes-based theory, the Danger or Artificial Immune Systems (the AIS) theory, the Systems theory and the Good Regulator Theorem ought to inform ICT regulations. The basis for all this should be to establish a holistic approach to e-authentication. This approach must conform to the Precautionary Approach to E-Authentication or PAEA. PAEA accepts the importance of legal rules in the ICT regulatory agenda. However, it argues that flexible regulations could provide a suitable framework within which ICTs and the ICT risks are controlled. In addition, PAEA submit that a state should not be the single role-player in ICT regulations. Social norms, the market and nature or architecture of the technology to be regulated are also fundamental to the ICT regulatory agenda. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the development of self-regulation across preschool and early childhood, with an emphasis on identifying basic developmental processes, implications for adjustment, and contextual influences. Study 1 utilized a path analytic framework to assess longitudinal transactional relations between emotion and behavior regulation. Study 2 utilized a latent change analytic framework to assess the development of self-regulation and the influence of context. The use of these two complementary paradigms sought to clarify individual patterns of growth and stability, and to elucidate the mechanism behind potential cross domain effects. Data were drawn from a diverse sample of 250 children who completed annual observational assessments of regulation during laboratory tasks at ages four, five, and six. Additional measures included parent report of adversity exposure, teacher report of social competence, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, and laboratory-measured academic achievement. Study 1 found modest stability of regulation across early childhood, and bidirectional prospective relations between emotion and behavior <b>regulation.</b> <b>Better</b> behavior <b>regulation</b> at age four predicted <b>better</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> at age six, while <b>better</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> at age five predicted <b>better</b> behavior <b>regulation</b> at age six. Each cross-domain longitudinal relation controlled for the stability of prior within-domain regulation and concurrent cross-domain relations. Behavior regulation evidenced direct relations with adjustment in multiple domains, with indirect effects of emotion regulation emerging through its effect on behavior regulation. Study 2 found that emotion and behavior regulation evidenced different patterns of growth. Emotion regulation improved from age four to five, and remained relatively constant from age five to six. Furthermore, higher levels of cumulative adversity predicted a decrease in the slope of emotion regulation trajectories, such that children who experienced more adversity improved less in emotion regulation over time. There was no significant effect of adversity on initial levels of regulation. Although behavior regulation appeared to increase in a linear fashion, a latent change model could not be fit successfully, which precluded assessing the effect of adversity on behavior regulation, or interrelations between regulatory trajectories. Implications are for the development of context-sensitive interventions and increased specification of key domains of self-regulation in investigations...|$|R
