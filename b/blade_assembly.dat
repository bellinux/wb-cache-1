The object of this thesis is to investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, the free and forced vibrations of wind turbine tower assemblies, using model order reduction techniques. This approach reduces the number of degrees-of- freedom of the system rendering the dynamic analysis more computationally efficient. First, discrete, distributed parameter and finite element models are proposed in order to obtain the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the individual components of the wind turbine tower, as well as a coupled tower and <b>blades</b> <b>assembly.</b> Next, the forced vibration response of all individual and coupled assemblies is modelled in the time domain with both classical and non-classical damping.

In this study, the global non-rotating mode shapes of flexible <b>bladed</b> disc–shaft <b>assemblies</b> are used in a modal analysis method for calculating the dynamic characteristics (frequencies and mode shapes) of the corresponding rotating system. The non-rotating mode shapes are computed using a finite element cyclic symmetry approach. Rotational effects, such as centrifugal stiffening and gyroscopic effects, are accounted for.

Most modern blenders offer {{a number of possible}} speeds. Low-powered blenders require the addition of some liquid to operate correctly. In these blenders, the liquid helps move the solids around the jar, bringing them in contact with the blades. The blades create a whirlpool effect which moves solids from top to bottom, ensuring even contact with the blade. This creates a homogeneous mixture. High-powered blenders are capable of milling grains and crushing ice without such assistance.|$|E
50|$|A blender {{consists}} of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the <b>blade</b> <b>assembly.</b> Usually, a small rubber washer provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the <b>blade</b> <b>assembly</b> {{in contact with the}} material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.|$|E

For a slightly longer (up to a minute) delay, a dashpot is used. A dashpot is a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly; both air-filled and oil-filled dashpots are used. The time period can be varied by increasing or decreasing the flow rate. For longer time periods, a mechanical clockwork timer is installed.
