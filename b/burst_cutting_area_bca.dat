The user then removes the disc (after installing small modifications to prevent the system from detecting the drive being opened) and replaces it with another disc which can then be started. The software also allows other homebrew software to be run from a memory card or USB flash drive.|$|R

The prediction method of thermal deformation based on frequency domain is constructed from transfer function between specified surface temperatures and the relative displacement in <b>cutting</b> <b>area.</b> The relative displacement in <b>cutting</b> <b>area</b> is predicted using two specified surface temperatures near heat source in machine tool model. As a result, the method can be predicted with enough certainty at what rate the temperature changes the most rapidly on machine's startup transient behavior.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{understand}} {{the prevalence of}} polyneuropathy and correlations among the clinical manifestations, electrophysiological findings, and degree of exposure to carbon disulphide (CS 2) in workers {{who were exposed to}} variable concentrations of CS 2 in a viscose rayon factory. METHODS [...] All the 163 workers received a detailed physical and neurological evaluation. Fixed point air samples were analysed for CS 2. Nerve conduction velocity was studied in 26 workers with symptoms similar to neuropathy. RESULTS [...] Nine workers (53 %) with overt polyneuropathy from the fibre cutting department and 19 workers (13 %) with oligosymptoms similar to polyneuropathy from various jobs were noted. The fixed point air concentrations of CS 2 were 150 - 300 ppm in the <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> and 15 to 100 ppm in the spinning areas. The estimated eight hour time weighted averages in the fibre <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> were 40 - 67 ppm. The occurrence of polyneuropathy was generally correlated with the degree of exposure to CS 2. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) were significantly different in the overt polyneuropathy and subclinical polyneuropathy groups from the normal controls. The sensitive indicators for CS 2 polyneuropathy were distal latency, motor NCV, and amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials in sensory NCVs. CONCLUSION [...] The outbreak of polyneuropathy was attributed to higher concentrations of CS 2 in fibre <b>cutting</b> <b>areas.</b> Even in other jobs with relatively lower concentrations of CS 2, the hazard of subclinical polyneuropathy cannot be overlooked...|$|R
