This publication describes a reproducible and sensitive protocol for the preparation and analysis of plant N-glycans, based on a combination of the in-gel release method and N-glycan analysis on a multicapillary DNA sequencer.

50|$|Outgassing from {{surfaces}} is a subtler problem. At {{extremely low}} pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed {{on the walls}} than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber {{is more important than}} its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of <b>background</b> <b>contamination.</b> Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400 °C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using liquid nitrogen to reduce outgassing further.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{aspect of}} our sensor system serves two distinct purposes. First, {{it is used to}} clean and electrochemically characterize the surface of the gold coated cantilever. Secondly, it is used to apply a controlled, time dependent potential to the cantilever to induce repetitive surface stress changes. This first point is very important, as surface stress and surface stress changes are driven by surface charge density, which {{is a function of the}} cleanliness of a system [9]. Recalling that a clean metallic surface typically takes about 1 microsecond to be contaminated in air by absorbable organic molecules – hence the need for ultra high vacuum conditions (UHV) to investigate surface phenomena. Electrochemistry allows a systematic cleaning and characterization of surfaces in solution. Note that compared to the concentration of rest gas (‘contaminations’) in UHV, solutions are very seldom as pure – clean solution to <b>background</b> <b>contaminations</b> would need to be at a level of 1 part in 1013 to achieve similar lifetimes of clean surfaces in solution as in UHV.|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{animal studies}} are needed to {{accomplish}} measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for medical diagnostics. In order to analyze the time course of VOCs, it is necessary to ventilate these animals. Therefore, a total of 10 male Sprague–Dawley rats were anaesthetized and ventilated with synthetic air via tracheotomy for 24 [*]h. An ion mobility spectrometry coupled to multi-capillary columns (MCC–IMS) was used to analyze the expired air. To identify <b>background</b> <b>contaminations</b> produced by the respirator itself, six comparative measurements were conducted with ventilators only. Overall, a number of 37 peaks could be detected within the positive mode. According to the ratio peak intensity rat/ peak intensity ventilator blank, 22 peaks with a ratio > 1. 5 were defined as expired VOCs, 12 peaks with a ratio between 0. 5 and 1. 5 as unaffected VOCs, and three peaks with a ratio < 0. 5 as resorbed VOCs. The peak intensity of 12 expired VOCs changed significantly during the 24 [*]h measurement. These results represent the basis for future intervention studies.
