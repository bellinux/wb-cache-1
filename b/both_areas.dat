The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory. The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in <b>both</b> <b>areas</b> profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E

5|$|Reportedly, Tiberius once {{ran into}} Vipsania again, and {{proceeded}} to follow her home crying and begging forgiveness; soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again.

5|$|As {{the week}} goes on, {{the people in}} the cabin are running out of food, while Satoru is {{subjected}} to multiple attempts on his life by an unknown assailant.

It is revealed that the Yuni in the cabin is from the year 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} {{can be used}} to allow researchers to make inferences about the diet of the species being studied. Two isotope analyses of bone collagen extracted from the remains of Late Pleistocene wolves found in Beringia and Belgium indicate that wolves from <b>both</b> <b>areas</b> preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna, which became rare {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene 12,000 years ago. The Beringian wolf preyed most often on horse and steppe bison. In the period leading up to the Last Glacial Maximum (50,000YBP–23,000YBP), they also ate woodland muskox, and after this time they also ate mammoth. The analysis supports the conclusion that these wolves were capable of killing and dismembering large prey.|$|E

5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. <b>Both</b> <b>areas</b> support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|An early Italian humanist {{who came}} to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. This was {{supported}} by temporarily strengthened monarchies in <b>both</b> <b>areas,</b> {{as well as by}} newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellon dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.|$|E

Nearby, the storm nearly destroyed two isolated villages, Punta Abreojos village and Laguna San Ignacio. <b>Both</b> <b>areas</b> got hit by Jimena at its first landfall. Although in Bahia Asuncion damages was minor, the villages of Abreojos and San Ignacio Lagoon were badly damaged. Seventy percent of the electric network form Santa Rosalía to Ciuadad Constitución was damaged due to power outages. In both of the towns, the Mexican Red Cross branches received some damage. The roads from San José del Cabo to Tijuana was affected because any nearby creeks overflowed their banks. The airports in Los Cabos, La Paz and Loreto and ports were briefly closed, but were later re-opened after the storm passed since the airports received only minimal damage.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of The Carolinas, the former {{tropical}} storm became a large and powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining peak winds of 90mph (140km/h) along with a pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg), measured by the USS Patoka. Gale force winds extended to at least New Jersey, where winds of 70mph (110km/h) were recorded. Throughout December2, the storm gradually slowed as it tracked roughly parallel to the East Coast. Later that day, the system moved onshore again, this time between Wilmington and Cape Hatteras, with winds equivalent to a minimal hurricane. A strong area of high pressure located over the Canadian Maritimes caused the system to turn towards the east-southeast. Over the following few days, the storm gradually weakened as it moved away from North Carolina. By December5, the storm was no longer identifiable and is presumed to have dissipated offshore. However, a monthly weather review published in 1925 that documented the system indicated that the cyclone continued towards the east, eventually impacting Bermuda and the Azores. Later analysis in 2009 concluded that a separate extratropical low, which formed near {{the remnants of the}} storm, was responsible for inclement weather in <b>both</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E
