The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E

I did {{grow up in a}} small town, I wanted to get out, I felt like there was something... not <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but something different for me. I didn't feel like I fit in at school. Whether you are a DJ, or if you work with computers, or if you're a teacher, everyone has that point where they feel, 'I'm bored and this isn't what I wanted to do with my life.' ...|$|E

500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E

But Disney {{expressed}} interest, with Lucas saying [...] "It's <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to get out {{at the beginning of a}} new thing and I can just remove myself. The time is more important to me than the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams has {{admitted}} being very shy and {{was diagnosed with}} social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidance disorder with which he struggled to cope during his football career. Williams was treated with therapy and medication. Williams was briefly {{a spokesperson for the}} drug Paxil as treatment. He worked with the drug company GlaxoSmithKline to educate the public about the disorder. Williams later quit using Paxil and said that cannabis was a much better form of treatment. In an interview with ESPN, Williams stated, [...] "marijuana is 10 times <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> than Paxil." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] she {{answered}} softly. [...] "It would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> you, <b>better,</b> perhaps, <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{if you would}} do as I ask--if you would go away and forget! But if you will not do that, {{there is no reason}} why you should not come to the château. A carriage will arrive for you at seven o'clock." ...|$|R

2500|$|I did batik at first, {{and then}} after doing that I learned {{more and more and}} then I changed over to {{painting}} for good...Then it was canvas. I gave up on...fabric to avoid all the boiling to get the wax out. I got a bit lazy – I gave it up because it was too much hard work. I finally got sick of it ... I didn't want to continue with the hard work batik required – boiling the fabric over and over, lighting fires, and using up all the soap powder, over and over. That's why I gave up batik and changed over to canvas – it was easier. My eyesight deteriorated as I got older, and because of that I gave up batik on silk – it was <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to just paint.|$|E
2500|$|Grant {{was born}} in Edinburgh, {{and raised in the}} city's Morningside district. His Musselburgh-born father James managed the pop band Marmalade before {{becoming}} an accountant. His mother Susan worked for the University of Edinburgh. He attended the Edinburgh Academy before joining Barnard Castle School as a boarding pupil. Grant explained that [...] "My parents thought it would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be away from home. They have good friends who live not far from Barnard Castle and their two sons were there. So they knew the school and said it was good for rugby and I was mad on rugby." [...] Whilst at Barnard Castle he represented Scottish rugby union at U18 and U19 level, although his rugby career was cut short by a shoulder injury. Grant lists his early fashion influences as Barbour, Burberry, Hunter, Lyle & Scott and Pringle.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} themes was the value and importance which the interviewees placed on their jobs. Working overtime seemed to be normal for the interviewees [...] many spoke of waking up early so they could arrive at work up to 90 minutes before it officially began. Although they were suffering from extreme physical symptoms from inhaling sarin, most of the interviewees continued on their way to work, only reporting to the hospital for treatment when unable to carry out their responsibilities at work, or under the insistence of a colleague or superior. Several of the interviewees returned to work quite soon after the attacks, despite not being fully recovered. One salesman said, [...] "Honestly, it would have been <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to take some time off with sick pay, but the company wasn't that generous. It was nine to five, plus overtime just like always." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alda {{burst out}} laughing. 'People {{can only do}} what they can. Marilda trying to be graceful would be worse than Marilda floundering her own way. But she really is the best and kindest girl living, and she gets on much <b>better</b> <b>for</b> having <b>me</b> to keep her out of scrapes.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, it's a {{straight}} road. That's Albemarle Street down there--follow it till {{it takes you}} out to the country, and then keep straight on till {{you come to a}} church painted yellow and white. Turn to your right, and over the hill is Hopedale. But you'd <b>better</b> wait <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You don't look fit to walk five miles." ...|$|R
2500|$|Moira Kelly portrays Karen Roe, Lucas's mother. Kelly said, [...] "as long as {{they keep}} Karen [...] the words of wisdom, the kind of sane one, {{the one who is}} trying to make her son {{understand}} what it is that they're really going through at this age, you know, that she keeps it together, then I'm happy because it's nice to be the voice of reason. It's <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> personally, {{to have that kind of}} role, especially on that kind of show that's geared towards teenagers. There's got to be, I feel, a role model that says, 'Okay look, it seems this way right now, but it may very well be this way later. Dan abandoned Karen after she became pregnant in high school. With help from Dan's brother Keith, who in later years is her lover and father of her second child, Karen raises Lucas to strive for his best potential.|$|E
2500|$|When Davout marched from Naumburg {{to glory}} at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused {{to join his}} fellow marshal despite {{positive}} orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt. Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy. The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary, [...] "This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial {{it will be the}} equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not to speak to him about it, but I shall take care he shall know what I think of his behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him." [...] In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife Désirée Clary, whom he almost married.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to know what happens at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether it would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to let go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish here with my death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to let myself die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, until I came around." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} I had {{nothing of the}} sort, {{and gave him a}} wider berth. If he had known, his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket, and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt. But by the <b>better</b> luck <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and lied on in the dark.|$|R
5000|$|A Roman Catholic, Oliverio {{says that}} it is God's will whether or not he wins election. [...] He told the Times West Virginian: [...] "We start every {{campaign}} by putting it in God’s hands. And we know that his will shall be done. And if it is his will for us to win, we will win. And if not, he has a higher and <b>better</b> purpose <b>for</b> <b>me</b> somewhere else." ...|$|R

2500|$|While {{studying}} at the University of California Summer session in 1928, Wedge met Jennie Mina Holliday, a fellow student, {{with whom he}} soon fell in love, and decided to marry after she had visited him several times when he was hospitalized after his August 1928 suicide attempt. However, his friend Dr. Lapsley Armstrong McAfee (born on March 31, 1864 in Ashley, Missouri; died Dumaguete, Philippine Islands, on January 18, 1935), pastor of the Berkeley Presbyterian Church, refused to perform the ceremony, as it was incompatible with Presbyterian beliefs on divorce and remarriage. Rev. Chauncey David Norris, pastor of the Church of the Nazarene in Berkeley, California, agreed to perform the ceremony. However, after Wedge's denominational leaders protested his intention to marry Holloway, {{as she had been}} divorced on the grounds of incompatibility, Wedge decided to break his engagement to Holloway and cancel the wedding. Three hours before the wedding Wedge sent a special delivery letter to Holloway: [...] "It is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to remain a lonely Presbyterian minister than to marry you and break God's law. The Bible is against our marriage. While your husband is still living I would be breaking God's law by living with you, even though the laws of California sanction it". However, within hours he reconsidered and announced his intention to resign as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Oakland, California and also from the Presbyterian denomination and to marry Holloway. The wedding was held in the evening of January 25, 1929, two hours later than scheduled, in Holloway's Oakland home, with Hugh Wedge as best man and Holloway's daughter, Mrs Jeanette Dale, the bridesmaid.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was never}} World {{champion}} {{so it is}} my biggest victory so far! I {{was focused on the}} individual pursuit, everything for me was on that. My individual pursuit was good, but I was fifth and just missed the finals. I was very disappointed because I also missed the Olympic Games, because I only started riding [...] on the track four months ago. I didn't have enough points to ride in the individual pursuit in the Olympics." [...] About the scratch race she continued: [...] "My plan was to attack about 10 laps from the finish, I wanted to go when the speed was a bit lower. I did it about eight laps before the finish. I was surprised, but every country has just one rider so they don't work together. That was <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to ride away. I didn't look behind, just once," [...] she added. [...] "I knew I had to give it everything and if there was no gap, then there was no gap. But it worked out well." [...] Despite having quite a considerable gap coming into the final lap, Van Dijk refused to believe that the race was won until the very end. She detailed the point at which she realised that she was definitely going to triumph. [...] "Just 100 metres before the finish," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't know how big the gap was , I didn't look back, I was just focused on riding hard and getting everything out." [...] A few days on from the frustration of non-qualification, her new rainbow jersey and gold medal provide her {{with a great deal of}} compensation. [...] "I was really, really disappointed with that," [...] she confirmed. [...] "But this makes up for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{character}} interactions, Greenberg noted {{how there}} was [...] "a lot of dialogue between Jimmy and Mandy in the car. We {{used a lot}} of car mounts. I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you could see all the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper." [...] The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting {{to identify with the}} aliens regarding a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, [...] "We ended up with very deep, strong blue – a sort of moonlight blue. We tried to do all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places." [...] Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, [...] "I figured out from tests that it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. I can control the contrast with light, but I {{have to live with the}} grain." [...] Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, [...] "Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras." ...|$|E
60|$|Lord Erskine {{thinks that}} ministers {{must be in}} peril of going out. So much the <b>better</b> <b>for</b> him. To <b>me</b> {{it is the same}} who are in or out;--we want {{something}} more than a change of ministers, and some day we will have it.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} <b>better</b> <b>for</b> you and <b>me,</b> Miss Bessie. We {{can have a}} {{pleasant}} talk. Where is that black monkey Jantje? Here, Jantje, take my horse, you ugly devil, and mind you look after him, or I'll cut the liver out of you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. It {{is because}} it is not couleur de rose that I am so much bent upon it. I have had plenty of that all my life. I expect much that will be very disagreeable and not at all heroic; but if I can only make Norman think it fun, that will be one purpose answered. I do believe he will do his work <b>better</b> <b>for</b> having <b>me,</b> and, at least, I shall pay his passage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{you have}} had two more years' regimental work than I have had. It {{would have been much}} <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> if I had had a longer spell of it, too. Of course, I have been {{extraordinarily}} fortunate, and it has been very jolly; but I am sure it would have been <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to have had more experience as a subaltern, before all this began." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{spelling}} {{is frequently}} desperate, {{but it was}} Susy's, and it shall stand. I love it, and cannot profane it. To me, it is gold. To correct it would alloy it, not refine it. It would spoil it. It would take from it its freedom and flexibility and make it stiff and formal. Even when it is most extravagant I am not shocked. It is Susy's spelling, and she was doing the best she could--and nothing could <b>better</b> it <b>for</b> <b>me....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “It may be, father, that I did not {{sufficiently}} recognize that silence was golden. In any case my friends recommended {{me to take}} a long journey, because they thought it would be <b>better</b> and safer <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to travel to Brazil; and as there were reasons against my taking a passage by sea, there was nothing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> but to strike across the continent.” ...|$|R
