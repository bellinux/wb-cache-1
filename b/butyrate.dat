5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, <b>butyrate</b> esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
25|$|Short chain {{fatty acid}} (<b>butyrate)</b> enema. The {{epithelial}} {{cells in the}} colon uses <b>butyrate</b> from {{the contents of the}} intestine as an energy source. The amount of <b>butyrate</b> available decreases toward the rectum. Inadequate <b>butyrate</b> levels in the lower intestine have been suggested as a contributing factor for the disease. This might be addressed through <b>butyrate</b> enemas. The results however are not conclusive.|$|E
25|$|The major SCFAs {{in humans}} are <b>butyrate,</b> {{propionate}}, and acetate, where <b>butyrate</b> {{is the major}} energy source for colonocytes, propionate is destined for uptake by the liver, and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl <b>butyrate,</b> ethyl caproate, n-hexyl <b>butyrate</b> and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E

25|$|Two major {{strategies}} used for monitoring and controlling V. pensylvanica include trapping with synthetic chemical attractants and tree shaking. Experiments on chemical attractants of V. pensylvanica and other generalist wasps show {{the effectiveness of}} using acetic acid in combination with these chemicals separately: isobutanol, heptyl <b>butyrate,</b> and butyl <b>butyrate.</b> Acetic acid alone {{did not have the}} same attractive effects as the chemical combinations. Using a vial dispenser, releasing up to an estimated 2.3 mg of heptyl <b>butyrate</b> per hour increased the number of yellowjackets attracted. In Hawaii, the Christmas tree is a large seasonal import each year. Over 90% of these trees contain live insects. Although V. pensylvanica typically resides in ground nests, queens occasionally choose these trees as overwintering sites. One potential strategy {{to reduce the number of}} yellowjackets and other generalist predators is applying preharvest permethrin sprays in combination with mechanical tree-shaking.|$|E

25|$|Removing {{meat and}} alcohol from the diet has a {{significant}} impact in {{the reduction of the}} relapses for ulcerative colitis patients. Meat and alcohol contain higher levels of sulphuric amino acids, producing greater amounts of hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to the colonocyte and inhibits <b>butyrate.</b>|$|E

However, particularly on exterior applications, they introduce maintenance {{into what is}} naturally a maintenance-free material. They are organic chemicals that are dry at ambient temperatures or require heat for curing or solvent evaporation. Examples of clear organic coatings include alkyd, acrylic, cellulose acetate <b>butyrate,</b> epoxy, nitrocellulose, silicone, and urethane. Further details are available.|$|E
25|$|This system {{functions}} {{similarly to}} the branch-chain fatty acid synthesizing system, however it uses short-chain carboxylic acids as primers instead of alpha-keto acids. In general, {{this method is}} used by bacteria {{that do not have}} the ability to perform the branch-chain fatty acid system using alpha-keto primers. Typical short-chain primers include isovalerate, isobutyrate, and 2-methyl <b>butyrate.</b> In general, the acids needed for these primers are taken up from the environment; this is often seen in ruminal bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, <b>butyrate)</b> or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol). From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the esterification, and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).|$|E
25|$|Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, {{oligosaccharides}} and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain {{fatty acids}} (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The cecal fermentation of 40–50g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400–500mmol total short-chain fatty acids, 240–300mmol acetate, and 80–100mmol of both propionate and <b>butyrate.</b> Almost {{all of these}} short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, {{the ability of the}} fiber residue to sequestrate short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.|$|E

Symbiotic butyrate-producing bacteria which are normally present in the intestine are sometimes used as probiotics to help suppress H. pylori infections {{as an adjunct to}} antibiotic therapy. [...] <b>Butyrate</b> itself is an antimicrobial which destroys the cell envelope of H. pylori by inducing regulatory T cell expression (specifically, FOXP3) and synthesis of an antimicrobial peptide called LL-37, which arises through its action as a histone deacetylase inhibitor ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{combination}} of succinate and ethanol can be fermented to produce <b>butyrate</b> (a precursor to butanol fuel) by utilizing the metabolic pathways {{present in a}} gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Clostridium kluyveri. Succinate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle, which metabolizes glucose. Anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium saccharobutylicum also contain these pathways. Succinate is first activated and then reduced by a two-step reaction to give 4-hydroxybutyrate, which is then metabolized further to crotonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) [...] [...] Crotonyl-CoA is then converted to <b>butyrate.</b> The genes corresponding to these butanol production pathways from Clostridium were cloned to E. coli.|$|E
2500|$|Syntrophy, in {{the context}} of {{microbial}} metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a chemical reaction that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable. [...] The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, ethanol and <b>butyrate)</b> by organisms such as Syntrophomonas. [...] Alone, the oxidation of <b>butyrate</b> to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable. [...] However, when a hydrogenotrophic (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10−5 atm) and thereby shift the equilibrium of the <b>butyrate</b> oxidation reaction under standard conditions (ΔGº’) to non-standard conditions (ΔG’). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is [...] "pulled" [...] towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for <b>butyrate</b> oxidation: ΔGº’= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ΔG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10−5 atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from ΔGº’= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to ΔG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10−5 atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer. [...] In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual mineralization of these compounds. [...] These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and [...]|$|E
2500|$|Beneficial {{bacteria}} {{also can}} contribute to the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal immune system. For example Clostridia, one of the most predominant bacterial groups in the GI tract, {{play an important role in}} influencing the dynamics of the gut's immune system. It has been demonstrated that the intake of a high fiber diet could be the responsible for the induction of T-regulatory cells (Tregs). This is due to the production of short-chain fatty acids during the fermentation of plant-derived nutrients [...] such as <b>butyrate</b> and propionate. [...] Basically, the <b>butyrate</b> induces the differentiation of Treg cells by enhancing histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the FOXP3 locus, thus regulating the T cells, resulting in the reduction of the inflammatory response and allergies.|$|E

[...] This is done to reduce if not eliminate the level of fusel oil. [...] Singani manufacturers take care to keep undesirable substances out of the product so that the characteristic terpenol profile dominates and is not blemished by off-odors such as grassiness (amyl alcohol), pineapple (ethyl <b>butyrate),</b> and other congeners.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bacteria}} {{break down}} some of the fiber for their own nourishment and create acetate, propionate, and <b>butyrate</b> as waste products, which in turn are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. No protein is made available. In humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available, thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. [...] The large intestine produces no digestive enzymes — chemical digestion is completed in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. The pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).|$|E
2500|$|EGCG, a {{polyphenol}} {{in green}} tea, has {{shown in a}} study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription and protein levels in a time and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected. [...] Specific inhibitors (to the pathways) suggest that Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway contributes to EBV lytic infection though BZLF1 and PI3-K pathway through BRLF1, the latter completely abrogating {{the ability of a}} BRLF1 adenovirus vector to induce the lytic form of EBV infection. [...] Additionally, the activation of some genes but not others is being studied to determine just how to induce immune destruction of latently infected B-cells by use of either TPA or sodium <b>butyrate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Fermentation is a {{specific}} type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses organic carbon instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to [...] and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of [...] for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis). [...] As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are anaerobic. [...] Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and aerobic respiration when oxygen is present. [...] These organisms are facultative anaerobes. [...] To avoid the overproduction of NADH, obligately fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle. [...] Instead of using an ATP synthase as in respiration, ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation where a phosphate group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to ADP to form ATP. [...] As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of Coenzyme A-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other cofactors to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including hydrogen gas (...) [...] These reduced organic compounds are generally small organic acids and alcohols derived from pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis. Examples include ethanol, acetate, lactate, and <b>butyrate.</b> Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.|$|E

50|$|<b>Butyrate</b> {{is a major}} {{metabolite}} in colonic lumen {{arising from}} bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and {{has been shown to}} be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. <b>Butyrate</b> possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer. One mechanism underlying <b>butyrate</b> function in suppression of colonic inflammation is inhibition of the IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling pathways at least partially through acting as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. While transient IFN-γ signaling is generally associated with normal host immune response, chronic IFN-γ signaling is often associated with chronic inflammation. It has been shown that <b>Butyrate</b> inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and upregulation of Fas receptor on the T cell surface. It is thus suggested that <b>butyrate</b> enhances apoptosis of T cells in the colonic tissue and thereby eliminates the source of inflammation (IFN-γ production). <b>Butyrate</b> inhibits angiogenesis by inactivating Sp1 transcription factor activity and downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression.|$|E
