40|$|Abstract The <b>balance</b> <b>score</b> <b>card</b> (BSC) is a {{management}} system that maps an organization’s strategic objectives into performance with four perspectives such as financial, internal business perspectives, customers, and learning and growth which provide relevant feedback {{as to how}} well the strategic plan is executing so that adjustment can be made if necessary. The <b>score</b> <b>card</b> itself is essentially a performance measurement frame work with two key objectives; converting strategy into specific goals for different sections of the organization, and communicating that strategy to {{all parts of the}} organization. Hence the associations between four perspectives in <b>balance</b> <b>score</b> <b>card</b> and performance should be examined. Various studies have been done on the above theme, but no enough studies have been conducted in Sri Lankan context, especially in banking sector. Thus the present study is initiated on “Balance <b>score</b> <b>Card</b> and business performance as a comparative study of state and private sector banking Organizations in Srilanka “with a samples of 143 respondents in 16 banking organizations in eastern provinces. The results from the operational hypotheses indicates that total perspectives (CP, IBP, LGP, and FP) have a significant relationship with business performance which means, as the total perspectives increase business performance increases in state banks and private banks. Whereas learning growth perspectives and customer perspectives significantly contributes to total perspectives in both banks are important contributors to positive Business performance, specially learning growth perspectives are significantly impact on state banks.

It supplies most of transport and travel needs and provides petrochemical business raw material, {{which is one}} of the infrastructure industries. Considering the importance of petroleum downstream and due to a very volatile crude and product market, one of the industry’s main targets is to meet customers’ requirements with administrating downstream supply chain efficiently. Supply chain management (SCM) is a strategic tool to enhance an organization’s productivity, profitability and certifying the success of business. Performance of SCM can indicate how successfully the supply chain is able to deal with its aim, which is increasing profit by increasing value to the customer. For evaluating the performance of SCM, a measurement system is required to determine its progress toward the main goal. In this thesis, the main concern is to propose a performance measurement method which is applicable for petroleum downstream SCM. For this purpose literature review is used to develop a model in Iran petroleum downstream. As a result of the research a numerical performance measurement model is suggested for Iranian downstream petroleum industry which is a combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and <b>Balance</b> <b>Score</b> <b>card</b> (BSC).

The respondents {{in this study were}} a group of Marketing managers working in the Hospitality Sector (Experiences in number of years) of Madina, Saudi Arabia Hospitality. It has been observed trough literature and a limited Marketing Managers’ survey that only financial perspective measures are used with objectives. <b>Balanced</b> <b>Score</b> <b>Card</b> (BSC) enables to measure objectives across four perspectives: (1) the financial perspective, (2) the customer perspective, (3) the internal business process perspective, and (4) the learning and growth perspective.
