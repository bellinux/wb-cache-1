40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis three-dimensional {{scalar data}} is visualized using isosurfaces. The given data is {{the output of}} simulations of T cells in the lymph nodes. Some of these cells produce a <b>biochemical</b> <b>substance</b> of which the concentration distribution is of interest. Peculiarities of the given data are that the values range over several orders of magnitude and that the domain has holes. This leads to holes in the isosurfaces. Difficulties when using isosurfaces are the fact that isosurfaces can be hidden by others and that the resulting image representations {{can be hard to}} interpret. These problems are solved by using varying transparencies for different isovalues. The quality of visualizations using isosurfaces also highly depends on the choice and number of the isovalues. In order to choose those isosurfaces that represent important features of the data, topological information is computed. For this purpose, an algorithm originally applied to grayscale images of CT scans is modified to use it on the scalar data. The algorithm computes the Morse complex of the data, which can then be utilized to determine the persistent homology classes and corresponding Betti numbers.

40|$|Abstract—Statistical {{methods for}} {{detecting}} and estimating biochemical dispersion by a moving source using model-based integrated sensor array processing are developed. Two possible cases are considered: a homogeneous semi-infinite medium (corre-sponding {{to the environment}} such as air above the ground for an airborne source) or a two-layer semi-infinite medium (e. g., shallow water). The proposed methods can be extended to more complex scenarios. The goals are to detect and localize the biochemical source, determine the space–time concentration distribution of the dispersion, and predict its cloud evolution. Potential appli-cations include security, environmental monitoring, pollution control, simulating hazardous accidents, and explosives detection. Diffusion models of the <b>biochemical</b> <b>substance</b> concentration dis-tribution are derived under various boundary and environmental conditions. A maximum-likelihood algorithm is used to estimate the biochemical concentration distribution in space and time, and the Cramér–Rao bound is computed to analyze its performance. Two detectors (generalized-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and a mean-difference detector) are derived and then their perfor-mances are determined {{in terms of the}} probabilities of detection and false alarm. The results can be used to design the sensor array for optimal performance. Numerical examples illustrate the results of the concentration distribution and the performances of the proposed methods.
