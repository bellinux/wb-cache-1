5|$|After the ten-day campaign, the Israelis were {{military}} {{superior to}} their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered {{where and when}} to attack next. Three options were offered: attacking the Arabic enclave in Galilee held by the Arab Liberation Army; moving eastward {{as far as possible}} in Samarian and Judean areas, taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> and Jordanians; or attacking southern Negev taken by the Egyptians.|$|E
25|$|The flank screen {{maneuver}} {{took place}} {{along the southern}} boundaries between the 2 ACR and 3rd Armored Division operational areas. Task Forces 4-34 and 4-32 were advancing from the rear. The general movement of the US forces followed an eastward direction. The fumes from hundreds of oil wells set on fire <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> combined with an intense shamal, forced the US vehicles to use thermal sights.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} {{night of the}} war, an F-15E fired a AIM-9 Sidewinder at a MiG-29, which failed to hit its target. Other F-15Es {{simultaneously}} and unsuccessfully engaged the lone MiG-29, which was eventually brought down by a missile of unknown source. On 18 January, during a strike against a petrol oil and lubricant plant near Basrah, an F-15E was lost to enemy fire, the pilot and WSO were killed. F-15E crews described this mission as the most difficult and dangerous of the war as it was heavily defended by SA-3s, SA-6s, SA-8s and Rolands {{as well as by}} anti-aircraft artillery. Two nights later, a second and final F-15E was downed by an Iraqi SA-2; the crew survived and evaded capture for several days and made in contact with coalition aircraft, but rescue was not launched due to security issues, one airman failed to identify himself with proper codes. The two airmen were later captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis.</b>|$|E

25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Democratic {{leadership}} as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević. In 1996 he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.|$|E
2500|$|According to retired Army Colonel W. Patrick Lang, senior defense {{intelligence}} {{officer for the}} United States Defense Intelligence Agency at the time, [...] "the use of gas on the battlefield <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> was {{not a matter of}} deep strategic concern" [...] to Reagan and his aides, because they [...] "were desperate to make sure that Iraq did not lose." [...] Lang disclosed that more than 60 officers of the Defense Intelligence Agency were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments. He cautioned that the DIA [...] "would have never accepted the use of chemical weapons against civilians, but the use against military objectives was seen as inevitable in the Iraqi struggle for survival." [...] The Reagan administration did not stop aiding Iraq after receiving reports affirming the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians.|$|E
2500|$|The Arab villagers of {{the area}} known as the [...] "Little Triangle" [...] south of Haifa, {{repeatedly}} fired at Israeli traffic along the main road from Tel Aviv to Haifa and were supplied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> from northern Samaria. The sniping at traffic continued during the Second Truce. The poorly planned assaults on 18 June and 8 July had failed to dislodge Arab militia from their superior positions. The Israelis launched Operation Shoter on 24 July {{in order to gain}} control of the main road to Haifa and to destroy all the enemy in the area. Israeli assaults on 24 and 25 July were beaten back by stiff resistance. The Israelis then broke the Arab defenses with an infantry and armour assault backed by heavy artillery shelling and aerial bombing. Three Arab villages surrendered, and most of the inhabitants fled before and during the attack. The Israeli soldiers and aircraft struck at one of the Arab retreat routes, killing 60 Arab soldiers.. Most of the inhabitants fled before and during the attack, reaching northern Samaria; hundreds were forcibly expelled during the following days. At least a hundred militiamen and civilians were killed.|$|E
