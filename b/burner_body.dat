40|$|The {{influence}} of pulsed nanosecond silent (or barrier) discharge on the flame velocity was investigated for propane/air {{mixture in a}} wide range of equivalence ratios at atmospheric pressure. It was experimentally obtained that blow-off flow rates are more than twice increased as compared to the system without silent discharge. Discharge energy input is less then 1 % of burner power. This effect is explained by the formation of atomic oxygen in silent discharge followed by acceleration of limiting chemical reactions. Experiment A set-up consisted of burner, pulse high-voltage power supply, gas supply system and diagnostic system has been used to settle the problem (fig. 1). The <b>burner</b> <b>body</b> is made of glass. The exit section is a rectangle with 30 mm x 2 mm dimensions, so flame basis is long enough to work in a 1 D geometry. Multipoint brass plate with rectangle section 1 mm x 28 mm is used as a high-voltage electrode and placed into the nozzle parallel to its walls. Low-voltage electrodes are made of copper foil, placed into the quartz tubes and positioned near the burner nozzle. The distances between high voltage electrode and quartz tubes can be varied [1]. One of the advantages of such construction is the fact that voltage and discharge power are limited from above only by high-voltage generator intrinsic properties; the transition from streamer phase to spark form is impossible because of dielectric barrier. coaxial cable gas supply system premixed flame quartz tubes high-voltage electrode (positive polarity) glass burner grounded electrodes back current shunt quartz condenser high-voltage pulsed generator Monocromator MDR- 12 objective aperture mixing chambe...|$|E

In this work, a fourth generation SIT (Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery) burner is studied to gain information about the formation of NOX emissions. The gas mixtures for the full burner are limited to natural gas with different nitrogen dilutions. The dilutions vary from undiluted to Wobbe index 40 and 30 MJ/m 3. In addition to the full <b>burner,</b> the central <b>body</b> (the RPL – Rich/Pilot/Lean) is investigated. Methane is used to characterize standard gas turbine operation, and a non-standard fuel is explored using a generic syngas (67. 5 % Hydrogen, 22. 5 % Carbon monoxide and 10 % Methane). Both these gases are also investigated after dilution with nitrogen to a Wobbe index of 15 MJ/m 3. The experiments are performed in a high-pressure facility. The pressures for the central <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> are 3, 6 and 9 bar. For the full burner the pressures are 3, 4. 5 and 6 bar. The combustion air is preheated to 650 K.

The results are compared with previous investigations made at atmospheric conditions. The burner is modeled using a PSR and plug flow network to show which reaction paths are important in the formation of emissions for the burner under the experimental conditions.

The present work aims the characterization of a natural gas/air partially premixed flame (PPF) reactive flow in a bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> under laminar conditions in equivalence ratio of 2. 1, 1. 7 and 1. 2. The laboratorial bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> is composed of a central outflow for the premixed reactants and an annular air flow. The latter allows for the stabilization of the flame meanwhile it prevents external aerodynamic influence {{on the behavior of}} the flame. For the velocity field measurements, a 2 -D Particle Image Velocimetry, PIV, optical diagnostic system is employed. The PIV system comprises of two Nd:YAG lasers with an output wavelength of 532 nm. Titanium dioxide particles, TiO 2, are used as seeding particles in the premixed flow. The displacement of the seeding particles between two laser pulses with a known short time difference allows a planar velocity field determination. The stored images are processed using a software integrated with the system in order to obtain the medium velocity field. The software uses statistic data to obtain the correlation between two images acquired in an interval of time of an overlapped interrogation window. The major objective {{of this study is to}} examine the flame velocity field of laminar partially premixed natural gas and air flames in rich conditions.

40|$|AbstractThermal {{structure}} of stabilized confined jet diffusion flames {{in the presence}} of different geometries of bluff <b>body</b> <b>burners</b> has been mathematically modeled. Two stabilizer disc burners tapered at 30 ° and 60 ° and another frusted cone of 60 °/ 30 ° inclination angle were employed all having the same diameter of 80 (mm) acting as flame holders. The measured radial mean temperature profiles of the developing stabilizing flames at different normalized axial distances were considered as the model example of the physical process. A polynomial mathematical model of fourth degree has been investigated to study this phenomenon to find the best correlation representing the experimental data. Least Squares regression analysis has been employed to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial and investigate its adequacy. High values for R 2 > 0. 9 obtained for most of the investigated bluff burners at the various locations of x/dj prove the adequacy of the suggested polynomial for representing the experimental results. Very small values of significance F<(α= 0. 05) for all investigated cases indicate that there is a real relationship between the independent variable r and the dependant variable T.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis comprises of a thorough assessment of turbulent non-premixed combustion modelling techniques, emphasising the fundamental issue of turbulence-chemistry interaction. The combustion models studied are the flame-sheet, equilibrium, eddy breakup and laminar flamelet models. An in-house CFD code is developed and all the combustion models are implemented. Fundamental numerical issues involving the discretisation schemes are addressed by employing three discretisation schemes namely, hybrid, power law and TVD. The combustion models are evaluated {{for a number of}} fuels ranging from simple H 2 /CO and CO/H 2 /N 2 to more complex Cl 4 /H 2 burning in bluff <b>body</b> stabilised <b>burners</b> at different inlet fuel velocities. The bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> with its complex recirculation zone provides a suitable model problem for industrial flows. The initial and boundary conditions are simple and well-defined. The bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> also provides a controlled environment for the study of turbulence-chemistry interaction at the neck zone. The high quality experimental database available from the University of Sydney and other reported measurements are used for the validation and evaluation of combustion models. The present calculations show that all the combustion models provide good predictions for near equilibrium flames for temperature and major species. Although the equilibrium chemistry model is capable of predicting minor species, the predictive accuracy is found to be inadequate when compared to the experimental data. The laminae flamelet model is the only model which has yielded good predictions for the minor species. For flames at higher velocities. the laminar flamelet model again has provided better predictions compared to predictions of other models considered. With different fuels, the laminar flamelet model predictions for CO/H 2 /N 2 fuel are better than those for CH 4 /H 2 fuel. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed in detail. The effects of differential diffusion are studied in the laminar flamelet modelling strategy. The flamelet with unity Lewis number is found to give a better representation of the transport of species. The laminar flamelet model has yielded reasonably good predictions for NO mass fraction. The predictions of NO mass fraction are found to be very sensitive to differential diffusion effects. This study has also considered the issue of inclusion of radiative heat transfer in the laminar flamelet model. The radiation effects are found to be important only where the temperature is very high. The study undertaken and reported in this thesis shows that the presently available laminar flamelet modelling concepts are capable of predicting species concentrations and temperature fields with an adequate degree of accuracy. The flamelet model is also well suited for the prediction of NO emissions. The inclusion of radiation heat transfer has enhanced the predictive capability of the laminar flamelet model...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{ultra-low}} emissions of both NOX and CO {{it is imperative to}} move the blow out limit towards leaner equivalence ratios and by supplying heat and reactive species to the flame zone the lean stability limit can be lowered. Heat and reactive species can be supplied to the flame zone by use of a pre-chamber combustor. In this study a central <b>body</b> <b>burner,</b> called the RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean), is used as a pre-chamber combustor to supply heat and radicals to a downscaled industrial burner. Emission probe measurements have been used for detection of the lean blow out limit for Methane and a generic Syngas (10 % CH 4, 67. 5 % H 2, and 22. 5 % CO). The syngas was also investigated after being diluted with nitrogen to Wobbe index 15 MJ/m 3. In addition, OH-LIF measurements show the exhaust gases from the central body continue to react with the surrounding air. The lean blow out limit is modeled using two perfectly stirred reactors (PSR) in series. By using PSR reactors the chemical influence on lean blow out limit can be isolated. The resulting trends for modeled lean blow out limit are in agreement with both measured data and the visualized OH distribution of the OH-LIF images. Increasing the equivalence ratio in the RPL, thus increasing the supplied fuel energy, is a major contributor for the combustion stability up to a limit where the temperature drop is too large. For leaner RPL combustion the reactive species O, H, and OH in combination enhance the stability beyond the thermal influence. At richer equivalence ratios in the RPL the conversion of methane to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in the RPL, is an important factor influencing the lean blow out limit besides the temperature...|$|R

The Cartesian computational grid consists of 1. 6 billion cells with {{a resolution of}} 100 mu m, which is sufficient to capture the laminar (thermal) flame thickness of 500 mu m. The combustion process is modeled with premixed flamelet generated manifolds (PFGM). The quality of the simulation is assessed by investigating {{the resolution of the}} flame- and velocity scales, it is demonstrated that the relevant scales are resolved in a direct numerical simulation (DNS) sense in the flame. The simulation is validated by comparing temporal statistics of velocity, temperature and major species mass fractions against experimental results. It is shown that the combustion regime varies with the distance from the burner and the progress of the reaction. Ensemble-averaged statistics, conditional means and averages along turbulent flamelets are compared against reference data from unstrained premixed one-dimensional flames. The analysis is carried out with respect to previous findings from DNS of much simpler flame configurations featuring synthetic turbulence. It is concluded that the major physical properties are comparable. In other words, most of the findings from previous DNS studies for canonical cases are relevant, at least for the lab scale jet-flame examined here. The flame normal strain is found to be aligned with the most compressive strain rate. The mean principal curvature of the progress variable iso-surfaces is predominantly zero and skewed towards positive values, the turbulent flame structure is mainly slightly thinned compared to the laminar one. The displacement speed of the flame is found to take partially negative values. The lack of correlation between the displacement speed and the consumption speed is also reported, the correlation being achieved considering the normal component of the diffusive flux only.

The analyses {{are based on}} a flame resolved simulation (quasi DNS) and large eddy simulations of the bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> experiment by Hochgreb and Barlow with premixed flamelet generated manifolds (PFGM). Both flame resolved simulation and LES are performed under the conditions of a single real flame experiment, using the same domain size, filter sizes, boundary conditions and numerics, all with an additional validation by comparison to experimental data. For the evaluation of the sub-filter wrinkling factor, the well-established model by Charlette et al. (2002) in the modified version by Wang et al. (2011) is used with a static and with a dynamic model parameter, a new dynamic power-law model is discussed additionally. In the a priori analysis, the probability density functions (PDFs) of the sub-grid scale (SGS) wrinkling factor are compared against the modeled ones based on the flame resolved simulation data. These a-priori modeled wrinkling factor PDFs are then compared against the a-posteriori ones from the LES results, where a similar shape is observed for all models. The static model tends to over-predict the wrinkling factor, a better agreement is found for the dynamic models for the medium and small filter width, where the new formulation improves the results for the latter. For the largest filter width, the wrinkling factor is under predicted by the dynamic models. This under-prediction is, however, compensated by larger gradients of the progress variable field so that the mean flame surface density conditioned on the progress variable is in closer agreement with the flame resolved simulation than the wrinkling factor PDFs are. Finally, radial profiles of the time-averaged temperature from the LES, flame resolved simulation and experiment are compared against each other. With the dynamic SGS wrinkling models, the LES results converge with grid refinement against the flame resolved simulation results. (C) 2017 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Combustor blowout is a {{very serious}} concern in modern {{land-based}} and aircraft engine combustors. The ability to sense blowout precursors can provide significant payoffs in engine reliability and life. The objective of this work is to characterize the blowout phenomenon and develop a sensing methodology which can detect and assess the proximity of a combustor to blowout by monitoring its acoustic signature, thus providing early warning before the actual blowout of the combustor. The first part of the work examines the blowout phenomenon in a piloted jet burner. As blowout was approached, the flame detached {{from one side of the}} burner and showed increased flame tip fluctuations, resulting in an increase in low frequency acoustics. Work was then focused on swirling combustion systems. Close to blowout, localized extinction/re-ignition events were observed, which manifested as bursts in the acoustic signal. These events increased in number and duration as the combustor approached blowout, resulting an increase in low frequency acoustics. A variety of spectral, wavelet and thresholding based approaches were developed to detect precursors to blowout. The third part of the study focused on a bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner.</b> It characterized the underlying flame dynamics near blowout in greater detail and related it to the observed acoustic emissions. Vorticity was found to play a significant role in the flame dynamics. The flame passed through two distinct stages prior to blowout. The first was associated with momentary strain levels that exceed the flames extinction strain rate, leading to flame holes. The second was due to large scale alteration of the fluid dynamics in the bluff body wake, leading to violent flapping of the flame front and even larger straining of the flame. This led to low frequency acoustic oscillations, of the order of von Karman vortex shedding. This manifested as an abrupt increase in combustion noise spectra at 40 - 100 Hz very close to blowout. Finally, work was also done to improve the robustness of lean blowout detection by developing integration techniques that combined data from acoustic and optical sensors. Ph. D.

The key contributions of this thesis are as follows: 1) Modification of in-house CFD code for turbulent reacting flow and development of CFD based iterative scheme for the turbulent diffusion flames to account for radiation heat loss from combustion and flame zones. 2) Thorough assessment of turbulent combustion modelling techniques for different cases of diffusion flames, demonstration of the importance of differential diffusion in the flamelet modelling of combustion and comprehensive validation 3) Demonstration of the importance of radiation heat loss in the modelling of turbulent combustion, implementation of radiation modelling in the three cases of diffusion flames and comprehensive validation of CFD based combustion radiation results. 4) Development of modelling strategy for the pollutants like oxides of nitrogen (NOx), implementation of NOx modelling in the different flames cases and identified the effect of radiation heat loss on NOx formation. The works addressed in this thesis are presented with the applications to turbulent diffusion flame combustors. However, these works can easily be extended to the industrial applications and applied to a large variety of other challenging domains. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

One such technology {{is based on the}} use of hydrogen or hydrogen-enriched fuels and allows for a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions. All regulated pollutant emissions, except for harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx), can also be reduced using hydrogen. Hydrogen’s unique properties are challenging for burner designers. High hydrogen-air flame temperatures and flame speeds result in increased NOx emissions and significant changes in flame shape compared with conventional fuels. A novel burner concept employing partially premixed combustion and flame stabilization on a conical bluff body is here proposed to address some of these challenges. In this study a laboratory-scale burner which can operate with methane, hydrogenenriched methane and pure hydrogen has been studied. The burner performance and pollutant emissions were found to depend on factors such as fuel composition, thermal load, excess air and the burner design parameters. Particular burner operation settings affected near-burner aerodynamics and consequently NOx emissions. In more detail, {{it was found that the}} flow past the bluff <b>body</b> <b>burner</b> head exhibited vortex shedding contributing to enhanced fuel-air mixing and formed a recirculation zone behind the burner head. Flame presence increased turbulent kinetic energy production near the shear layer of the recirculation zone. The burner operated within the highly turbulent flow regime and significant turbulent kinetic energy was contained at the small scales of the flow. The burner operation was controlled by two parameters: position of the burner head and the fuel split between primary and secondary fuel ports. When the burner head was shifted upstream, NOx emissions were reduced for all fuels tested and the position of the burner head was an important parameter for the reduction of NOx emissions. This was attributed to shortened residence time in the high-temperature zone, enhanced fuel-air mixing and an increase in the amount of furnace flue gas entrained into the combustion zone. The burner head shifted upstream also resulted in lower flame stability and increased carbon monoxide emissions. Influence of the secondary fuel stream on the flow field and NOx emissions was relatively complex and affected by the remaining burner operation settings. Generally, NOx emissions increased when more fuel was provided to the burner through the secondary fuel ports. Some exceptions were observed and the secondary fuel fraction helped in reduction of NOx emissions from hydrogen combustion at low burner thermal loads. Depending on the mixing and the velocities in the burner, the secondary fuel may have penetrated the recirculation zone and the hot combustion products in this zone, what could have led to flame extinction. NOx emissions were largely dependent on the fuel composition. More hydrogen in the methane-hydrogen mixture resulted in higher NOx emissions. This is attributed to higher peak flame temperatures enhancing NOx formation via the thermal mechanism. Another factor was the furnace temperature. At higher furnace temperatures the radiative heat losses from the flame were reduced and consequently NOx emissions increased. Excess air could be used to suppress increase of NOx emissions, but it was only effective for methane and methane-hydrogen mixtures containing low fractions of hydrogen. It is believed that this effect was associated with the flame shape, which changed significantly between methane and hydrogen at given burner operation settings. Shorter and wider flames were characteristic for hydrogen combustion. The burner was capable of firing methane, hydrogen and mixtures of both of these fuels, but its operational settings had to be carefully chosen for each of these fuels in order to ensure safe burner operation and low NOx emissions. Empirical models developed on the basis of statistically cognizant experimental design allowed for NOx emissions prediction in a wide range of operating conditions. At the most promising burner operation settings and furnace temperatures of 1050 - 1150 °C, NOx emissions equivalent to 26 and 66 ppmvd at 3...|$|R
