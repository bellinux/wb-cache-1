The analysis predicts the overall system dynamics and the transmissibility {{to the gear}} box or the enclosed structure. The modal synthesis approach of the analysis treats the uncoupled lateral/torsional model characteristics of each stage or component independently. The vibration signature analysis evaluates the global dynamics coupling in the system. The method synthesizes the interaction of each modal component or stage with the nonlinear gear mesh dynamics and the modal support geometry characteristics. The analysis simulates transient and steady state vibration events to determine the resulting torque variations, speeds, changes, rotor imbalances, and support gear <b>box</b> <b>motion</b> excitations. A vibration signature analysis examines the overall dynamic characteristics of the system, and the individual model component responses. The gear box vibration analysis also examines the spectral characteristics of the support system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — It {{is undeniable}} {{that the ability}} to grasp and han-dle an object is vital for service robots. From object {{recognition}} to object grasping motion, the motion execution should be as fast as possible. Due to the possible position variation of the target object to be grasped, online planning of grasping motion should be done. In order to achieve flexible grasping motion, recurrent neural network could be implemented as an alternative to conventional manipulation method which is based on kinematic and dynamic analysis. However, the application of recurrent neural network model requires good and easily obtainable training data. Hence, a novel robotic arm design with high flexibility is proposed to facilitate the training and implementation of the recurrent neural network model. The feasibility of the proposed robotic arm design is evaluated via the training, learning and testing of stochastic continuous time recurrent neural network (S-CTRNN) model with grasping a <b>box</b> <b>motion.</b> I...|$|E

However, no studies have tested whether the critical vestibular signals originate in the semicircular canals, which detect angular head acceleration, or the otolith organs, which detect linear head acceleration and static pitch/tilt relative to gravity. We therefore evaluated the navigation performance in otoconia-deficient tilted mice and their littermate controls on a food-hoarding task. In light, food-restricted mice were trained to exit a start box {{in search of a}} single food item, and to carry the food directly back to the visible start box for consumption. After training was complete, a test phase was conducted in darkness, forcing animals to rely on idiothetic cues (e. g., proprioception, motor efference copy, vestibular) experienced during the outward journey in order to return directly to the start <b>box.</b> <b>Motion</b> capture software was used to quantify movement characteristics during a food hoarding trip. Each trip was divided into outward (i. e., departing the refuge to locating the food item) and homeward (i. e., locating the food item to contacting the refuge) components. Groups did not differ in outward segment path circuity, peak speed, or movement segmentation. However, the homeward segment for control mice was relatively direct, whereas the homeward journey for tilted mice was significantly more circuitous. These results suggest the otolith organs contribute to dead reckoning in darkness...|$|E
40|$|The work {{performed}} on global dynamic simulation and noise correlation of gear transmission systems at the University of Akron is outlined. The {{objective is to}} develop a comprehensive procedure to simulate the dynamics of the gear transmission system coupled with the effects of gear box vibrations. The developed numerical model is benchmarked with results from experimental tests at NASA Lewis Research Center. The modal synthesis approach is used to develop the global transient vibration analysis procedure used in the model. Modal dynamic characteristics of the rotor-gear-bearing system are calculated by the matrix transfer method while those of the gear box are evaluated by the finite element method (NASTRAN). A three-dimensional, axial-lateral coupled bearing model is used to couple the rotor vibrations with the gear <b>box</b> <b>motion.</b> The vibrations between the individual rotor systems are coupled through the nonlinear gear mesh interactions. The global equations of motion are solved in modal coordinates and the transient vibration of the system is evaluated by a variable time-stepping integration scheme. The relationship between housing vibration and resulting noise of the gear transmission system is generated by linear transfer functions using experimental data. A nonlinear relationship of the noise components to the fundamental mesh frequency is developed using the hypercoherence function. The numerically simulated vibrations and predicted noise of the gear transmission system are compared with the experimental results from the gear noise test rig at NASA Lewis Research Center. Results of the comparison indicate that the global dynamic model developed can accurately simulate the dynamics of a gear transmission system...|$|E

The engine was in generally terrible condition, with most fittings missing and the remainder of parts damaged, except the engine frames which were in surprisingly good condition by comparison. The tender tank had fittings removed and was scrapped at Moorooduc, being beyond repair, and the tender frame and the brake gear for the locomotive demonstrated significant collision damage.

40|$|Tracking the {{movements}} of a target based on limited observations {{plays a role in}} many interesting applications. Existing probabilistic tracking techniques have shown considerable success but the majority assume simplistic motion models suitable for short-term, local motion prediction. Agent movements are often governed by more sophisticated mechanisms such as a goal-directed pathplanning algorithm. In such contexts we must go beyond estimating a target’s current location to consider its future path and ultimate goal. We show how to use complex, “black <b>box</b> ” <b>motion</b> models to infer distributions over a target’s current position, origin, and destination, using only limited observations of the full path. Our approach accommodates motion models defined over a graph, including complex pathing algorithms such as A*. Robust and practical inference is achieved by using hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) and graph abstraction. The method has also been extended to effectively track multiple, indistinguishable agents via a greedy heuristic. ...|$|R
