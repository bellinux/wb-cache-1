50|$|Ontario knife {{company is}} most {{well known as}} a {{supplier}} of military knives. Throughout the years they have supplied the U.S. military with products such as the M7 bayonet, the USAF Survival Knife, the M1942 Machete, the Navy MK3 MOD 0 diving/survival knife, the M9 bayonet, and most recently, the USMC OKC-3S Bayonet. They have also obtained a contract to build the Aircrew Survival Egress Knife (ASEK) Survival Knife System, chosen by the United States Army {{to be included in}} its Air Warrior Equipment System. The knife was tested and approved by PM Soldier and the United States Army Soldier Systems Center to meet the criteria defined by the US Army, and functions include a Plexiglas <b>breaker,</b> <b>hammer,</b> saw teeth, serrations, spear holes, lanyard hole and insulated guard. The system includes an anodized aluminum strap cutter with replaceable blades, a screwdriver and a honing rod. The sheath also has webbing for attachment to a MOLLE vest.|$|E
50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the grout shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical grout shoe. As the pile is driven the conical grout shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand grout that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The <b>breaker</b> <b>hammer</b> driving tool is fitted with a special grout box adapter to allow the grout to flow from the grout pump through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the grout should slightly exceed the take rate of the grout. In softer soils the grout takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the grout column.|$|E

40|$|The first {{concrete}} pavement in Colorado to be rehabilitated by rubblization was on I- 76 in 1999. Resonant <b>breaker,</b> multi-head <b>hammer</b> and cracking and seating techniques {{were intended to}} fracture the concrete prior to asphalt overlay. Two of the rubblization methods were effective techniques for breaking the existing {{concrete pavement}} to create a base course for the new asphalt concrete overlay. However, some of the concrete slabs contained alkali silica reaction (ASR) and were badly cracked prior to rehabilitation. Although the presence of ASR did not require modification of the resonant <b>breaker</b> or multi-head <b>hammer</b> methods, it did preclude use of cracking and seating because the slabs could not be adequately fractured. The asphalt overlay has no distresses associated with reflective cracking from the old concrete pavement and has not demonstrated any settlement, permanent deformation or other distresses {{as a result of}} the rubblization processes seven years after construction. A falling-weight deflectometer was used to determine deflection in the pavement after five years service and indicated significant increases in asphalt modulus but no change in subgrade modulus. Moisture monitors indicate no accumulation of moisture in the rubblized concrete after five years...|$|R
40|$|Many a {{times the}} semi – {{finished}} products (cocoa butter and cocoa cake) collected from crushed cocoa beans in Nigeria are unacceptable {{in the world}} market due to low quality. Causes in most cases were identified as percentage moisture content before crushing, improper fermentation (slattiness), insect attack, germinated seeds, development of mould and shells in nibs. The quality control department of cocoa processing industries in Nigeria have been trying tried their best to control all the a aforementioned causes of low quality of semi finished products of cocoa beans when crushed and pressed to get cocoa butter and cake except shells in nibs, which is the major cause of making butters and cakes usually unacceptable in the world market. The acceptable level of shell in nibs as recommended by US Food and Drug Administration is 1. 75 %. Experiments were carried out, to know the mechanical factors to be controlled {{in order to bring}} the shells in nibs to an acceptable level of {{less than or equal to}} 1. 75 %. Centrifugal force for breaking the cocoa beans and replacement time for the reflex <b>breakers</b> (<b>hammer</b> the crusher) were found to be major factors. The shell in nibs gradually decreases as the centrifugal force increases. The longer the use of the reflex breakers in the crusher the higher the shells in nibs. Optimum centrifugal force required is 8. 35 N and reflex breakers replacement time is 42 days under intensive crushing process. These brought the percentage of shells in nibs to 1. 15 % which is less than the world acceptable percentage by 0. 6 %. This research recommends the crushing of cocoa beans using centrifugal force of 28. 5...|$|R

60|$|At last, when hope {{had almost}} gone, she reeled in across the smoking Columbia bar one wild morning with her tug ahead, and Jimmy found himself famous {{when he brought}} her safe into harbor. Escaping from the reporters, he went {{off in search of}} coal, and put to sea as soon as he could; but the {{grateful}} captain talked, and the papers made a sensational story of the tow. It appeared that Jimmy had smashed two boats in replacing broken hawsers in a dangerous sea, and had held on to the disabled vessel while she drove up {{to the edge of the}} <b>breakers</b> that <b>hammered</b> a rocky coast. Then a sudden shift of wind saved them, but the next night the collier broke adrift, and he spent two days stubbornly searching for her in the haze and spray. She was in serious peril when he found her, but again he towed her clear, and afterward fought a long, stern fight that seemed bound to be a losing one against the fury of the sea.|$|R
50|$|When {{combined}} with the Wingle's Scrander the Wing Cross, SKL's limiter is released, allowing it to fight at full power, changing its eye color from blue to yellow, as well as unlocking {{a new set of}} weapons, which are variations of those from past Mazingers. The Tornado Crusher Punch is SKL's version of the Turbo Smasher Punch, with the difference being that Ken Kaido is able to guide them to their target after they are deployed. The Breast Triggers fire laser beams as opposed to solid rounds. The Rust Stream is SKL's version of the Rust Tornado from Mazinkaiser. The Thor <b>Hammer</b> <b>Breaker</b> allows SKL to shoot a huge bolt of lightning towards its target from the Ganzantou, similar to Great Mazinger's Thunder Break. Finally, the Inferno Blaster is SKL's most powerful attack, acting similar to the Fire Blaster from Mazinkaiser.|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{injury in}} the hand-arm system from {{vibrating}} hand-held machines {{is one of the}} most common occupational health injuries and causes severe and often chronic nerve and vascular injuries to the operator. The objective with this study is to contribute to reduce hand-arm vibration injuries, first by developing methods of redesigning machines that will lower their vibration level and second to study how high frequency vibrations (HFV) above 1250 Hz effect the finger tissue which are not included in the current standard for risk evaluation. Vibrating hand-held machines can be divided into two main groups depending of the source of the vibration. The first and largest group is machines where a reciprocating piston creates a vibration, e. g. <b>breakers</b> and <b>hammer</b> drills. The second group is rotating machines, e. g. grinders and polishing machines, where the vibration is generated by the unbalance force from the grinding disc or the rotating force from the friction between the abrasive pad and the work piece. This study has mainly been focused on reciprocating machine vibrations by development of a method for attenuation of these vibrations based on tuned vibration absorbers (TVA). The TVA comprises of a spring and an additional mass connected to the main vibrating body that creates a counterforce to attenuate system vibration. The limitation of conventional TVA is that they are only effective in a narrow frequency span and thereby have a limited practical use. However by introducing appropriate gap and spring preload into classical TVA makes the absorber dynamics nonlinear. It was shown that this kind of nonlinearity can lead to frequency auto tuning vibration attenuation. The efficiency of the developed technology called Auto Tuning Vibration Absorber (ATVA) was proven by simulations and the results were validated both in a dedicated test rig as well as in prototype machines. The results from a prototype machine showed that the vibration could be reduced by approx. 80 % and at the same time reduce the weight with 50 % compared to the original machine without affecting the efficiency. The study of the mechanical effects from HFV on finger tissue was made by, first: development of measurement technique based on Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers to be able to accurately measure vibrations up to 50 kHz, second: create a Finite Element (FE) model for simulating the pressure wave propagation into the finger tissue, and third: development of methods to reduce the HFV content in machines. Measurements show that there are high frequency high amplitude accelerations from impact tools and that these accelerations create a pressure wave that propagates into the tissue. It was also shown that there is a large potential to effectively reduce the HFV content in machines. On the study of effects on finger tissue from HFV clearly indicated that there is potentially an increased risk that HFV will cause vibration injuries on humans and on biological tissues and that the current standard ISO  5349 underestimates the associated risks...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD, also known as a dirty bomb) {{it will be necessary to}} remediate the site including building exteriors and interiors, equipment, pavement, vehicles, personal items etc. Remediation will remove or reduce radioactive contamination from the area using a combination of removing and disposing of many assets (including possible demolition of buildings), decontaminating and returning to service other assets, and fixing in place or leaving in place contamination that is deemed 'acceptable'. The later will require setting acceptable dose standards, which will require negotiation with all involved parties and a balance of risk and cost to benefit. To accomplish the first two, disposal or decontamination, a combination of technologies will be deployed that can be loosely classified as: Decontamination; Equipment removal and size reduction; and Demolition. This report will deal only with the decontamination technologies that will be used to return assets to service or to reduce waste disposal. It will not discuss demolition, size reduction or removal technologies or equipment (e. g., backhoe mounted rams, rock splitter, paving <b>breakers</b> and chipping <b>hammers,</b> etc.). As defined by the DOE (1994), decontamination is removal of radiological contamination from the surfaces of facilities and equipment. Expertise in this field comes primarily from the operation and decommissioning of DOE and commercial nuclear facilities as well as a small amount of ongoing research and development closely related to RDD decontamination. Information related to decontamination of fields, buildings, and public spaces resulting from the Goiania and Chernobyl incidents were also reviewed and provide some meaningful insight into decontamination at major urban areas. In order to proceed with decontamination, the item being processed needs to have an intrinsic value that exceeds the cost of the cleaning and justifies the exposure of any workers during the decontamination process(es). In the case of an entire building, the value may be obvious; it's costly to replace the structure. For a smaller item such as a vehicle or painting, the cost versus benefit of decontamination needs to be evaluated. This will be determined on a case by case basis and again is beyond the scope of this report, although some thoughts on decontamination of unique, personal and high value items are given. But, this is clearly an area that starting discussions and negotiations early on will greatly benefit both the economics and timeliness of the clean up. In addition, high value assets might benefit from pre-event protection such as protective coatings or HEPA filtered rooms to prevent contaminated outside air from entering the room (e. g., an art museum) ...|$|R
