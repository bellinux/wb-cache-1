50|$|In the inter-war {{years there}} was much debate over how the French high command should be organised, {{including}} the role and location of GQG. In the years following the deactivation of the First World War's GQG it was planned that any new GQG would have control of only the metropolitan theatre of operations. The structure was to consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commander-in-chief, a major-général and three aide-majors. There were to be four bureaus with different areas of responsibility, much like the GQG of the First World War. The First Bureau dealt with organisation, the Second Bureau with information, the Third Bureau with military operations and the Fourth Bureau with logistics. There would also have been <b>a</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Personnel, <b>a</b> Courier <b>Section,</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> Inspector-Generals and <b>a</b> group composed <b>of</b> units and services particular to GQG. A reorganisation proposal was submitted to Marshal Philippe Pétain (Vice-Chairman of the CSG) in 1928, which sought to reduce the sluggishness and inefficiency within the unit. In 1933 another proposed amendment sought to clarify the commander-in-chiefs powers. It was proposed that {{he would continue to}} have authority over just the metropolitan theatre but would act as an advisor to all other theatres and as a coordinator with any allied forces. However no reforms were implemented.|$|R
