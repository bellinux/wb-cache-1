5|$|Her {{appearances}} {{became more}} regular from July 2014 onwards, with her stepping up her blackmail and revealing Ian's actions to Denise's protective father figure, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). In August 2014, Ian's friend Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, pulled over behind Ian and Rainie {{when he spotted}} them talking. Ian drove off and Rainie approaches Mick, believing {{him to be a}} customer of her prostitute services. The police then pulled up behind Mick, and arrested him for soliciting. When Ian explained Rainie's blackmail, Mick agreed to cover for him, {{to ensure the safety of}} his fake alibi. As a result of this, Rainie was reconciled with her mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), as Cora supported Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) in court before <b>bumping</b> into her daughter. Rainie wants nothing to do with Cora, and pretends the allegations against Mick are true.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for electrical modelling of <b>bump</b> arrays up to a frequency of 30 GHz is presented. It {{starts with the}} development of an equivalent circuit model for a single <b>bump.</b> Based on the radio frequency (RF) modelling of this <b>bump,</b> equivalent circuit models were developed for any two parallel or diagonal <b>bumps,</b> which account for their electromagnetic (EM) interactions. These models were then extended to characterise three-coupled <b>bumps</b> in linear and triangular configurations. For these <b>bump</b> arrangements, it was proven, that considering pitches used in RF and high-speed packages, effects of EM coupling between outwardly-placed <b>bumps</b> on EM interaction between the adjacent ones can be neglected. It is actually on this basis, that a combination of all the electrical models developed can be used to characterise any <b>bump</b> array, irrespective of the number of <b>bumps</b> in the array. This was validated using a <b>bump</b> array consisting of four-coupled <b>bumps...</b>|$|R
50|$|The elbow <b>bump</b> as a {{greeting}} is also attributed to be a derivative {{of the more}} well known fist <b>bump,</b> beginning in the 1980s. The earliest written record of the elbow <b>bump</b> by David Grimes supports this hypothesis.

5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or <b>bumping</b> into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by <b>bumping</b> into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if more than one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E
5|$|The Washington State Legislature {{created the}} State Highway Board in 1905 and {{appropriated}} funds to construct—but not maintain—twelve highways in sparsely settled {{areas of the}} state. Main highways in more populated areas {{would continue to be}} entirely under county control, though sometimes built with 50% state aid. Six of these highways were east-west crossings of the Cascades, including one in the corridor currently served by U.S. Route 12—State Road 5, the Cowlitz Pass State Road, climbing east from a point near Salkum via the Cowlitz River, over Cowlitz Pass, and down towards Yakima. A 1907 amendment renamed State Road 5 the Cowlitz-Natches Road, moved the Cascade crossing north to Carlton Pass, and defined the portion east of the pass to follow the <b>Bumping</b> River and Naches River to a point near Naches. East of the mouth of the American River, this replaced part of State Road 1 (North Yakima and Natches State Road), which had been defined in 1897 to cross the Cascades north of Chinook Pass and included in the 1905 appropriations.|$|E
40|$|IUE {{data are}} used to {{investigate}} {{the properties of the}} 2175 A interstellar extinction <b>bump</b> toward 45 reddened Milky Way stars. Using analytic fitting functions, parameters are derived which describe the central position, FWHM, and strength of the <b>bump.</b> The <b>bump</b> position is very stable, with an extreme deviation which is still significantly larger than the measurement uncertainty, indicating true variability. The <b>bump</b> FWHM has a large range of intrinsic values, 0. 77 /micron to 1. 25 /micron. The normalized <b>bump</b> strength varies by more than a factor of three. There are no convincing correlations among the three <b>bump</b> parameters, but the width of the <b>bump</b> is strongly correlated with the dust grain environments. Dense quiescent regions yield broad <b>bumps,</b> while diffuse interstellar medium and regions of recent star formation yield narrower <b>bumps.</b> The absence of any correlation between <b>bump</b> width and central position argues strongly against graphite grains in the size range prescribed by the Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck (1977) model as carriers of the <b>bump...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including <b>bumping,</b> chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E

As the music begins {{and the scene}} shifts to another where Carey applying her eye make-up and earrings. As a form of product placement, her fragrance is shown on a dresser in her Boudoir. As Carey finishes getting ready, scenery of Las Vegas is shown, before shifting to Carey, now dressed as a Vegas performer. As she walks down a runway dressed in white garments ad feathers, she catches {{the attention of a}} man. He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in turn came to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, <b>bumping</b> into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her into the passengers seat, and pulls over the car, continuing the scene {{from the beginning of the}} video. After the car explodes, Carey tears off her necklace in despair, and begins to flail her arms in desperation. The video ends with Carey back at the show in Vegas during the finale, as glitter drops from the top of the stage. Carey, now back in the desert, looks for another ride, and gets into a black Cadillac Escalade driven by Nick Cannon.|$|E

40|$|An {{extended}} tail or prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA) {{follows the}} receptor {{potential of a}} locust retinula cell when the stimulating light is in the intensity range that saturates the receptor potential. The amplitude and duration of this afterpotential depend on the intensity and duration of the stimulus.

As previously demonstrated, LID <b>bumps</b> are indistinguishable from <b>bumps</b> directly induced by low intensity light in light-adapted cells, which in turn grade into the slightly larger <b>bumps</b> produced, each by a single photon, in dark-adapted cells. The light-induced dark <b>bumps</b> continue for up to an hour in darkness, slowly becoming like dark-adapted <b>bumps</b> in amplitude and shape.
