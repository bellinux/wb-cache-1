5|$|At compile time, the {{interpreter}} parses Perl code into a syntax tree. At run time, it executes the program <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> the tree. Text is parsed only once, and the syntax tree {{is subject to}} optimization before it is executed, so that execution is relatively efficient. Compile-time optimizations on the syntax tree include constant folding and context propagation, but peephole optimization is also performed.|$|E
5|$|Built {{from its}} {{earliest}} nucleus outward, and having escaped {{much of the}} destruction endured by Poland during the 20th-century wars, Kraków's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> from the city centre out, towards its later districts. Kraków {{is one of the}} few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic Ratusz town hall in its Main Square, because it has not survived the Partitions of Poland.|$|E

30|$|Based on conserved {{motif of}} certain enzymes, {{chromosome}} walking provided a new method to identify functional enzymes [44]. A functional P 450 monooxygenase from Rhodococcus sp. ECU 0066 was identified <b>by</b> chromosome <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> several rounds of PCR, with capability in the enantioselective oxidation of sulfides [45].|$|R
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources <b>by</b> <b>walking.</b> One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
5|$|Lamont {{is married}} to Archie Graham, deputy leader of Glasgow City Council and Labour {{councillor}} for Langside ward. They have two children. She {{is a fan of}} the television soap Coronation Street and likes to keep fit <b>by</b> <b>walking,</b> jogging and dancing. As a keen runner, she has completed several long distance races.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} <b>by</b> <b>walking,</b> {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E

5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of a man or, more often, {{a woman who is}} challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within a limited amount of time. This motif is attested by Livy around 1 CE, 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, and in folktales from Northern Europe. In six tales from Jutland, Denmark and one from Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though the conditions are often met <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> or riding.|$|E
5|$|Bok finally {{escaped from}} Giemma {{when he was}} 17 years old <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police {{department}} to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind as {{he walked into the}} crowded marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the {{container}} terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan are unclear, but redbacks {{are thought to have}} spread <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E
5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E
5|$|Madgwick officially {{took office}} on 1 July 1967. As chairman, Madgwick took a {{somewhat}} hands-off approach to directing the organisation, preferring to provide his opinion {{as to how}} things should operate, then deferring to his administrators {{to decide what to}} do. Madgwick considered his position as similar to a university president, with managers and producers equivalent to professors and researchers. He bought a home in Mosman to be closer to the ABC's main Broadcast House in Sydney. Madgwick tried to make himself available <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> around the offices and facilities and amiably conversing with all ABC employees. He was subsequently described as the most popular chairman {{in the history of the}} organisation. Madgwick was given a second term as chairman in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{opened the}} 2010 season {{at home against}} the Connecticut Huskies, the first ever meeting between the two schools. Michigan celebrated the re-dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special flyover by a World War II era B-25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township, and then another flyover {{immediately}} following the national anthem by two A-10 aircraft. Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> to the banner and touching it, which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd. Elliot Mealer had only recently regained the ability to walk following injuries in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|Minoru Yasui {{was born}} in 1916 in Hood River, Oregon, where he {{graduated}} from high school in 1933. He then graduated from the University of Oregon in 1937, and that college’s law school in 1939. Yasui, U.S. Army reservist, then began working at the Japanese Consulate in Chicago, Illinois, in 1940, remaining there until December 8, 1941, when he then resigned and returned to Hood River. On March 28, 1942, he deliberately broke the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon, <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew’s constitutionality.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2015, Phillies {{left-hander}} Cole Hamels {{threw his}} first career no-hitter in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Cubs at the historic Wrigley Field. He narrowly missed completing a perfect game <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> two Cubs batters. Odubel Herrera, Phillies centerfielder, nearly dropped the game's final out at the warning track after he overran a long fly ball hit by Cubs rookie sensation Kris Bryant; Herrera, however, was able to snag the ball with an awkward sliding catch to close out the game and preserve Hamels's no-hitter. In addition to this being Cole Hamels's first no-hitter, this was the fourth no hitter caught by longtime Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, who now has tied the MLB record for no-hitters caught.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, 1984, LeDuc {{teamed with}} former kayfabe rival Jerry Lawler {{to win the}} AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from Elijah Akeem and Kareem Muhammad. In a six-man match the {{following}} week, LeDuc teamed with Lawler and Jimmy Hart, who was their manager but wrestled on occasion. During the match, LeDuc revealed that his reconciliation with Lawler was a setup, as LeDuc and Hart turned on Lawler <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> away to leave Lawler by himself. As a result, the tag team title was vacated and the feud was rekindled.|$|E
5|$|The City of Gretna on the West Bank of the Mississippi River {{received}} considerable {{press coverage}} when, {{in the aftermath}} of Hurricane Katrina (late August 2005), displaced and dehydrated survivors who attempted to escape from New Orleans <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> over the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's deputies, who set up a roadblock on the bridge in the days following the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{advanced}} {{north and}} west from Kladanj towards a cordon established by ten Croatian Home Guard battalions supported by their own artillery. The Germans believed they had thoroughly sealed off the area, and checked the Croatian cordon every night, {{but the majority of}} Partisans were able to evade the cordon and escape by breaking up into small groups and infiltrating through the cordon through seemingly impassable terrain. The Germans also believed that some Partisans merely withdrew into the mountains, concealing their numbers <b>by</b> <b>walking</b> in each other's snowprints, in order to return to the valleys when the Axis forces left. The operation concluded on 4 February 1942.|$|E
