The current dependence of the voltage noise shows a strong asymmetry between the forward and <b>backward</b> <b>current</b> ramping and a discontinuous change of the noise close to its measured maximum occurring at the switching current. We show that both the large hysteresis and the voltage noise anomaly in this current-biased setup are a consequence of the influence of junction's electromagnetic environment. Typically, the voltage-noise dependence on the junction current parametrized by the external drive contains a loop which is, however, not observed experimentally because of the implementation of the junction-current ramp.

Therefore, the fundamental solution sustains up {{to a very}} high current level during the forward current sweeping. In the contrary, for the <b>backward</b> <b>current</b> sweepings, initial excitations with multiple pulses co-existing in the cavity are exploited, so the harmonic ML appears {{from the very beginning}} of the sweeping and holds until a current level where it is no longer a solution for the considered device. While in real experiments, due to the unavoidable spontaneous emission, automatic jump to harmonic ML at the onset current of the multistable regime should be expected when forward sweeps the injection current. In this study, we tried also the backward sweeping using initial excitations with five or even more co-existing pulses in one round trip time. In these kinds of situations, fast relaxation to the fourth harmonic ML is observed when numerical convergence was achieved. This fact indicates that, within the investigated current range, the relative relationship between the round trip time and the recovery times of gain and absorption could support, to the largest, four pulses co-existing in the laser cavity.|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} modeling approaches and algorithms for the simulation of high-voltage transmission networks with {{various degrees of}} accuracy and computational complexity. For the simulation of switching transients, the so-called Bergeron model {{is perhaps the most}} widely used approach as implemented in the renowned Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). Therein, the transmission line is represented as forward and <b>backward</b> <b>current</b> waves implemented using standard queues with purely algebraic boundary equations. This representation is very efficient for the calculation of switching transients; however, it is inherently a fixed-time-step approach that is not conducive to the study of longer-term transient and dynamical phenomena such as the inter-area inertial oscillations that occur following major disturbances and can lead to transient instabilities. This restriction has led to a completely separate class of computer programs, i. e. transient stability programs, in which electromagnetic transients are completely neglected. In this thesis, a new transmission line modeling structure is set forth that is able to accurately portray the high-frequency switching transients but has a dynamically changing order and structure so that, after the fast switching transients subside, the lower-frequency phenomena can be simulated using a much larger and variable time step. It is argued that the resulting transmission line structure accurately portrays switching transients and, concurrently, is much more efficient than the Bergeron model when simulating long-term transients. The significance of the proposed transmission line modeling structure is that it obviates the need for separate computer programs that focus on specific time frames. ...|$|E

40|$|Phenomenological {{approach}} is developed {{in the theory of}} spin-valve type ferromagnetic junctions to describe exchange switching by current flowing perpendicular to interfaces. Forward and <b>backward</b> <b>current</b> switching effects are described and they may be principally different in nature. Mobile electron spins are considered as being free in all the contacting ferromagnetic layers. Joint action of the following two current effects is investigated: the nonequilibrium longitudinal spin-injection effective field and the transverse spin-transfer surface torque. Dispersion relation for fluctuations is derived and solved for a junction model having spatially localized spin transfer torque: depth of the torque penetration into the free layer is assumed much smaller than the total free layer thickness. Some critical value of the well known Gilbert damping constant is established for the first time. Spin transfer torque dominates in the instability threshold determination for small enough damping constants, while the spin-injection effective field dominates for high damping. Fine interplay between spin transfer torque and spin injection is necessary to provide a hysteretic behavior of the resistance versus current dependence. The state diagram building up shows the possibility of non-stationary (time dependent) nonlinear states arising due to instability development. Calculations lead to the instability rise time values of the order of 0. 1 ns. Spin wave resonance frequency spectrum softening occurs under the current growing to the instability threshold. Magnetization fluctuations above the threshold rise oscillating with time for low damping, but rise aperiodically and much more rapid for high damping. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures. Corrected typos.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the multi-scale {{modeling}} of electron and spin transport in graphene-based nanodevices. Several devices with fascinating structures and attractive properties have been designed by means of state-of-the-art computational methods, which include ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the geometry, density functional theory (DFT) for the electronic structure, and non-equilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF) for carriers transport properties. Poly-crystalline graphenes offer ample opportunities to make devices with desirable properties. We have systematically studied a type of poly-crystalline graphene constructed by zigzag and armchair graphene nanoribbons (ZGNR and AGNR). It is found that the choice of the supercells in modeling with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) has strong implications on the electronic and magnetic properties of such hybrid systems. A model with minimal lattice mismatch is obtained, which could be regarded as the most appropriate model for hybrid GNRs. With this model, it is revealed that the hybrid GNR is of ferromagnetism with a high Curie temperature. We have then designed armchair/zigzag graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions (AGNR|ZGNR) with a well-defined conductance oscillation and rectification behavior. It is shown that the resonance or nonresonance of the frontier orbitals between AGNR and ZGNR {{is the source of the}} oscillation and the asymmetric structure is the root of the rectification. A high rectification ratio can be achieved by tuning the width of ZGNR to enhance the asymmetric character of transmission function and to minimize the <b>backward</b> <b>current.</b> The electron transport properties of graphene can be modified by hydrogenation strips (HSs) formed from the absorbed hydrogen atoms. We have designed a new graphene nanoribbon that has zigzag-edged HSs placed at its middle region. It is found that the HS can electrically separate the GNR into sub-GNRs and each HS introduces two spin-polarized conducting edge-like states around the Fermi level. This leads to a significant enhancement of the conductance and the spinpolarization. We have also found that by introducing embedding a short sp 3 -edged section into the sp 2 -edged ZGNRs or a short sp 2 -edged section into the sp 3 -edged ZGNRs, the orbital symmetry mismatch between these two sections can induce the opening of the conductance energy gap in ZGNRs over a wide energy region. This simple strategy explains many unexplained experimental results and offers a simple strategy to design GNRs with a proper energy gap. We have also carefully examined the spin-polarization of chiral GNRs with reconstructed (2, 1) -edges. It is found that the unsaturated (2, 1) -edged chiral GNRs can possess strong current polarizations (nearly 100 %) and a striking negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior.
