500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|California was {{produced}} by John Feldmann and recorded at his studio, Foxy Studios, in Woodland Hills, California between January and March 2016. Feldmann, initially the frontman of the band Goldfinger, became better known for his production work with artists such as 5 Seconds of Summer and All Time Low. Barker {{was the first to}} reach out to Feldmann about producing, as the two were good friends. He had known the members of Blink-182 for over two decades, as the group had previously performed shows with Goldfinger. He is the first new producer to work with Blink-182 since the death of the band's longtime producer, Jerry Finn, who last worked with the band in 2003. Feldmann [...] "worshipped" [...] Finn and his approach to producing. [...] "I never thought there'd <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> that could come even close to replacing Jerry, and John is really the closest that we've come to someone who could fill that capacity," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E
2500|$|The 256th couplet of Tirukkural, {{which was}} {{composed}} at least 2000 years ago, says that [...] "if {{people do not}} consume a product or service, then there will not <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> to supply that product or service {{for the sake of}} price".|$|E

2500|$|Over 1,000 {{people turned}} up to Powell's funeral {{and during the}} {{ceremony}} he was hailed {{as a man of}} prophecy, political sacrifice and as a great parliamentarian. During the mass, Lord Biffen stated that Powell's nationalism [...] "certainly did not bear the stamp of racial superiority or xenophobia". After Powell's death many Conservative politicians paid tribute to him, including former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who stated [...] "There will never <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> else so compelling as Enoch Powell. He was magnetic. Listening to his speeches was an unforgettable privilege. He was one of those rare people who made a difference and whose moral compass led us in the right direction." [...] Other politicians, including his rivals, also paid tribute to him, including former Labour party leader Tony Blair who said [...] "However controversial his views, {{he was one of the}} great figures of 20th-century British politics, gifted with a brilliant mind. However much we disagreed with many of his views, there was no doubting the strength of his convictions or their sincerity, or his tenacity in pursuing them, regardless of his own political self-interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Attempts {{to find a}} local buyer were unsuccessful, with league {{commissioner}} Gary Bettman saying, [...] "there doesn't seem to <b>be</b> <b>anybody,</b> in {{a serious}} fashion, who wants to own the franchise." [...] After an eleventh-hour effort {{by a team of}} local businessmen, dubbed the Spirit of Manitoba, fell through, team owner Barry Shenkarow sold the team to American businessmen Steven Gluckstern and Richard Burke. Burke and Gluckstern originally planned to move the team to Minnesota (which had lost the North Stars to Dallas in 1993), but when negotiations for a lease agreement with the landlords of the Target Center fell through, the new owners eventually reached an agreement with Phoenix businessman Jerry Colangelo that saw the team move to Arizona and become the Phoenix Coyotes. [...] The Winnipeg Jets played their last-ever game on April 28, 1996, a home playoff loss to the Detroit Red Wings by a score of 4â€“1. Norm Maciver scored the last goal in Jets history. [...] Winnipeg was not without hockey for long, however; the International Hockey League's Minnesota Moose moved to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose a few months after it was announced that the Jets were leaving town. The team later joined the American Hockey League as the affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks when the IHL collapsed.|$|E
