25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th {{state in the}} Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's <b>boundary</b> <b>issues</b> resolved, {{and most of its}} land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.|$|E
25|$|Three major {{types of}} issues were {{addressed}} by the Compromise of 1850: a variety of <b>boundary</b> <b>issues,</b> the status of territory issues, {{and the issue of}} slavery. While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were actually included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of wars followed from 1858 to 1868 between the Basotho kingdom and the Boer republic of Orange Free State. In the battles that followed, the Orange Free State {{tried unsuccessfully to}} capture Moshoeshoe's mountain stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, while the Sotho conducted raids in Free State territories. Both sides adopted scorched-earth tactics, with large swathes of pasturage and cropland being destroyed. Faced with starvation, Moshoeshoe signed a peace treaty on 15 October 1858, though crucial <b>boundary</b> <b>issues</b> remained unresolved. War broke out again in 1865. After an unsuccessful appeal for aid from the British Empire, Moshoeshoe signed the 1866 treaty of Thaba Bosiu, with the Basotho ceding substantial territory to the Orange Free State. On 12 March 1868, the British parliament declared the Basotho Kingdom a British protectorate {{and part of the}} British Empire. Open hostilities ceased between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. The country was subsequently named Basutoland and is presently named Lesotho.|$|E

500|$|Clarke wrote a {{particularly}} eloquent proposal in a petition {{received by the}} crown on 5 February 1661, with certain words emboldened within the document. [...] His earnest request was [...] "TO HOLD FORTH A LIVELY EXPERIMENT THAT A MOST FLOURISHING CIVILL STATE MAY STAND… AND BEST BE MAINTAYNED… WITH A FULL LIBERTIE IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNMENTS". [...] These words became emblematic of Rhode Island's struggle for religious freedom and were soon included in the charter itself—and much later were chiseled on the frieze of the Rhode Island State House.

500|$|Jay was {{instructed}} by Alexander Hamilton to seek compensation for seizure of American ships and {{to clarify the}} rules governing British seizure of neutral ships. He was also {{to insist that the}} British relinquish their posts in the Northwest. In return, the U.S. would take responsibility for pre-Revolution debts owed to British merchants and subjects. He also asked Jay, if possible, to seek limited access for American ships to the British West Indies. Jay and the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Grenville, began negotiations on July 30, 1794. The treaty that emerged several weeks later, commonly known as the Jay Treaty, was, in Jay's words [...] "equal and fair." [...] Both sides achieved many objectives; several issues were sent to arbitration. For the British, America remained neutral and economically grew closer to Britain. The Americans also guaranteed favorable treatment to British imports. In return, the British agreed to evacuate the western forts, which they had been supposed to do by 1783. They also agreed to open their West Indies ports to smaller American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies, and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships, and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. However, the treaty contained neither concessions on impressment nor statement of rights for American sailors. Another commission was later established to settle <b>boundary</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

[...] In the Texas Revolution (1835–36), the settlers declared independence and defeated the Mexican army, but Mexico was determined to reconquer the lost province and threatened war with the U.S. if it annexed Texas.

500|$|Belcher {{was unwilling}} to resolve longstanding {{boundary}} disputes between New Hampshire and Massachusetts. [...] The disputed territory included areas west of the Merrimack River from its great bend near present-day Chelmsford, Massachusetts to present-day Concord, New Hampshire. [...] Competing grantees from the two provinces were by the 1730s engaging in increasingly tense legal action and petty violence against each other. [...] Despite claims that he was neutral on the matter, Belcher orchestrated affairs to prefer the settlement of lands north and west of the Merrimack River by Massachusetts residents. [...] The dispute eventually reached {{the highest levels of}} government and court in England. [...] New Hampshire's advocates for separation from Massachusetts found an able spokesman in John Thomlinson, a London merchant with logging interests, who in 1737 convinced the Board of Trade to establish a commission on the <b>boundary</b> <b>issue.</b> [...] Despite Belcher's attempts to orchestrate legislative proceedings to the advantage of Massachusetts (for example, allowing the New Hampshire assembly only one day to prepare a case on the dispute while that of Massachusetts had several months), the final ruling on the <b>boundary,</b> <b>issued</b> in 1739, went significantly in New Hampshire's favor.|$|R

40|$|This study argues the {{relevance}} of the delimitation debate which has existed for over half a century. The study will show that a legally accepted boundary between air space and outer space would effectively close the existing gap within air and space law which has led to uncertain legal application over space activities. Technology changes in aircraft, spacecraft, combined with the growth of space activity, creates a sense of urgency to have the <b>boundary</b> <b>issue</b> resolved, a situation different from {{the early days of the}} space era when it was assumed that a boundary would be defined at a future indeterminate date. This study will examine the legal regime governing airspace and outer space and the growing pressures on questions of sovereignty resulting from the unknown delimitation line. To be followed by a background study of the delimitation debate, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches furnished in light of the emerging space technologies and space activities. The urgency to resolve the delimitation debate is put into context, by a discussion of the legal significance of the <b>boundary</b> <b>issue</b> in respect of problems arising in space activities and the regulation of space activities.
