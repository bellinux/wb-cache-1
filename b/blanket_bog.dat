5|$|Over the {{lifetime}} of the wind farm, Peel Holdings' energy subsidiary, Peel Wind Power Ltd, will provide up to £500,000 to help landowners create biodiverse areas on the land surrounding the moor. A prime target habitat envisaged to be enhanced and re-created under the Habitat Enhancement Plan is upland <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> and important habitats for skylarks and wading birds on the moorland fringe. To receive funding, landowners within an identified area will need to apply to a panel made up of representatives from Peel, the local authorities and independent ecological experts.

5|$|The trail follows forest tracks, {{mountain}} paths, boreens {{and quiet}} country roads. Mountains, upland lakes and steep-sided glacial valleys {{make up the}} terrain of the initial northern sections of the Way before giving way to gentler rolling foothills in the latter southern sections. Much of the route follows the contact point between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland, heath and <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{enjoys a}} {{diversity}} of temperate ecologies, incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and moorland, montane, estuarine, freshwater, oceanic, and tundra landscapes. Approximately 14% of Scotland is wooded, much of it forestry plantations, but prior to human clearing {{there would have been}} much larger areas of boreal Caledonian and broad-leaved forest. Although much reduced, significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands can be found in places. 17% of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and peatland. Caithness and Sutherland have some {{of the largest and most}} intact areas of <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> in the world, supporting a distinctive wildlife community. 75% of Scotland's land is classed as agricultural (including some moorland) with urban areas accounting for around 3% of the total. The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800, about 600 of them lying off the west coast. Scotland has more than 90% of the volume and 70% of the total surface area of fresh water in the United Kingdom. There are more than 30,000 freshwater lochs and 6,600 river systems.|$|E

5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Coan Bogs {{was defined}} as a Natural Heritage Area under section 18 of the Wildlife Act 2000. The <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> {{consists}} of two small areas of upland <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> located near Castlecomer in the townlands of Coan East and Smithstown. Bedrock geology for both areas is shale overlain locally by glacial till and <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> vegetation is well developed.|$|E
25|$|Caithness {{is a land}} of open, rolling farmland, moorland and {{scattered}} settlements. The area is fringed {{to the north and}} east by dramatic coastal scenery and is home to large, internationally important colonies of seabirds. The surrounding waters of the Pentland Firth and the North Sea hold a great diversity of marine life. Away from the coast, the landscape is dominated by open moorland and <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> known as the Flow Country which is the largest expanse of <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> in Europe, extending into Sutherland.

40|$|Aims to {{describe}} the variation in breeding bird populations that occur on different types of Irish peatlands and their associated habitat characteristics. Methods: Bird abundance and diversity were compared between four peatland habitat types: fens; raised bogs; Atlantic blanket bogs; and montane <b>blanket</b> <b>bogs</b> at twelve study sites using transects. Various measures of habitat quality were also taken at each location. Results: Only 21 species were recorded during the study with Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis and Sky Lark Alauda arvensis accounting for over 80 % of all birds recorded. Fens had greater bird species diversity and densities than the other three peatland types. Raised <b>bogs,</b> Atlantic <b>blanket</b> <b>bogs</b> and montane <b>blanket</b> <b>bogs</b> were very similar {{in terms of their}} avian diversity. Each of the recorded bird species were associated with different aspects of the peatland habitat. Conclusion: This study shows that despite the relatively low avian species diversity of Irish peatlands, they are of enormous conservation value due to the presence of species of high conservation concern such as Red Grouse (Willow Ptarmigan) Lagopus lagopus and Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blanket</b> <b>bogs</b> are a {{globally}} rare {{habitat and}} store {{vast quantities of}} carbon {{in the form of}} peat. In the UK, <b>blanket</b> <b>bogs</b> are subject to a variety of anthropogenic activities which threaten their ability to maintain this carbon store long term. Release of this carbon is likely to exacerbate climate change. Burning peatlands to encourage Calluna vulgaris on grouse moors is thought to be detrimental to peat-forming vegetation, water quality and the peatland carbon balance but lacks robust evidence. This study aimed to assess the effects of different methods of Calluna management on the carbon balance, vegetation dynamics and water quality of <b>blanket</b> <b>bogs.</b> A paired catchment manipulation was combined with plot-scale manipulations and replicated across three English <b>blanket</b> <b>bogs</b> managed as grouse moors {{to examine the effects of}} burning, mowing, no management and variations thereof on the carbon balance and vegetation changes. Carbon balances indicated that unmanaged areas were a carbon sink whereas both burning and mowing caused carbon release. Taking the quantities of burnt plant biomass and tractor fuel into account, burnt areas were a stronger carbon source than mown areas. Mowing increased both height and cover of Calluna compared to burning, promoted growth of Eriophorum vaginatum, a peat-forming species, and had less bare ground. The nutritional content of Calluna increased under management, being slightly higher following burning than mowing. A pot experiment was combined with radiocarbon analysis to explore whether Calluna-associated ericoid fungi break down recalcitrant matter in the peat. The radiocarbon dates strongly indicated that ericoid fungi decomposed recalcitrant ancient compounds within the peat, releasing these as gaseous and aquatic carbon. Altering Calluna management practices by replacing burning with mowing, where feasible, could potentially bring benefits for the peatland carbon balance and water quality by increasing abundance of peat-forming species without negatively impacting upon grouse...|$|R

25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{this is one}} of the commonest pondweeds, {{occurring}} in almost any wet or semi-wet oligotrophic and / or acidic habitat so long as flow is not too rapid. It may be found in lakes, slow-flowing rivers, ponds, ditches, seeps and among bog mosses (Sphagnum). As its name suggests, it is common in areas of <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> but may also occur in secondary habitats such as unshaded drainage ditches in bogs and forest plantations. In British rivers it typically grows with other soft-water species such as Ranunculus flammula, Carex nigra, C. rostrata, Scapania undulata and Equisetum fluviatile. In lakes it tends to occur in base-poor, oligotrophic waters with species such as Littorella uniflora, Sphagnum spp., Lobelia dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris especially with a peaty substrate.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the first {{settlers}} in Ireland about 9,000 years ago, the land was largely covered by forests of oak, ash, elm, hazel, yew, and other native trees. The growth of <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> and the extensive clearing of woodland to facilitate farming are believed to be the main causes of deforestation during the following centuries. Today, about 12% of Ireland is forested, of which a significant majority is composed of mainly non-native coniferous plantations for commercial use. Ideal soil conditions, high rainfall and a mild climate give Ireland the highest growth rates for forests in Europe. Hedgerows, which are traditionally used to define land boundaries, are an important substitute for woodland habitat, providing refuge for native wild flora and a wide range of insect, bird and mammal species.|$|E
500|$|The gritstone and shale of the Dark Peak {{supports}} heather moorland and <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> environments, with rough sheep {{pasture and}} grouse shooting being the main land uses. The limestone plateaux of the White Peak are more intensively farmed, with mainly dairy usage of improved pastures. The gritstone {{landscape of the}} South West Peak also supports moorland environments although the landscape supports both farming and grouse shooting. Woodland forms around 8% of the Peak National Park. Natural broad-leaved woodland {{is found in the}} steep-sided, narrow dales of the White Peak and the deep cloughs of the Dark Peak and South West Peak, while reservoir margins often have coniferous plantations.|$|E
25|$|Muckross Lake and the Upper Lake {{are high}} quality {{oligotrophic}} systems, with {{water that is}} slightly acidic and low in nutrients.

500|$|Ireland has 12,000km² (4,633miles²) of bogland, {{consisting}} of two distinct types, blanket bogs and raised bogs. Blanket bogs are the more widespread of the two types. They are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate. Blanket bogs formed on sites where Neolithic farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began to leach and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment {{for the growth of}} heather and rushes.

Crossing the river at a footbridge, the trail then passes into Crone Woods and ascends to Ride Rock, which overlooks Powerscourt Deerpark and the Powerscourt Waterfall, the tallest in Ireland at [...] Deer – hybrids of imported Japanese Sika and native Red deer – are common in the forests and mountains along the Wicklow Way and all deer in the Wicklow Mountains originated with the Powerscourt herd. The next valley to be crossed is Glensoulan which, although uninhabited today, before the Great Famine of the 1840s was home to a small population of cottiers and faint traces of their farms can still be seen in the wintertime when the bracken is low. Crossing the River Dargle, the trail ascends the eastern shoulder of Djouce mountain. Here, the heathland gives way to wetter <b>blanket</b> <b>bog.</b> Bogland shares a number of plant and animal species with heathland but is also a habitat for species of bog cotton as well as bog asphodel, sedges (which contribute to the formation of peat) and bog moss.
