5|$|Both the East Riding and Hull {{are still}} {{covered by the}} Humberside Police area and the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. Piped water is {{supplied}} by Yorkshire Water who also maintain the sewerage system. About 1% of the population use water from private supplies. They are usually in the more remote parts of the East Riding. The majority are bore holes <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> wells or natural springs.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are usually}} grilled, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often grilled {{in an attempt}} to {{replicate}} the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.|$|E
5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture {{with water and}} are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, {{the source of}} nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen {{is available in the}} soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} breed {{clubs in the}} UK {{supporting}} the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly but tough and is suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed specific health concerns, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following {{a celebration of the}} Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme {{on the basis of a}} two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognised sports that have never been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, including chess and surfing.|$|E

5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> aggressive with other dogs {{to try to}} prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but they can become dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys {{can be an effective}} tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on}} the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E
5|$|Z. ferox is {{only known}} from small, {{wingless}} females. The head {{is similar to}} those of queens of Z. tonsora, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex. Only a single row of denticles is present, and the vertexal margin (seen posterodorsally) is concave. The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, fovea (a pit or depression in a structure) or carina (a keel-like elevation on the body-wall of an insect). The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave; it is high and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs (the largest region of an insect's leg) and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both anteriorly and posteriorly. The gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) has five known segments. Like the queen, Z. ferox has a large, retractable stinger, in which the external part is enclosed by the gonostyli (sting sheaths).|$|E

25|$|Serpulids and sabellids are two {{families}} of the Sabellida suborder of Canalipalpata tubeworms that are similar in nearly every respect, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> readily distinguished {{by the fact that}} while both have radioles, the sabellids (such as Sabella pavonina) lack an operculum.|$|E
25|$|Broad beans (Spanish: habas) {{are widely}} {{cultivated}} in Spain. Culinary uses vary among regions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used as the}} main pulse in a stew (Favetes, habas estofadas, michirones) or as an addition to other dishes (menestra, paella). In certain regions they can be eaten while unripe or fried and packaged as a snack.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{the spin}} {{representations}} are particular projective {{representations of the}} orthogonal or special orthogonal groups in arbitrary dimension and signature (i.e., including indefinite orthogonal groups). More precisely, they are representations of the spin groups, which are double covers of the special orthogonal groups. They are usually studied over the real or complex numbers, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> defined over other fields.|$|E
25|$|American house spiders are {{generally}} dull brown in coloration, with patterns of differing shades often giving a vaguely spotted appearance (particularly noticeable on the legs). Their average body size is a quarter-inch (6mm) long, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> an inch (2.5cm) or more across with legs outspread. Their size and coloration allow the spiders to {{blend into the}} background and escape notice.|$|E
25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a hot end and a cold end, containing a power piston and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
