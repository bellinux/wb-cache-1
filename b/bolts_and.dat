40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} of vegetative growth to <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering {{is an important}} process in {{the life cycle of}} plants, which is determined by numerous genes forming an intricate network of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering. However, no comprehensive identification <b>and</b> profiling of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering-related genes have been carried out in radish. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to analyze the differential gene expressions during the transition from vegetative stage to reproductive stage in radish. A total of 5, 922 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 779 up-regulated and 5, 143 down-regulated genes were isolated. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that some DEGs were involved in hormone signaling pathways and the transcriptional regulation of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering. KEGG-based analysis identified 37 DEGs being involved in phytohormone signaling pathways. Moreover, 95 DEGs related to <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering were identified and integrated into various flowering pathways. Several critical genes including FT, CO, SOC 1, FLC and LFY were characterized and profiled by RT-qPCR analysis. Correlation analysis indicated that 24 miRNA-DEG pairs were involved in radish <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering. Finally, a miRNA-DEG-based schematic model of <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering regulatory network was proposed in radish. These outcomes provided significant insights into genetic control of radish <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering, and would facilitate unraveling molecular regulatory mechanism underlying <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> flowering in root vegetable crops...|$|R

Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. <b>Bolts</b> <b>and</b> parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E

30|$|If {{a single}} support type cannot {{effectively}} control the roadway deformation, combined support method, i.e. {{the combination of}} two or more support types are used, which is an alternative for roadways at depth and under complex conditions. There are various combined supports, such as rock <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> grouting, rock <b>bolting</b> <b>and</b> steel supports, steel supports <b>and</b> grouting, rock <b>bolting</b> with grouting <b>and</b> steel supports. If only the advantages of each support method are fully exerted, and different support methods compensate each other, good support performance can be realized.

In March 1944, after about five months' convalescence, he was passed fit for flying. He turned down the offer of a posting home to Southern Rhodesia as an instructor and, after a refresher course in Egypt, travelled to Corsica to rejoin No. 237 Squadron, which was by now flying Spitfire Mk IXs.|$|E
5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's province while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> the compasses.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor <b>bolts,</b> <b>and</b> that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|The single-player {{adventure}} {{begins by}} personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. While the algorithm stays the same, the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player {{begins with a}} sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see his immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning <b>bolts,</b> <b>and</b> turning the undead, as well as health regeneration and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned by trial and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.|$|E
