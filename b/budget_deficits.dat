5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> is inflationary or not in Nigeria within {{the period of}} 1980 - 2009. The study made use of time series data and employed vector Error correction Mechanism (VECM) to determine the correlation that existed between the two macroeconomic variables. The study also investigated the existence of long run relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and inflation. The result showed a significant causal relationship from <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to inflation while the causal relationship from inflation to <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> was insignificant. This implies that a uni-directional causality from <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to inflation exist in Nigeria.

5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).

Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election.

5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E

30|$|According to Olivera–Tanzi effect, {{the nexus}} between <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and {{inflation}} exhibits a two-way interaction. That is, {{not only does}} the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> through its impact on money aggregates and expectations produces inflationary pressures, but high inflation also has a feedback effect pushing up the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b> Basically, the process works due to significant lags in tax collections. The problem {{lies in the fact that}} the time of tax obligation’s accrual and the time of actual tax payment do not coincide, with the payment usually made at a later date. We may therefore have the following self-strengthening phenomenon. Persistence of <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> props inflation which in turn lowers real tax revenues, a fall in the real tax revenue then necessitates and further increases in the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and so on. In economic literature, this is referred to as the ‘Olivera–Tanzi effect’ (Olivera 1967).|$|R
30|$|In Uganda, however, less {{effort has}} been made to study the {{connection}} between the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and inflation {{despite the fact that the}} country has been running <b>deficit</b> <b>budgets</b> over the years. This has been attributed to the low revenue mobilization compared to the increasing expenditure requirements. For example, in 2012, total revenue was at 17.2 % of GDP compared to the expenditure requirements of 20.6 % of GDP in the same period (MoFPED 2013). The economy therefore has been typified by relatively high <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and inflation for a prolonged period of time. The few studies that have been conducted have also provided mixed results for the case of Uganda. For instance, Bwire and Nampewo (2014) examined the association between money creation, inflation and the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> in Uganda over the period 1999 Q 4 to 2012 Q 3. Using vector error correction model (VECM) and a pairwise Engle–Granger causality test, a long-run relationship between the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit,</b> money supply, inflation and the nominal exchange rate was found to hold. However, their results showed that only money supply Granger causes inflation in the short run. Although results of Granger causality tests revealed a unidirectional causality running from inflation to the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit,</b> no statistically significant causation was found from the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to inflation or from the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to money supply in the short run.|$|R
