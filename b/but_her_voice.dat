5|$|Carlotta {{continues}} to sing, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> croaks (as {{a result of}} the Phantom tampering with her throat spray) and the lead role is given to Christine. While the ballet is being performed, the Phantom, not realizing the performance change, encounters the chief stagehand Joseph Buquet and strangles him before hanging him from above, creating chaos. Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities him because of his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof. The Phantom, who witnessed the scene, becomes heartbroken. He then hears them both singing together. Growing furious at Raoul, he vows revenge on them both.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Wells {{recorded}} {{an album}} for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> began to fail, causing the singer {{to visit a}} local hospital. Doctors diagnosed Wells with laryngeal cancer. Treatments for the disease ravaged her voice, forcing her to quit her music career. Since she had no health insurance, her illness wiped out her finances, forcing her to sell her home. As she struggled to continue treatment, old Motown friends, including Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, members of the Temptations and Martha Reeves, made donations to support her, along {{with the help of}} admirers such as Dionne Warwick, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin and Bonnie Raitt. That same year, a benefit concert was held by fellow fan and Detroit R singer Anita Baker. Wells was also given a tribute by friends such as Stevie Wonder and Little Richard on The Joan Rivers Show.|$|E

500|$|The Fame Ball Tour {{received}} acclaim from critics. Whitney Pastorek from Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed {{review of}} the concert saying, [...] "Her onstage banter was at times a bit silly and the visuals occasionally lacking in coherent theme, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was strong and refreshingly free of overbearing tracking vocals. For all her cocky bluster, perhaps the most undeniable aspect of Gaga's talent is this: The girl can, and does, sing." [...] The show was described to be a [...] "sartorial experimentation that it made Rocky Horror look like cotillion. One presumed the Lady approved– and somewhere, to be sure, Andy Warhol stirred in his grave." ...|$|E
500|$|Sheva Alomar was {{designed}} {{during the early}} development phase of Resident Evil 5, with her designer Yosuke Yamagata calling her a [...] "new major protagonist" [...] who symbolizes the theme of [...] "the bonds of partnership". Her face and story background changed several times while she underwent many redesigns and re-imagining as developers searched for the right look to combine the qualities of [...] "feminine attraction" [...] and the [...] "strength of a fighting woman". Rejected concepts for Alomar included her being either a civilian, a guerrilla, or a military commander. Her character model was based on Australian actress Michelle Van Der Water, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> acting and motion capture were performed by American actress Karen Dyer.|$|E

500|$|Country singer Kelsea Ballerini {{recorded}} an unplugged {{version of}} [...] "Million Reasons" [...] and uploaded {{it on her}} Instagram account with the caption, [...] "Gaga over this new Gaga, and as always, bowing down to Hillary Lindsey [...] writing the best songs". Isis Briones from Vogue praised the cover saying that Ballerini [...] "stripped the track {{all the way down}} with just a guitar in hand and delivered an incredibly moving performance in just a few seconds. Not only will you want to replay this clip, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> on the song will get you to see in a completely different light." [...] The Voice contestant Christian Cuevas performed a cover of the song during the eleventh season of the show. The performance was appreciated with the judges complimenting it for creating an [...] "incredible moment" [...] for the show. Gaga also tweeted her approval of Cuevas' singing prowess.|$|E
500|$|... "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] {{was first}} {{recorded}} by singer Barbara Dickson in 1976 for the Evita concept album that eventually became the stage musical; Dickson {{did not appear}} in the musical itself. Rice and Webber had already enlisted actress Julie Covington to sing the part of Eva, hence they were on the look-out for other supporting vocal personnel. They found about Dickson who had recently starred in the Willy Russell musical, John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert, and had charted on the UK Singles Chart with her cover version of the David Whitfield and Frankie Laine song, [...] "Answer Me" [...] (1976). Dickson and her manager, Bernard Theobald, had a discussion with Rice and Webber about starring in the musical, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was declared [...] "too delicate" [...] for singing the numbers on Evita. So they offered her one-song which was not sung by Eva's character, and that was [...] "Another Suitcase in Another Hall".|$|E
500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a {{grand piano}} for guests at a listening party for Artpop in Berlin's Berghain nightclub. She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' But I do have a home. I have a home with you always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with tears in their eyes, watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her acting was {{no great}} things, they say-—ladylike, <b>but</b> frightened. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> is lovely, and as to her looks-—people rave about them. Tell me, {{she is not}} Lady Travis Underwood's daughter?" ...|$|R

500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles {{the issue of}} Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers {{a glimpse of a}} suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration. When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was so damn beautiful". He subsequently described the film as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "It doesn't really matter that [...] didn't want to do it the way I wanted it in every respect. He could obviously never do that. The film is his creative process", he said.|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E

500|$|Margaret's {{professional}} music {{career began}} during her final school year as singer-songwriter {{in the band}} oNieboLepiej (Much Better, formed in early January 2009), with whom she performed sung poetry. In 2009, she won the 254th episode of the Polish talent show Szansa na sukces (A Chance for Success), performing [...] "Znam Cię na pamięć" [...] ("I Know You by Heart", originally sung by Monika Brodka). After the win, she performed in the Szansa na sukces annual concert at Congress Hall in Warsaw. Margaret had appeared before on one of show's episodes in 2006, singing Stenia Kozłowska's song [...] "Będę czekać" [...] ("I'll Be Waiting"), and earned distinction In 2010, she appeared in Rent at the Szczecin Opera in the Castle. That year she became a singer-songwriter for the Margaret J. Project (also known as the Gosia Jamroży Project), a six-piece electropop band with R and hip hop influences which she created with music producer and bassist Adam Kabaciński. They performed in the semifinals of the 2010 Coke Live Fresh Noise competition. Although the group disbanded in November 2012, when Margaret decided to focus on her solo career, their [...] studio album was released online in 2013. In 2011, Margaret produced a fashion blog with music videos. In a 2013 interview with Gala, Margaret said that her manager discovered her through the blog. As her music career progressed, her blogging waned. Margaret recorded soundtracks for Polish television commercials early in her career, including [...] "Moments" [...] and [...] "It Will Be Lovely Day", which received radio airplay. According to Polish music manager Maja Sablewska, nobody {{knew who she was}} <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was [...] "ubiquitous". Margaret provided vocals for the 2012 biopic Bokser (Boxer) and the 2012 documentary Beauty and the Breast.|$|E
2500|$|... "How I Roll" [...] is {{the fifth}} track, {{produced}} by Bloodshy, Henrik Jonback and Magnus, where Spears [...] "pirouettes from a gulping in-and-out breath effect", and {{was described as a}} [...] "bubbly, playful pop song". Spears' voice is heavily altered, with her voice being put through many distorters, filters, and blenders. The song uses constant rushed handclaps, with elements which were compared to Janet Jackson's [...] "Strawberry Bounce". The sixth and seventh tracks [...] "Drop Dead (Beautiful)" [...] and [...] "Seal It With a Kiss" [...] were commented as [...] "fillers" [...] by Christopher Kostakis of Samesame.com.au. [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is Femme Fatales eighth track, and it was said that it [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". The song was further noted as being catchy, but repetitive by Idolator. [...] "Trouble for Me", the ninth song on the album, features a pre-chorus filled with [...] "melting, wheezing synths" [...] likened to a [...] "Wiley grime wobble," [...] segueing into a [...] "Janet Jackson vocal." [...] Spears' voice had been Auto-Tuned, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was described as [...] "raw" [...] and the tones and wines as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "one of a kind". [...] "Criminal", the last track on the album's standard edition, is a guitar-driven midtempo song, which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly said the song [...] "takes a breather from aggressive, wall-to-wall synths, driven instead by a steady guitar rhythm and an oddly Asian folky-sounding flute melody." [...] In the verses, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's no good at all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart". During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." ...|$|E
