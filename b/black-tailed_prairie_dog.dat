5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which {{typically}} form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often {{consists of an}} adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.|$|E

25|$|The Aspen Parkland is {{agricultural}} land. The {{most prominent}} wildlife species {{which may be}} found are coyote (Canis latrans), hare, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), snowshoe hare, cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and red fox. The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, American badger (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and ground squirrel such as <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> (Cynomys ludovicianus). Animal populations of the Mixed Grassland enumerate pronghorn, white-tailed and mule deer, long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), small-footed myotis (Myotis subulatus), jack rabbit, coyote, Richardson's ground squirrel. The only Canadian site of <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> is in the Mixed Grassland prairie ecoregion. The raised elevation of the Cypress Upland results in white spruce and aspen forests and an ecoregion more resembling the boreal forested areas than the prairielands. Moose, pronghorn, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, rabbit, and ground squirrel coyote are common in this ecoregion.|$|E

The Plague is now commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas which now account for over 95% of reported cases. The plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals.

25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of prairie dog burrows provide {{the greatest amount of}} cover for black-footed ferrets. <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E

5000|$|Hundreds {{of species}} of {{vertebrates}} [...] and invertebrates {{are associated with}} <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies. Vertebrate species richness on their colonies increases with colony size and density. West of the Missouri River in Montana, 40% (100 species) of all vertebrate fauna in prairie habitats rely on <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies for food, nesting, and/or denning. Rare and declining species, such as the black-footed ferret, swift fox (Vulpes velox), mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) are associated with colonies. Because their foraging activities keep plant development in a suppressed vegetative state with higher nutritional qualities, herbivores, including red deer (Cervus elaphus), American bison, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and domestic cattle often prefer foraging in <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies. Animals that depend on herbaceous cover in sagebrush habitat, such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and sage grouse (Centrocercus spp.), may be deterred by the decreased vegetative cover on <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies.

50|$|Black-tailed {{prairie dogs}} are {{frequently}} exterminated from ranchland, being viewed as pests. Their habitat has been fragmented, and their {{numbers have been}} greatly reduced.

40|$|Currently, zinc {{phosphide}} {{is the only}} toxicant registered in bait formulations for controlling <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> (Cynomys spp.).

However, its efficacy and weatherability have been questioned in recent years (Marsh 1987). In contrast, bromethalin {{is a relatively new}} acute rodenticide that has been used as an alternative method of control for anticoagulant-resistant commensal rodents (Spaulding and Jackson 1982). Its activity involves the uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation process in the central nervous system mitochondria (Van Lier and Ottosen 1981). Both acute and chronic toxicity of bromethalin result in visible signs, such as lethargy and weakness in the hind legs, that have been observed in field studies (Jackson et al 1982). <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> populations have increased recently in Nebraska: aerial coverage of <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> towns has increased from 6, 000 in 1975 ha to 35, 200 ha in 1988 (F.
