50|$|A {{syntactic}} unit of an idiolect {{system is}} a sequence of syntactic <b>base</b> <b>forms.</b> (Again, unit sequences, but not the empty sequence, are allowed as a limiting case of syntactic units, that is, a syntactic unit may contain a single syntactic <b>base</b> <b>form.)</b> In a system of a spoken idiolect, the syntactic <b>base</b> <b>forms</b> are precisely the phonological words occurring in the phonological {{part of the system}} (analogously, for systems of written and signed idiolects).|$|R
5000|$|A regular English verb {{has only}} one {{principal}} part, from which all the forms of the verb can be derived. This is the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> or dictionary form. For example, from the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> exist, all the inflected forms of the verb (exist, exists, existed, existing) can be predictably derived. The <b>base</b> <b>form</b> is also called the bare infinitive; another common way of referring to verbs {{is to use the}} to-infinitive, e.g. [...] "to exist".|$|R

Food historian Luis W. Fernandez claims a connection with Chinese cuisine as an origin.|$|R
50|$|The {{comparative}} {{is formed}} by adding -er to the <b>base</b> <b>form.</b> For adjectives that end in -r, the comparative is formed by adding -der to the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> instead.
