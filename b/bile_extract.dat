In addition, major metabolites were identified and measurements of OH-PAHs (1 -naphthol, 9 -phenantrol, 9 -fluorenol, 1 -pyrenol, 1 OH-BaP and 3 OH-BaP) and alkylphenols (4 - n-nonylphenol (4 - n-NP) and 4 -tertoctylphenol (4 - tert-OP)) in the same fish <b>bile</b> <b>extracts</b> were taken by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in electron ionization mode (GC-EI-MS). Relative in vitro estrogenic potencies of the chemically quantified compounds were also tested. The highest biliary concentrations of 1 -pyrenol, 9 -fluorenol and 4 -n-NP were found in fish from Barcelona and from the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. However, these concentrations can be considered relatively low compared to values reported in red mullet from other polluted waters in the Mediterranean Sea. The contribution of 1 -pyrenol, 4 -n-NP and 4 -tert-OP to the total estrogenic potency measured in male fish bile {{was found to be}} negligible, indicating the presence of other estrogenic compounds in red mullet bile.

40|$|AbstractThe {{glutathione}} conjugate of 2 -furamide {{has been}} screened for and structurally characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) {{by using a}} hybrid instrument of BEqQ design. Mass spectrometry experiments employed fast atom bombardment (FAB) ionization of a crude <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> from a rat dosed with a 1 : 1 mixture of unlabeled and [13 C 1] 2 -furamide. Initial screening for glutathione conjugates employed constant neutral loss scanning to detect the loss of 129 u, corresponding {{to the loss of}} the γ-glutamyl moiety of the conjugates. By direct comparison with control bile, [M + H]+ ions of m/z 417 and 418 were readily identified as candidate ions corresponding to the glutathione conjugates of unlabeled and 13 C-labeled 2 -furamide. Complementary screening information was generated by using a methylated <b>bile</b> <b>extract,</b> with constant neutral loss scanning to detect the loss of the methylated γ-glutamyl moiety (143 u). An alternative screening procedure employing parent ion scanning to detect the sodium adducts of methylated glutathione conjugates was also developed. Structural information was generated by first-generation product ion scanning of the protonated and sodium cationized forms of the candidate species, both native and derivatized. This provided a body of internally consistent evidence that the conjugate retains the pseudoaromatic furan ring system without ring hydroxylation. The utility of sequential mass spectrometry (MS/MS/MS) capability of the hybrid instrument in the analysis of complex biological mixtures was also demonstrated. Using the <b>bile</b> <b>extract,</b> first-generation product ions that formed in either the first or second field-free region of the double-focusing portion of the instrument were subsequently collisionally activated in the rf-only quadrupole followed by mass analysis of the second-generation product ions. Structural information so provided for the glutathione conjugate of 2 -furamide further substantiated its retention of the pseudoaromatic furan ring system and facilitated plausible assignment of structures to ionic species generated through multiple decomposition events...|$|E

The target residues for surveillance of abuse in bovine urine and bile samples are 17 a- and 17 b- 19 NT, although this choice of target residues {{is not based on}} in vivo radiotracer biotransformation data. In this study, four steers were administered [3 H 2]- and [2 H 3] 17 b- 19 NT laurate (2 mg kg 21 body mass) by intramuscular injection and blood, urine, faeces and bile samples were taken for 30 d until slaughter, after which tissues were sampled for total residue analysis. Total plasma radiolabelled residues reached a maximum of 56. 3 ± 15. 9 pmol ml 21 at 36 h and were still appreciable (13. 3 ± 1. 6 pmol ml 21) 30 d after treatment. Throughout the study period, total residue concentrations in bile (about 2 – 16 nmol ml 21), urine and faeces (0. 5 – 3 nmol ml 21 or g 21) were higher than in other tissues sampled at slaughter.

An electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition technique was used to prepare corn oil-in-water emulsions (3 wt% oil) that contained droplets coated by (1) lecithin, (2) lecithin–chitosan, or (3) lecithin–chitosan–pectin. Pancreatic lipase (1. 6 mg mL− 1) and/or <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> (5. 0 mg mL− 1) were added to each emulsion, and the particle charge, droplet aggregation, and free fatty acids released were measured. In the presence of <b>bile</b> <b>extract,</b> the amount of fatty acids released per unit amount of emulsion was much lower in the emulsions containing droplets coated by lecithin–chitosan (38 ± 16 μmol mL− 1) than those containing droplets coated by lecithin (250 ± 70 μmol mL− 1) or lecithin–chitosan–pectin (274 ± 80 μmol mL− 1). In addition, there was much more extensive droplet aggregation in the lecithin–chitosan emulsion than in the other two emulsions. We postulated that lipase activity was reduced in the lecithin–chitosan emulsion as a result of the formation of a relatively thick cationic layer around each droplet, as well as the formation of large flocs, which restricted the access of the pancreatic lipase to the lipids within the droplets. Our results also suggest that droplets initially coated by a lecithin–chitosan–pectin layer did not inhibit lipase activity, which may have been because the chitosan–pectin desorbed from the droplet surfaces thereby allowing the enzyme to reach the lipids; however, further work is needed to establish this. This information could be used to create food emulsions with low caloric level, or to optimize diets for individuals with lipid digestion problems...|$|E

In general, total PAHs concentrations in soils from traffic areas {{were significantly higher than}} that from the other sites, indicating a dominant contribution from motor vehicles. Physiologically based in vitro tests were used to evaluate the oral bioaccessibility of PAHs in Surface soil under different land uses in Beijing regarding both gastric and small intestinal conditions. It was found that the oral bioaccessibility of total PAHs in small intestinal condition, ranging from 9. 2 % to 60. 5 % of total PAHs in soil. was significantly higher than gastric condition, ranging from 3. 9 % to 54. 9 %. The bioaccessibility of individual PAHs in soils generally, decreased with the increasing ring number of PAHs in both gastric and small intestinal conditions. However, the ratio of bioaccessibility of individual PAHs in gastric condition to that in small intestinal condition, generally increased with increasing ring number, indicating the relatively pronounced effect of <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> on improving bioacccssibility of PAHs with relatively high ring numbers characterized by their high K-ow values. The observation that <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> at a level higher than critical micelle concentration could reduce the surface tension of digestive juice substantially, which may cause PAHs to be available for intestinal absorption, calls for more careful establishment of reliable soil criteria for PAHs, especially concerning the health of children who may ingest a considerable amount of PAH-contaminated soil via Outdoor hand-mouth activities.

Novel galactooligosaccharides synthesized from lactulose (GOS-Lu) as well as commercial galactooligosaccharides synthesized from lactose (GOS-La) and lactulose were used as carbon sources and compared with glucose. In general, all strains grew in all carbon sources, although after 24 h of fermentation the population of all Lactobacillus strains was higher for both types of GOS than for glucose and lactulose. No differences were found among GOS-Lu and GOS-La. α-amylase and pancreatin resistance was retained at all times for all strains. However, a dependence on carbon source and Lactobacillus strain was observed for <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> and low pH resistance. High hydrophobicity was found for all strains with GOS-Lu when compared with other carbon sources. However, concentrations of lactic and acetic acids were higher in glucose and lactulose than GOS-Lu and GOS-La. These results show that the resistance to gastrointestinal conditions and hydrophobicity is directly related with the carbon source and Lactobacillus strains. In this sense, the use of prebiotics as GOS and lactulose could be an excellent alternative to monosaccharides to support growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains and improve their survival through the gastrointestinal tract. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The interfacial tension and rheology of the multilayers was rather similar to those found for single whey protein layers, as well as their resistance to duodenal conditions and lipolytic components, which is explained by the rapid destabilisation of multilayers at neutral pH. Sequential adsorption of <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> or lipase to pre-adsorbed films rapidly lowered the interfacial tension via co-adsorption and displacement, forming a viscoelastic film with low mechanical strength, and highly dynamic adsorption/desorption. When both were present, bile salts dominated the initial adsorption, followed by lipase co-adsorption and formation of lipolysis products that further lowered the interfacial tension, forming a complex interface (including biopolymers, bile salts, lipase, and lipolysis products), independent of pre-adsorbed biopolymer layers. Our study shows that the combination of drop volume tensiometry and reflectometry can be used to study complex interfacial behaviours under digestive conditions, which can lead to smart design of interfacial structures for controlled lipolysis in food emulsions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Eryngium foetidum (EF) {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{medicinal}} plant and culinary spice in tropical regions. Phytochemicals in its leaves have been proposed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The present study used in vitro digestion coupled with Caco- 2 cells to assess such activities. Caco- 2 cells were incubated with aqueous fraction from simulated digestion (bioaccessible fraction) of EF leaves with/without <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> prior to stimulation with interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β). Monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and IL- 8 in culture media and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. Approximately 24 % β-carotene and 35 % lutein of leaves were present in the aqueous fraction. The transfer of caffeic and chlorogenic acids to the aqueous fraction was 76 %– 81 %, while that of kaempferol was 48 %. Prior incubation of Caco- 2 cells with the bioaccessible fraction suppressed IL- 1 β activated IL- 8 and MCP- 1 by 33 %, but the fraction lacking mixed micelles decreased IL- 8 and MCP- 1 levels only by 11 %. The pretreatment of Caco- 2 cells with the bioaccessible fraction of EF reduced ROS by 34 %; the fraction lacking mixed micelles decreased ROS by 28 %. These data suggest that bioactive compounds partitioning in mixed micelles play a significant role to suppress the proinflammatory insult but with a modest antioxidant effect...|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} and yeasts, representing the prevailing microbiota associated with different foods generally consumed without any cooking, {{were identified and}} characterized in vitro for some functional properties, such as acid-bile tolerance and antigenotoxic activity. In particular, 22 Lactobacillus plantarum strains and 14 yeasts were studied. The gastro-intestinal tract tolerance of all the strains was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37 °C to a simulated gastric juice (pH 2. 0), containing pepsin (0. 3 % w/v) and to a simulated small intestinal juice (pH 8. 0), containing pancreatin (1 mg mL- 1) and <b>bile</b> <b>extract</b> (0. 5 %), thus monitoring changes in total viable count. In general, following a strain-dependent behavior, all the tested strains persisted alive after combined acid-bile challenge. Moreover, many strains showed high in vitro inhibitory activity against a model genotoxin, 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 -NQO), {{as determined by the}} short-term method, SOS-Chromotest. Interestingly, the supernatants from bacteria- or yeasts-genotoxin co-incubations exhibited a suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4 -NQO on the tester strain Escherichia coli PQ 37 (sfiA::lacZ) exceeding, in general, the value of 75 %. The results highlight that food associated microorganisms may reach the gut in viable form and prevent genotoxin DNA damage in situ. Our experiments can contribute to elucidate the functional role of food-associated microorganisms general recognized as safe ingested with foods {{as a part of the}} diet...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSubstances {{structurally}} and functionally {{similar to}} digitalis glycosides {{are produced by}} several vertebrate species. There also is evidence for a digitalis-like substance of human origin. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to study the direct effects on the cellular electrophysiology of canine Purkinje fibers of 1) bufalin, an unconjugated cardiotonic steroid molecule that is produced by the toad Bufo marinus, and 2) an extract of human bite that showed digitalis-like immunoreactivity on radioimmunoassay. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether these substances have arrhythmogenic effects comparable with those seen with toxic doses of digitalis glycosides. Bufalin, 2 × 10 − 8 M, significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced maximal diastolic potential, action potential amplitude and duration and maximal rate of rise of phase 0 (Vmax) within 40 min of onset of exposure. All six fibers developed delayed afterdepolarizations and two developed triggered rhythms. Ouabain was less potent, in that a 2 × 10 − 7 Mconcentration was required to comparably reduce maximal diasolic potential, action potential amplitude and duration and Vmaxwithin 30 min. These Purkinje fibers also developed delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered rhythms. A sample of an <b>extract</b> of human <b>bile</b> that showed digitalislike immunoreactivity with an antibufalin serum also reduced maximal diastolie potential, action potential amplitude and duration and Vmax, and produced delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. In contrast, immunologically unreactive <b>bile</b> <b>extracts</b> had no appreciable effect on the action potential. In summary, the cardiac toxicity of digitalis substances produced by lower vertebrates is comparable with that induced by the glycosides. Moreover, it appears that humans may produce digitalis-like substances that may be cardiotoxic...|$|R
