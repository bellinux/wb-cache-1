As early as 1960, then-First Division Luton's attendances had been deemed far {{too low for}} the top flight by Charles Buchan's Football Monthly, which also {{considered}} their ground at Kenilworth Road, {{in the middle of}} town, to <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to. At this time the club was already planning a 50,000-capacity ground near Dunstable, to the north-west of Luton, but no new ground materialised. Luton were relegated in 1960 and, apart from the 1974–75 season, remained outside of the top division until 1982–83.|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, {{the writers}} told GameSpot that God of War will [...] "improve on films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals {{by taking a}} step in a bolder direction." [...] Melton said that Sony has [...] "encouraged" [...] them to make it {{different}} from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it will <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done. As of [...] , , the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been [...] "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million USD.|$|E
2500|$|The Mystery of the Sea {{received}} reasonably positive reviews {{around the}} time of its publication; the reviewers writing in 1902 tend to focus on Stoker's skill {{and the fact that the}} novel is an engaging read, admitting (in some cases reluctantly, others forcefully) that the novel is melodramatic and contains a somewhat disparate variety of elements. Most of these turn-of-the-century reviewers are quick to identify The Mystery of the Sea as a work of sensation, or at least as a work that contains sensational elements, and they are in general agreement that Stoker is a skilled writer of mystery. A reviewer writing for The Bookman calls the novel [...] "one of those weirdly sensational stories that no living author writes better than Mr. Bram Stoker". [...] The Dial categorizes it as [...] "a bit of glowing melodrama" [...] that will [...] "keep one awake o' nights", and admits that it would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more action…between the covers of a book than will be found here" [...] (an observation which other reviewers do not construe as positive). [...] Punch praises Stoker's [...] "breezy personality" [...] and his ability to create a story with [...] "the rare quality of adventure that enthralls the boys and pleases their parents". This same review is appreciative of Stoker's writing style and depictions of landscape as well. These reviews situate The Mystery of the Sea between the realm of light fiction or juvenile reading and more sophisticated mystery. Other reviewers recognize these same elements of melodrama, but do not characterize them as examples of Stoker's authorial skill. A sarcastic and somewhat hostile review from The Saturday Review says that the novel is [...] "rather overcrowded", and proceeds to list off the tropes that Stoker employs from various genres. This reviewer admits that Stoker weaves the different strands together well, but that he is [...] "hardly justified in framing such colossal machinery to produce results more simply attained by less ambitious sensationalists".|$|E

60|$|For, {{notwithstanding}} these learned disputants, these all-knowing doctors, {{it was to}} the unscholastic statesman {{that the}} governments of the world owed their peace, defence, and liberties; and from the illiterate and contemned mechanic (a name of disgrace) that they received the improvements of useful arts. Nevertheless, this artificial ignorance, and learned gibberish, prevailed mightily in these last ages, by the interest and artifice of those who found no easier way to that pitch of authority and dominion they have attained, than by amusing the men of business, and ignorant, with hard words, or employing the ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms, and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth. Besides, there is no such way to gain admittance, or give defence to strange and absurd doctrines, as to guard them round about with legions of obscure, doubtful, and undefined words. Which yet make these retreats more like the dens of robbers, or holes of foxes, than the fortresses of fair warriors; which, if it <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them out of, it is not for the strength that is in them, but the briars and thorns, and the obscurity of the thickets they are beset with. For untruth being unacceptable to the mind of man, there is no other defence left for absurdity but obscurity.|$|E
6000|$|This Capitalist is {{an ingenious}} person, and has many {{polished}} characteristics; but I {{think the most}} singular thing about him is his staggering lack of shame. Neither the hour of death nor the day of reckoning, neither the tent of exile nor the house of mourning, neither chivalry nor patriotism, neither womanhood nor widowhood, is safe at this supreme moment from his dirty little expedient of dieting the slave. As similar bullies, when they collect the slum rents, put a foot in the open door, these are always ready to push in a muddy wedge wherever there is a slit in a sundered household or a crack in a broken heart. To a man of any manhood nothing can be conceived more loathsome and sacrilegious than even so much as asking whether {{a woman who has}} given up all she loved to death and the fatherland has or has not shown some weakness in her seeking for self-comfort. I know not in which of the two cases I should count myself the baser for inquiring--a case where the charge was false or a case where it was true. But the philanthropic employer of the sort I describe is not a man of any manhood; in a sense he is not a man at all. He shows some consciousness of the fact when he calls his workers [...] "men" [...] as distinct from masters. He cannot comprehend the gallantry of costermongers or the delicacy that is quite common among cabmen.
