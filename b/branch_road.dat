5|$|MD 10 {{continues}} {{north from}} MD 177 through {{the east side}} of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace <b>Branch</b> <b>Road)</b> north then meets the latter highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The sweeping ramp from MD 10 to westbound I-695 merges into a collector-distributor lane that allows access from MD 10 to northbound MD 2 in Brooklyn Park.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of town, M-55 leaves the freeway and turns east again running through the Pere Marquette State Forest along Watergate Road. When the highway meets M-66, M-55 joins M-66 and runs north through farmland. As the two {{highways}} approach Lake City, they run along the shore of Lake Missaukee and through downtown. M-55 turns east again along Houghton Lake Road, separating from M-66 north of the central business district. This section of trunkline passes through mixed farm and wood lands that transitions to mostly forests near Merritt. The road crosses the Muskegon River and follows Lake City Road into the outskirts of Houghton Lake. M-55 passes over the US127 freeway and enters Houghton Lake Heights. There the highway runs southeasterly along the shores of Houghton Lake into downtown Houghton Lake. M-18 briefly joins M-55 through Prudenville on {{the east side}} of the lake, and M-55 follows West <b>Branch</b> <b>Road</b> as it continues east toward Interstate 75 (I-75).|$|E
5|$|M-55/M-76 ran west into Roscommon County along West <b>Branch</b> <b>Road.</b> The two {{highways}} separated at a junction with St. Helen Road where M-76 turned due {{north toward}} St. Helen. South of town, the highway met county road F-97 at a junction with Artesia Beach Road. The two roads ran concurrently into town {{along the east}} end of Lake St. Helen. Near the airport in town, M-76 turned back northwesterly along Washington Street, parting from F-97 in the process. The highway ran along the northeastern shore of Lake St. Helen and near Mud Lake as it continued toward Roscommon. As it entered that town, the trunkline passed the Roscommon Conservation Airport and followed Elm Street on a northwest track through the middle of the village. M-18 joined M-76 in the center of town, and the two turned parallel to the Roscommonâ€“Crawford county line on Federal Highway. Northeast of Higgins Lake, the highway transitioned to a freeway; that freeway ran northwest into Crawford County. M-18/M-76 terminated at a junction south of Grayling with US27. This partial interchange marked the point where I-75 resumed its course north through the state. Traffic could not directly access southbound US27 from northbound M-76 and northbound US27 could not access southbound M-76.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{past this}} interchange, the route intersects MD 177 (Mountain Road) and {{continues}} north past more businesses and the Marley Station Mall. MD 2 narrows to four lanes again and continues through residential neighborhoods in Glen Burnie. Before the intersection with Fitzallen Road/Aquahart Road, the route passes Harundale Plaza, which was originally the Harundale Mall, the first enclosed mall on the East Coast, built in 1958. The road passes more residences and then businesses before again crossing over MD 648. Past MD 648, the route continues through commercial areas consisting of numerous businesses and runs {{a short distance}} {{to the east of}} MD 3 Bus. (Crain Highway). It intersects MD 270 (Furnace <b>Branch</b> <b>Road)</b> before MD 3 Bus. merges into MD 2. The route continues north as a six-lane highway and intersects MD 710 (Ordnance Road). It passes more businesses before coming to an exit and southbound entrance with a spur of I-895 (I-895B) that provides access to and from I-97, westbound I-695, and I-895. A short distance later, MD 2 interchanges with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial interchange. At this interchange, MD 711 (Arundel Corporation Road) provides the access from eastbound I-695 to MD 2. Past I-695, MD 2 continues north as a four-lane divided highway that runs through residential and commercial areas of Arundel Gardens, intersecting the western terminus of MD 171 (Church Street). Past MD 171, the route passes through more commercial areas in Brooklyn Park before coming to an intersection with MD 170 (Belle Grove Road) at the boundary of Baltimore city.|$|E

The state highway continues northeast from Flower Avenue as a municipally maintained highway until it reaches the north city limit of Takoma Park beyond Garland Avenue, where the highway becomes state maintained again. MD 195, which closely follows the city limit to its northern terminus, crosses Long Branch and veers north out of the stream valley. The highway gains an intermittent median and has a northbound service road, which is unsigned MD 195A, and passes the Davis-Warner House. MD 195 reaches its northern terminus at an oblique intersection with MD 193 (University Boulevard) on {{the eastern edge of}} Silver Spring.

25|$|East of {{the federal}} agency's campus, MD 117 has a partial {{interchange}} with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The interchange consists of a straight ramp from the state highway to southbound I-270 and a loop ramp from northbound I-270 to MD 117. Connections with I-270 {{in the direction of}} Frederick are made via the freeway's interchange with MD 124 to the north.

25|$|Heraclea was {{certainly}} {{at this time}} in alliance with the Tarentines and Lucanians against Rome; and it was doubtless with the view of detaching it from this alliance that the Romans were induced shortly afterwards (278BCE) to grant to the Heracleans a treaty of alliance on such favorable terms that it is called by Cicero prope singulare foedus. Heraclea preserved this privileged condition throughout the period of the Roman Republic; and hence, even when in 89BCE the Lex Plautia Papiria conferred upon its inhabitants, in common with the other cities of Italy, the rights of Roman citizens, they hesitated long whether they would accept the proffered boon. We hear that Heraclea surrendered under compulsion to Hannibal in 212BCE. We have no account of the part taken by Heraclea in the Social War; but from an incidental notice in Cicero, that all the public records of the city had been destroyed by fire at that period, it would seem to have suffered severely. Cicero nevertheless speaks of it, in his defence of the poet Aulus Licinius Archias (who had been adopted as a citizen of Heraclea), as still a flourishing and important town, and it appears to {{have been one of the}} few Greek cities in the south of Italy that still preserved their consideration under the Roman dominion. Its name is unaccountably omitted by the 2nd century AD geographer Ptolemy; but its existence at a much later period is attested by the Antonine Itinerary and the Tabula Peutingeriana. It was still a place of some importance under the empire; a <b>branch</b> <b>road</b> from Venusia joined the coast road at Heraclea.|$|E
