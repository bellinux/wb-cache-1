The reaction of methanolic solution of N – histidyl – 2, 4 – pentanedione Schiff base with ethanolic solution of copper (II) chloride gave diaquo <b>bis</b> (<b>N</b> – histidyl- 2, 4 - pentanedionato) copper (II) complex. The prepared Schiff base is crystalline orange yellow, has a yield of 51 % and melting point of 292 oC. The prepared diaquo <b>bis</b> (<b>N</b> – histidyl- 2, 4 - pentanedionato) copper (II) complex is crystalline green, has a yield of 72 % and decomposition temperature of 345 oC. The Schiff base is soluble in most solvent including water, but insoluble in ether. The diaquo <b>bis</b> (<b>N</b> – histidyl- 2, 4 - pentanedionato) copper (II) complex is soluble in water, DMSO and DMF, but insoluble in most common organic solvents. The molar conductance of copper (II) Schiff base complex determined is 31 ohm- 1 cm 2 mol- 1. The infra-red spectral data showed bands in the range 1612 – 1634 and 1590 - 1610 cm- 1, assignable to v(C=N) stretching vibrations of Schiff base and its copper (II) complex, respectively. The broad bands in the range 3345 - 3470 and 3352 - 3431 cm- 1 are attributable to v(O-H) stretching frequencies in the Schiff base and it complex compound, respectively. The weak bands at 543 and 362 cm- 1 are attributable to v(Cu-O) and v(Cu-N) stretching vibrations, respectively in the copper (II) Schiff base complex.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of two variants of BI in psychiatric outpatients.

Methods: Psychiatric outpatients with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores indicating hazardous or harmful drinking were invited to participate in the study. The outpatients were randomized to minimal (assessment, feedback, and an informational leaflet) or BI (personalized advice added). Measurements were performed at baseline and at six and 12 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was change in AUDIT score at the 12 -month follow-up. Results: In all, 150 patients were enrolled and received either a minimal intervention (n = 68) or <b>BI</b> (<b>n</b> = 82).
