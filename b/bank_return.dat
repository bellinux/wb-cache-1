40|$|Today, {{technological}} and scientific developments impact the banking sector {{and enhance the}} commercial, as well as financial functionality of the banking sector. Improvement of this functionality caused a gradual increase in the banks’ profits; {{as a result of}} which, the bank profits now has become more crucial for the market. The cruciality {{is a result of the}} fact that banking sector’s revenues do not concern the bank owners and partners only; the revenues also concern the investors that trade stocks of the banks. This paper discusses the macro economical factors that have certain impact on the bank revenues, to which more importance has been attached for recent years. This paper takes basis BIST Top 10 <b>Bank</b> <b>Return</b> Index monthly data between January 2010 and July 2014.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine dynamic {{interactions}} and long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>banking</b> stock <b>returns</b> and key monetary variables in a period of relative economic stability, post financial deregulation in Australia. The importance of the study lies in its demonstration of banking market efficiency under these environments supporting rational expectations in Australian banking. Vector autoregressive models are applied to analyse optimally lagged data. In a bivariate <b>bank</b> stock <b>returns</b> model which includes interest rates and exchange rates there is evidence of cointegration. Consistent with theory, Australia's <b>bank</b> stock <b>returns</b> and long-term interest rates are negatively related. Long-term interest rates are exogenous. The study is also important as it demonstrates that in these environments, interest rates and exchange rates assist in the forecasting of Australian <b>bank</b> <b>returns.</b> In accordance with theory, contractionary monetary policy implementation leads to lower <b>banking</b> stock <b>returns</b> and expansionary policy will have the opposite effect...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{there is}} a lot of {{literature}} concerned with the volatility of the real estate sector, while little attention has been paid to systemic risk measure in the real estate sector. Real estate often constitutes a major item on bank balance sheets, and affects <b>banking</b> <b>return</b> (Mei and Anthony 1995; He 2002; Elyasiani et al. 2010; Martins et al. 2011). However, according to our knowledge, there is no study on the investigation of the impact of the real estate sector on <b>banking</b> <b>return</b> from the perspective of systemic risk.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of loan {{portfolio}} focus versus diversification on the return {{and the risk of}} 105 Italian banks over the period 1993 – 99 using data on bank-by-bank exposures to different industries and sectors. We find that diversification is not guaranteed to produce superior performance and/or greater safety for banks. For high-risk banks, diversification reduces <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> while producing riskier loans. For low-risk banks, diversification produces either an inefficient risk-return trade-off or only a marginal improvement. Our results are consistent with a deterioration in the effectiveness of bank monitoring at high risk-levels and upon lending expansion into newer or competitive industries. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} large panel {{of more than}} 100 banks from Argentina to {{study the effects of}} bank {{consolidation}} on performance between December 1995 and December 2000, a period of heavy bank consolidation and relative calm.

Additionally, the study suggests that mergers and privatizations have a beneficial effect on <b>bank</b> <b>returns.</b> The effects of a <b>bank</b> acquisition on <b>return</b> on equity is, however, negative. Acquisitions do not seem to have any effect on risk-adjusted returns.

However, a strong link is found between the <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> co-movements and bank default risk measured by a z-score.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the aggregate {{performance of the}} banking industry, applying a modified and extended dynamic decomposition of <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> on equity.

We extend those analyses to derive an ideal dynamic decomposition that includes their dynamic decomposition as one component. We also extend the decomposition, consider geography, and implement decomposition on a state-by-state basis, linking that geographic decomposition back to the national level. We then consider how deregulation of geographic restrictions on bank activity affects {{the components of the}} state-level dynamic decomposition, controlling for competition and {{the state of the economy}} within each state an...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{complements}} exiting African liberalization {{literature by}} providing fresh patterns of two main areas. First, it assesses whether African banking institutions {{have benefited from}} liberalization policies in terms of bank returns. Second, it models <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> and return uncertainty {{in the context of}} openness policies to examine fresh patterns for the feasibility of common policy initiatives. The empirical evidence is based on 28 African countries for the period 1999 - 2010. Varying non-overlapping intervals and autoregressive orders are employed for robustness purposes. The findings show that, while trade openness has increased bank returns and return uncertainties, financial openness and institutional liberalization have decreased bank returns and reduced return uncertainty respectively. But for some scanty evidence of convergence in return on equity, there is overwhelming absence of catch-up among sampled countries. Implications for regional integration and portfolio diversification are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|This study compares geochemical and {{physical}} methods of estimating baseflow {{in the upper}} reaches of the Barwon River, southeast Australia. Estimates of baseflow from physical techniques such as local minima and recursive digital filters are higher than those based on chemical mass balance using continuous electrical conductivity (EC). Between 2001 and 2011 the baseflow flux calculated using chemical mass balance is between 1. 8 × 10 3 and 1. 5 × 10 4 ML yr − 1 (15 to 25 % of the total discharge in any one year) whereas recursive digital filters yield baseflow fluxes of 3. 6 × 10 3 to 3. 8 × 10 4 ML yr − 1 (19 to 52 % of discharge) and the local minimum method yields baseflow fluxes of 3. 2 × 10 3 to 2. 5 × 10 4 ML yr − 1 (13 to 44 % of discharge). These differences most probably reflect how the different techniques characterise baseflow. Physical methods probably aggregate much of the water from delayed sources as baseflow. However, as many delayed transient water stores (such as <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> flow or floodplain storage) are likely to be geochemically similar to surface runoff, chemical mass balance calculations aggregate them with the surface runoff component. The mismatch between geochemical {{and physical}} estimates is greatest following periods of high discharge in winter, implying that these transient stores of water feed the river for several weeks to months. Consistent with these interpretations, modelling of bank storage indicates that <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> flows provide water to the river for several weeks after flood events. EC vs. discharge variations during individual flow events also imply that an inflow of low EC water stored within the banks or on the floodplain occurs as discharge falls. The joint use of physical and geochemical techniques allows a better understanding of the different components of water that contribute to river flow, which is important for the management and protection of water resources...|$|E
40|$|We use the CoVaR {{approach}} {{to identify the}} main factors behind systemic risk {{in a set of}} large international banks.

We also show that asymmetries based on the sign of <b>bank</b> <b>returns</b> {{play an important role in}} capturing the sensitivity of system-wide risk to individual <b>bank</b> <b>returns.</b> Since short-term wholesale funding emerges as the most relevant systemic factor, our results support the Basel Committee’s proposal to introduce a net stable funding ratio, penalizing excessive exposure to liquidity risk...|$|R

30|$|Generally, indicators, such as banks’ net {{interest}} margin (NIM), return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA) and stock return, are used to measure <b>banking</b> <b>return</b> (García-Herrero et al. 2009; Alessandri and Nelson 2015). China’s banking system is highly dependent on the deposit-loan interest margin, with interest margin being the main profit of banks. Therefore, we use the average of banks’ {{net interest}} margin (NIM) to measure <b>banking</b> <b>return.</b> Some {{studies have found that}} degree of risk aversion (RA) and implicit interest expense (IIE) are the determinants of <b>banking</b> <b>return</b> (Ho and Saunders 1981; Maudos and De Guevara 2004; Mensah and Abor 2014). Therefore, RA and IIE are chosen as control variables when conducting empirical analysis. Maudos and De Guevara (2004) find that the more banks’ own capitals are, the higher the degree of banks’ risk aversion is. Hence, we use the average of all banks’ proportions of equity capital to total assets to measure banking RA. Following Angbazo (1997), Saunders and Schumacher (2000) and Maudos and De Guevara (2004), we adopt the average of all banks’ proportions of the difference between non-interest expense and non-interest income to total assets to measure banking IIE.|$|R
40|$|We study optimal bank capital {{choice as}} a dynamic {{tradeoff}} between the opportunity cost of equity, {{the loss of}} franchise value following a regulatory minimum capital violation, {{and the cost of}} recapitalization. Our model indicates that a recapitalization option may be valuable despite substantial delays and costs of capital issuance, and that a significant fraction of the value of low capitalized banks may be attributable to the option to recapitalize. We calibrate the model to bank accounting return data and evaluate the model’s ability to explain observed bank capital ratios. We find that the model has the potential to replicate a significant amount of the cross-sectional variation in bank capital ratios by relating these to differences in return volatility. Differences in the level of capital market imperfections across banks constitute a secondary explanation. Our analysis points to the need for improved forward looking estimates of <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> volatility...|$|E
40|$|We study optimal bank capital {{holdings}} in a dynamic setting where {{the bank has}} access to external capital, but this access is subject to a fixed cost and a delay. Our model indicates that a recapitalization option may be valuable despite substantial fixed costs, and that a significant fraction {{of the value of}} low capitalized banks may be attributable to the option to recapitalize. When calibrated to data on actual bank returns, the model yields capital ratios that are significantly lower than actual bank capital ratios. This shortfall is, at least partly, explained by the skewness of the distribution of actual bank returns and by the banks ' accounting options for the provisioning of credit losses. We operate the model with implied <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> volatilities, {{in the same way as}} Black-Scholes model is used in practice. Analysis of the limiting cases where the capital market imperfections vanish reveals that the capital issue delay rather than the fixed cost determines the qualitative nature of the solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the course is to survey three recent developments in international capital markets that have dramatically changed the scope of applications for the related financial products. A. Leveraged finance: a revolution in roles. The leveraged finance market has in recent years evolved dramatically from commercial bank lending to a vibrant, liquid capital market driven by institutional investors. The banking industry consolidation and the increased <b>bank</b> <b>return</b> hurdles have made commercial banks more cautious {{in their use of}} capital for traditional lending. Instead, banks have focused in originating credit-intensive products for specialized investors in search of aggressive returns. A key driver of this innovation are the leverage buyout firms, who have borrowed most of the capital available through aggressive leveraged debt. New dynamics are now governing the debt market, although last summer credit crisis has highlighted the risks of such strategies. B.
