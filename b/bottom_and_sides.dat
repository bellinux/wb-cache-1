Cold water enters the tank near the bottom, heats and rises to the top where it is piped back into the home.|$|E
25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E

500|$|Underwire bras {{are built}} with a {{semi-circular}} [...] "underwire", [...] "bra wire", or [...] "wire" [...] {{embedded in the}} wire channel that circles the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of each cup. One end, or head element, of the underwire {{is close to the}} front and center of the bra, and the other close to the armhole. The underwire can be made of metal or molded plastic; most are metallic. Plastic underwire has a very small share of the market because it does not provide the same support and rigidity offered by metal underwire. A metallic underwire is a thin strip of metal, usually with a nylon coating at both ends.|$|E
500|$|The underwire bra design {{emerged and}} took {{hold in the}} United States {{starting}} in the 1930s. Helene Pons received a patent in 1931 for a brassiere design that incorporated an [...] "open-ended wire loop" [...] that laid flat against the chest, encircling the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of each breast. A 1932 patent describes a U-shaped piece of wire used between the cups to keep the breasts separated. A patent issued in 1938 to Pauline Boris describes a [...] "breast support" [...] which used pieces of wire to entirely encircle each breast. In 1940, Walter Emmett Williams was issued a patent which described a wire framework, shaped like a spiderweb, that encircles and covers each breast to provide support. Although development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s, it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use.|$|E

These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the tank and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{the stern}} {{is at the}} right angle {{to the rest of}} the boat. Approximately [...] forward of the stern, a {{transverse}} groove was cut into the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> to support the transom piece. Forward of the transom several grooves were cut to support transverse shelves, with the most aft shelf covering the transom. Such fitted transoms, which enclose the end of the log, were relatively common in prehistoric logboats. In the case of the Hasholme boat, the rotted heart prevented the construction of an integrated bow and stern, therefore both sections had to be precisely fitted and watertight. The transom itself is 1 m high and 1.08 m in breadth, with rounded lower profile and upper corners cut away. The thickness varies from 25mm to 90mm. At the top portion of the transom there are two horizontal holes without any visible wear. Since the original transom weighed between [...] those holes were necessary to place it inside the grooves. Those grooves were later caulked with some mixture of mosses and twigs to make the whole structure watertight. The upper corner of the starboard was cut away and a long tree-nail driven through both sides of the hull. tightening the transom in place. The second function of this tree-nail was to form a tie between both sides of the hull, with similar beam-ties in the bow section of the boat.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carbidic Austempered Ductile Iron (CADI) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) family. The effect of chills on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CADI was investigated after Austempering. Three samples of chromium alloyed CADI, the first sample without chill, the second sample with <b>bottom</b> chill <b>and</b> the third sample with <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>side</b> chills were produced in order to evaluate the effect of chills on its mechanical properties. The samples were austenised for 2 hours at 925 ° C and then austempered at 325 ° C for 2 hours in a salt bath furnace. The microstructural features of the as-cast and the austempered CADI samples were analysed using Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The mechanical properties of the CADI samples (as-cast and austempered) were evaluated for hardness, impact and wear. By austempering at 325 ° C for 2 hours a typical microstructure of bainite was produced in all the three samples. Hardness and wear resistance of austempered samples produced using <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>side</b> chills were considerably higher than the corresponding values in samples produced without using any chill and also by using only bottom chill. This enhanced mechanical property in the <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>side</b> chill sample is attributed {{to the presence of}} bainite, carbides and more of uniform fine graphite nodules...|$|R

2500|$|The Dongó's {{rectangular}} section fuselage {{was built}} around four longerons, with <b>bottom</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> covered with plywood. The rounded upper decking was light metal. [...] Its cross-section {{was determined by}} a [...] wide cockpit containing the side-by-side seating. This was placed over the lower wings but aft of the upper trailing edge, providing an excellent view both upwards and downwards. [...] The Dongó could be fitted with dual control or flown with one set removed.

At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a very upright fin and deep, rounded rudder. The horizontal tail, mounted on top of the fuselage, had straight, swept leading edges and a semi-elliptical trailing edge form with separate elevators. All rear surfaces had relatively high aspect ratios, again to minimize drag. [...] The Dongó had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, with mainwheels on half-axles hinged centrally from a transverse inverted-V strut and mounted just inside the wheels on two inverted V longitudinal struts. Its track was the wheels were placed [...] ahead of the centre of gravity to minimize the risk of noseovers.|$|E
