40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at paediatric emergency departments in Khartoum State in the period from May 2000 to May 2001. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the incidence of UTI among febrile infants;to assess the validity of microscopic urine analysis in comparison to urine culture in the diagnosis of UTI in febrile infants; to identify the most common pathogens and their drugs sensitivity, and to determine frequency of other febrile disease with UTI. Four hundred and fourty four febrile infants 290 (65. 3 %) males and 154 (34. 7 %) females, were included in this study. All relevant information was noted on a questionnaire. Urine samples were collected with perineal <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> <b>urine</b> analysis and culture. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed in (17. 8 %) of febrile infants, and it was common in male (70. 9 %). A significant pyuria (> 5 pus cells/HPF) in infants with UTI occurred in (91. 1 %), compared with (11. 7 %) in those without UTI. The main symptoms of UTI were vomiting(72. 2 %), diarrhoea(63. 3 %) and burning micturition (44. 3 %). UTI was diagnosed more commonly in uncircumcised males (98. 7 %). Esheriechia coli was found to be the commonest (68. 4 %) organism causing UTI. About seventy percent and (68. 4 %), (67. 1 %), (63. 3 %) and (62 %) of the organisms were sensitive to nitrofurantoin gentamycin, nalidixic acid, cephalexin and colistin respectively. Only (8. 9 %) and (6. 3 %) of the organisms were sensitive to co-trimixazole and ampicillin. The most frequent of other febrile diseases with UTI were gastroenteritis, malaria, malnutrition and pneumonia. This study confirmed the high incidence of UTI in febrile infants, so investigation for UTI should be routinely, and the diagnosis should be based on urine culture...|$|E
