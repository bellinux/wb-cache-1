5|$|Chocolatier was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by <b>Big</b> <b>Splash</b> Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after {{coming up with the}} premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E

5000|$|... "Don't Pull the Rope" [...] Although {{not a very}} <b>big</b> change, the <b>splash</b> {{that hits}} Moe's head after he pulls the ropes is a much <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> in season two than in season one.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, Benihana National Corporation {{went public}} with Joel Schwartz as president. Some of the {{restaurants}} continued to be privately owned by Aoki. The company had some missteps including {{the opening of the}} upscale <b>Big</b> <b>Splash</b> restaurant and a frozen foods division Benihana National Classics. Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management including the fact that Aoki still had his privately held restaurants of the same name.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 offseason {{began with}} Jim L. Mora {{taking over the}} head {{coaching}} job over Holmgren. A <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> {{was made in the}} free agency market when the Seahawks managed to land talented wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh from the Cincinnati Bengals and All-Pro running back Edgerrin James from division rival Arizona. In the draft, the Seahawks used their 4th overall pick on linebacker Aaron Curry from Wake Forest University, and sought to bolster their offensive line in the second round with 49th overall pick Max Unger.|$|E
25|$|The ninth {{match was}} between The New Wild Samoans and the Steiner Brothers. The match started {{back and forth}} until Savage kicked Scott in the face, and threw him outside the ring, where Fatu {{attacked}} him. The New Wild Samoans had the advantage over Scott until Scott fought back with a Frankensteiner to Fatu.

50|$|Hendry {{made his}} <b>biggest</b> <b>splash</b> in the 2002-03 offseason when he hired former San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker {{to manage the}} club just days after Baker's Giants lost in seven games to the Anaheim Angels in the World Series.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though he}} was a good high school and college quarterback (Tennessee), Ryan made the <b>biggest</b> <b>splash</b> in {{professional}} football.

25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Survivor Series {{included}} André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude against Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. In January 1987, Hogan {{was awarded a}} trophy for his third year as WWF World Heavyweight Champion while Hogan's best friend André was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's, for being undefeated in WWF for 15 years. Hogan congratulated his friend and said that André was the real champion of superstars all around the world. André surprisingly left the place before Hogan could even finish. In February, he came with a new manager Bobby Heenan. When Hogan came to know about that, he begged André not to keep Heenan as his manager because Heenan was Hogan's longtime enemy. André {{said that he had}} come to challenge Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania. He ripped off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden chain, turning heel. This culminated in their historic match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan defeated André to retain the title. During the match, he set a record by scoop slamming the 520-pound Frenchman. On August 22, 1987 edition of Prime Time Wrestling, Paul Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager when he came to know that Heenan had brought in a new wrestler Rick Rude to replace Orndorff. Orndorff appointed Oliver Humperdink as his manager to feud with Rude. Superstar Billy Graham got involved in a feud with Butch Reed, culminating in a match between the duo. One Man Gang interfered in a match where he hit Graham with a <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> on the concrete floor.

Ken Patera got involved in a feud with Bobby Heenan and The Heenan Family and turned babyface, and was chosen to be the fourth member on Hogan's team. Many heel managers wanted to manage Bam Bam Bigelow, but Bigelow chose Oliver Humperdink as his manager thus making his WWF debut as a babyface. He also became a part of Hogan's team.|$|E
50|$|She {{made her}} <b>biggest</b> <b>splash</b> in 1977 with the {{establishment}} take on punk which she called Conceptual Chic. She used kilts and safety pins - pre Versace - to form a sort of embroidery, mixed with loosely drawn figures screen-printed on silk jersey, or on the newly developed Ultrasuede fabric.|$|R

50|$|Gallaudet women's {{basketball}} {{made its}} <b>biggest</b> <b>splash</b> in 1999, {{with a group}} of players from the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf among those leading the way.

500|$|Tucson, Arizona based <b>Big</b> <b>Splash</b> Games {{was formed}} in late 2005 by three {{veterans}} of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this {{for a few months}} when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game, hoping that <b>Big</b> <b>Splash</b> could produce another proposal. The next morning, <b>Big</b> <b>Splash</b> co-founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, [...] "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they [...] "had {{hit the nail on the}} head".|$|E
500|$|This {{approach}} to advertising {{was driven by}} Sinclair's reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it {{had the advantage of}} ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. A <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by [...] "getting the story across", as Clive Sinclair put it: [...] "Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops." ...|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Slaughter was a {{guest on}} The Brother Love Show. He {{presented}} Brother Love the [...] "Greatest American Award" [...] and claimed that the United States had become soft and weak. He also declared war on Nikolai Volkoff. Prior to the next match, Duggan and Volkoff sang [...] "God Bless America". They were attacked by The Orient Express (Akio Sato and Pat Tanaka), and all four men fought in the ring. Sato and Tanaka attacked Volkoff while preventing him from tagging Duggan into the match; Mr. Fuji, the manager of The Orient Express, also hit Volkoff with his cane. When Tanaka missed a <b>big</b> <b>splash,</b> Volkoff tagged in Duggan, who performed several clothelines on Tanaka and Sato. Volkoff and Duggan then Irish whipped their opponents into each other; Duggan clotheslined Tanaka from a three-point stance and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
5000|$|Sam Rockwell's {{performance}} {{was met with}} critical praise, with many critics agreeing that his {{performance was}} deserving of an Academy Award nomination. MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher said that Rockwell [...] "makes the <b>biggest</b> <b>splash</b> with a sizzling supporting performance. Not only is he naturally funny, but he has the great ability to make every sharp line of dialogue sound freshly improvised." ...|$|R
5000|$|Highlights of an {{otherwise}} forgettable season included the late arrival of a big catcher from Bellows Falls, Vermont, Carlton Fisk, who got into 14 games for the 1971 Sox and hit two home runs. Making a <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> was a utility fielder who had been acquired in 1970 from the New York Yankees but came into his own in 1971. John Kennedy hit [...]272, with five homers and 22 RBIs, and was nicknamed [...] "Super Sub".|$|R
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Richard Foss {{wrote of the}} album [...] "Though nothing else on Gypsy's debut album came quite up to the {{standard}} of the opening number, the whole album is enjoyable for connoisseurs of jazzy progressive rock... In retrospect, it's {{hard to believe that}} this debut didn't make a <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> when it was first released. Gypsy's work has held up very well compared to most albums from this era, and is still a delightful listen." ...|$|R
500|$|Another {{tape splice}} occurs at 2:13, {{transitioning}} to an electric organ playing sustained chords {{set in the}} key of F accompanied by a maraca shaken on every beat. Sound on Sound highlights this change as the [...] "most savage edit in the track ... most people would go straight into a <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> hook-line section. Brian Wilson decided to slow the track even further, moving into a 23-bar section of church organ ... Most arrangers would steer clear {{of this kind of}} drop in pace, {{on the grounds that it}} would be chart suicide, but not Brian." [...] Harrison says: [...] "The appearance of episode 1 was unusual enough but could be explained as an extended break between verse and refrain sections. Episode 2 however, makes that interpretation untenable, and both listener and analyst must entertain the idea that 'Good Vibrations' develops under its own power, as it were, without the guidance of overdetermined formal patterns. Brian’s own description of the song—a three-and-a-half-minute 'pocket symphony'—is a telling clue about his formal ambitions here." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tulsa State Fair, {{operating}} in late September and early October, attracts {{over one million}} people during its 10-day run, and the city's Oktoberfest celebration was {{named one of the}} top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine.

With Gomez's $7 million contract gone, the Rangers then signed free agent Marian Gaborik on July 1, the first day of free agency. On July 16, the Rangers announced that Mike Sullivan had been hired as an assistant coach.|$|R
50|$|After the season, the SuperSonics {{were sold}} {{and moved to}} Oklahoma City to become the Thunder. Green wore the number 22, the same number he wore with the Sonics. The first season in Oklahoma City would be tough as the team did not have {{immediate}} success. The Thunder made <b>big</b> <b>splashes</b> in the draft, drafting Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka. Green averaged 16.5 points, 6.6 rebounds, 2.0 assists and a steal a game. The Thunder struggled to 23-59, leading to the firing of coach P. J. Carlesimo {{in the middle of}} the season.|$|R

[...] For months after the essay, Wolfe appeared on television and on the lecture circuit defending and debating his thesis. [...] While some critics agreed with Wolfe, others took issue with his essay, stating that he essentially had argued that other writers {{need to be more}} like himself.|$|R
