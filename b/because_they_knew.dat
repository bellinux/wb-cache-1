5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{team was}} largely that which had opposed the Claimant {{in the civil}} case, minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew, both future judges. The Claimant's team was significantly weaker; he would not reengage Ballantine, and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> {{they would have to}} present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld. Kenealy's task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown's lawyers. Other key witnesses from the civil case, including Moore, Baigent and Lipscombe, likewise would not give evidence at the criminal trial.|$|E

The Quraish, however, {{did not succeed}} in killing Muhammad, nor did they occupy the town of Medina, {{possibly}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> it was guarded by Ibn Ubayy. Rodinson suggests that the Meccans did not want to reforge the very unity of the population, which had been jeopardised by Muhammad's defeat.|$|E
25|$|The other janitor, Shawna Ornt, who {{witnessed}} the two men fleeing the parking lot eventually testified under oath that she had told the prosecutor that the man she saw {{the night of the}} murder was not Ferguson. She claims Crane repeatedly tried to get her to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> her answer would hurt their case.|$|E
25|$|The P-38's {{service record}} shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its {{employment}} than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One {{reason for this}} was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes. Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters {{because of the lack}} of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a Split S and continue into steep dives <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.|$|E

25|$|There {{were several}} reasons some Germans decided {{to end their}} lives in the last months of the war. First, by 1945, Nazi {{propaganda}} had created fear among some sections of the population about the impending military invasion of their country by the Soviets or Western Allies. Information films from the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda repeatedly chided audiences about why Germany must not surrender, telling the people they faced the threat of torture, rape, and death in defeat. Secondly, many Nazis had been indoctrinated in unquestioning loyalty to the party and with it its cultural ideology of preferring death over living in defeat. Finally, others killed themselves <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> what would happen to them following defeat. The Soviets, Americans and the British had made it clear in 1943, with the Moscow Declaration, that all those considered war criminals would face judgment. Many party officials and military personnel were, therefore, aware they would face severe punishment for their conduct during the war.|$|E
25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E

On February 2, 1921, lame duck Congressman Benjamin F. Welty (Democrat-Ohio) offered a resolution calling for Landis's impeachment. On February 11, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer opined that there was no legal impediment to Landis holding both jobs. [...] On February 14, the House Judiciary Committee voted 24–1 to investigate Landis. Reed Landis later stated, [...] "one of the other congressmen wanted Father impeached but they did want him to come down and defend himself <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> what a show it would be." ...|$|E

Entire parts of Scorpio's dialogue, such as his hammock speech, are Brooks's lines and not the writers'. Dan Castellaneta described how, after he prepared something for Homer to say in response to Brooks's new Scorpio lines, Brooks would deliver totally different lines in the next take. Josh Weinstein said Homer's reactions are exactly like someone talking to Albert Brooks. In all, his recordings amounted to over two hours in length. Brooks voiced the character Russ Cargill in The Simpsons Movie and for [...] "about a week", he was to reprise the role of Scorpio, but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea.|$|E
500|$|On March 12, 2002, Lyashenko and Martin Rucinsky were {{traded to}} the New York Rangers for Manny Malhotra and Barrett Heisten. During the 2001–2002 season, Lyashenko played for four {{different}} teams, the Stars and Rangers at the NHL level {{as well as the}} IHL's Grizzlies, and the Hartford Wolfpack of the American Hockey League (AHL). In his last season of professional hockey, Lyashenko played two games with the Rangers, and 71 with the Wolfpack. He put up the best numbers of his career in North America, with 23 goals and 35 assists. He played in the 2003 AHL All-Star Game, despite having asked for a release midway through the season to return to Russia.

Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned [...] "Why Don't You Love Me".

500|$|Developmental {{psychologist}} Jean Piaget conducted {{experiments that}} collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied object permanence by observing infants' reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented {{and then was}} covered with a blanket or removed from sight. Object permanence is considered {{to be one of the}} earliest methods for evaluating working memory. [...] An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused. Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had [...] ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> it existed, but didn't know where it was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm With Cupid" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> it would air on Valentine's Day, Fox asked the Simpsons staff to produce an episode related to the holiday. The episode's ending credits were also painted red {{in honor of the}} holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney, who also wrote the episode's first draft. The episode's title was pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who based it on the popular T-shirt slogan I'm with stupid. However, Hauge later found out that the title had already been used before for an episode of another television series. However, he did not believe that copyright issues would arise: [...] "It's a very innocent mistake," [...] Hauge said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It {{is one of those things}} that, in the course of a career, you're gonna be on both sides of that, so nobody ever sues on it." ...|$|E

500|$|Pine {{described}} his first audition as [...] "awful", {{because he could}} not take himself seriously as a leader. Abrams did not see Pine's first audition, and it was only after Pine's agent met Abrams' wife that the director decided to give him another audition opposite Quinto. Quinto was supportive of Pine's casting <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> each other from working out at the same gym. After getting the part, Pine sent William Shatner a letter and received a reply containing Shatner's approval. Pine watched classic episodes and read encyclopedias about the Star Trek universe, but stopped as he felt weighed down by the feeling he had to copy Shatner. Pine felt he had to show Kirk's [...] "humor, arrogance and decisiveness," [...] but not Shatner's speech pattern, which would have bordered on imitation. Pine said that when watching the original series, he was also struck by how Shatner's performance was characterized by humor. Instead, Pine chose to incorporate elements of Tom Cruise from Top Gun and Harrison Ford's portrayals of Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Chris Pratt also auditioned for the role.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{recruitment}} efforts principally {{targeted the}} Matabele, {{who made up}} about 20% of the colony's black population, because they enjoyed a popular reputation among whites for being great warriors; the unit was therefore originally called the [...] "Matabele Regiment". This was changed to the more inclusive [...] "Rhodesia Native Regiment" [...] (RNR) on 15 May 1916, as the ranks {{proved to be more}} diverse than expected, and included large numbers of Mashonas and other ethnicities. In particular, a disproportionately high number of volunteers came from the Kalanga tribe, a numerically diminutive community in the colony's south-west. The RNR was [...] organised largely along linguistic and cultural lines, with companies and platoons of Matabele, Mashona, Wayao and others. White officers attached to the unit were often recruited <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> an African language, or could give orders in Chilapalapa, a pidgin of English and several African tongues often referred to by whites of the time as [...] "kitchen kaffir". The ranks' diversity sometimes led to confusion when messages or directives were not properly understood. It became common for black troopers accused of disobeying or ignoring commands to claim ignorance of the language in which they had been ordered.|$|E
500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role.
