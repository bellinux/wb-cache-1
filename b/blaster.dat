5|$|On November 5, 2016, at the 20th Anniversary Fan Festa {{event in}} Ichikawa, Japan, Inti Creates {{announced}} that they acquired the license of the original <b>Blaster</b> Master game from Sunsoft, and on March 9, 2017, <b>Blaster</b> Master Zero, a retro 8-bit style remake of the original NES game, was released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop and Nintendo Switch.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2010, SOPHIA the 3rd made an {{appearance}} in the Flash game Super Mario Bros. Crossover, in its Version1.2 release. In the game, the tank possesses all abilities from <b>Blaster</b> Master and is the first character in the game to have a limited supply of ammunition; players need to collect power-ups from enemies in order to fire homing missiles, which is necessary to defeat Buzzy Beetles, Spike Tops, and Bullet Bills. The version also allows SOPHIA to grapple onto ceilings. On December 21, 2012, the game was updated to include, among other skins, a skin that changes the level, enemy, and interface graphics to those based on <b>Blaster</b> Master. According to the game's designer, SOPHIA was planned {{to be in the}} game from the beginning along with Ryu Hayabusa and Luigi, although they were left out of the first release due to time.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} {{a choice of}} weapons to use {{throughout}} the game. These include projectile weapons such as a <b>blaster</b> or thermal detonator, and the lightsaber. The player also has access to Force powers. Some are capable of causing damage to enemies while others {{can be used for}} non-violent activities.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{accessories}} for Nerf <b>blasters</b> {{are available}} separately or supplied with selected <b>blasters.</b> These consist of ammunition holders or attachments that enhance the functional or aesthetic elements of Nerf <b>blasters,</b> {{as well as}} some Super Soaker <b>blasters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nerf Rival <b>blasters</b> fire small foam balls {{referred}} to by Nerf as [...] "Rival high impact rounds". Nerf Rival <b>blasters</b> are targeted towards an older target market than Nerf's better known dart <b>blasters</b> and bows. Nerf Rival <b>blasters</b> come in two team colors red and blue and tend to fire further and more precisely than <b>blasters</b> featured in other Nerf lines.|$|R
50|$|On 30 August 2016, Kadio joined Kerala <b>Blasters</b> in the Indian Super League. He scored {{his first}} goal for Kerala <b>Blasters</b> by {{levelling}} against Chennaiyin in Kochi on 12 November 2016. Kerala <b>Blasters</b> eventually won that match with score 3-1.|$|R
5|$|The HTC One uses a 4.7 inch, 1080p Super LCD 3 {{touchscreen}} display with a {{pixel density}} of 468 ppi. The backside {{of the device}} houses the camera, the LED flash, and the secondary microphone. At {{the top of the}} device is a 0.14-inch (3.6mm) headphone jack and the power/lock key, which also functions as an infrared <b>blaster.</b> At the bottom is the primary microphone and a microUSB port for both data connections and charging; the device can stream HDMI via the microUSB port using MHL.|$|E
5|$|The game uses SoundFonts {{to provide}} {{additional}} ambient sound effects. A Sound <b>Blaster</b> AWE32 or AWE64 is required to use this feature. The player can load a SoundFont and use it for ambient sound effects. Customised SoundFonts can be created to personalise the dungeon. The game features three SoundFonts, {{one of which is}} loaded at game startup, and Creative offered sample Dungeon Keeper SoundFonts for download.|$|E
5|$|The levels {{contain a}} variety of enemies, which the player must stun, destroy, or avoid; these are {{primarily}} different alien creatures. Levels can also include hazards, such as spikes or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The game features three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. While the raygun in Vorticons killed enemies, and the stun gun in Goodbye, Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter permanently stunned them, Keen's Neural Ray <b>Blaster</b> in this game only temporarily stuns enemies, who must then be jumped on with the pogo stick to be killed or destroyed. Stunned enemies can be bypassed until they wake up again, and unlike prior games the <b>blaster</b> does not require collectible ammo, though only one shot can be fired at a time. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also items which award an extra life once enough have been collected, colored keycard gems which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the N-Strike and Dart Tag lines, {{which use}} foam darts, Vortex uses XLR (Xtra Long Range) discs [...] - green, white or glow-in-the-dark plastic discs wrapped in foam. These discs {{are capable of}} {{traveling}} at greater distances than darts fired from original N-Strike <b>blasters</b> (up to 65 feet) and also ricocheting off of walls. As with other current Nerf and Super Soaker <b>blasters,</b> the Vortex <b>blasters</b> are designed with tactical rails to accommodate scopes and other accessories. The Praxis and Nitron have accessories that are also compatible with other Nerf <b>blasters.</b> To further differentiate from the yellow-colored N-Strike and Dart Tag <b>blasters,</b> {{as well as the}} blue and orange or blue and orange and white Elite <b>blasters,</b> the Vortex <b>blasters</b> are colored kelly green and vermilion except the Pyragon, Revonix360, and Diatron, which are colored white, gray and vermilion.|$|R
50|$|In September 2011, Hasbro {{introduced}} a third sub-line of Nerf <b>blasters</b> called Nerf Vortex. The line's <b>blasters</b> fire small green, bright orange or white glow-in-the-dark discs made of soft plastic covered in foam. The Vortex <b>blasters</b> have a firing range up to 60 feet.|$|R
5000|$|All Nerf <b>blasters</b> come {{packaged}} {{with a set}} of foam darts or mega darts {{matched to}} fit into their chambers. However, refill darts are also available in packs of 16, 32, 36, 160 or 216, or with ammo boxes/bags, [...] "clip" [...] (magazine) or bandolier kits. With the exception of the Magazine System <b>blasters,</b> most Nerf dart <b>blasters</b> are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; the Magazine System <b>blasters</b> will only take Streamline darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with both regular and Magazine System <b>blasters.</b>|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto <b>Blaster.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally {{positive}} course, as {{the player}} progresses through {{the game in}} a linear fashion. The game includes most of the enemies featured in Dark Forces II, plus some new monsters. The player has access to Force powers and projectile weapons such as a <b>blaster</b> or railgun, {{as well as a}} lightsaber.|$|E
5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming <b>blaster</b> fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E
50|$|The Kerala <b>Blasters</b> {{began their}} first ever season {{away from home}} against NorthEast United on 13 October. A goal from Koke lead to the <b>Blasters</b> losing that match 1-0 to open the season. Their second match was no better as the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> lost their second match of the season to Chennaiyin 2-1. Despite Canadian {{international}} Iain Hume scoring the first goal in <b>Blasters</b> history, Chennaiyin managed to grab the victory through goals from Elano and Bernard Mendy. The winless streak continued for the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> as they headed into their third match against Atl√©tico de Kolkata. An equalizer from Iain Hume meant that the <b>Blasters</b> managed to draw the match 1-1 and thus earn their first ever point. The draw helped propel the momentum for the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> as they ended their first month of competitive football with their first ever victory against Pune City. The <b>Blasters</b> fell behind in the match early through a David Trezeguet goal in the 15th minute but Chinadorai Sabeeth managed to level the score in the 41st minute, becoming the first Indian player to score for the team ever. It was then Penn Orji who scored the winning goal in the 65th minute as the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> won 2-1.|$|R
50|$|Ghost <b>Blasters</b> at the Great Canadian Midway {{was later}} renamed Ghost <b>Blasters</b> 3D after {{utilizing}} 3D {{glasses on the}} attraction.|$|R
50|$|After {{starting}} {{the season with}} a five-game away run, the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> played their first home match on 6 November 2014 against Goa. A Milagres Gonsalves goal lead the <b>Blasters</b> to a home-debut 1-0 victory over the Goans in front of 49,517 fans at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. The Kerala <b>Blasters</b> managed to book their spot into the finals on 9 December 2014. A 1-0 victory over Pune City ensured the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> of qualification.|$|R
5|$|On May 17, 2005, Laree {{was placed}} into a tournament for the OVW Television Championship. She {{defeated}} Mike Mondo {{in the first}} round, only to lose to <b>Blaster</b> Lashley in the next round. She began a feud with Beth Phoenix on July 20 after Phoenix interrupted Laree during an interview, setting up a match on July 29, which Laree lost. Their angle continued into September, with Shelly Martinez being added to the storyline to side with Phoenix against Laree. On October 12, she appeared in OVW under her real name, and finished the year on the losing end of matches against Martinez and Jillian Hall.|$|E
5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air <b>blaster</b> placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Obi-Wan's Adventures {{is set in}} the middle of a {{conflict}} in the Galactic Republic; the antagonistic Trade Federation and the evil Sith Lord are planning to take control of the galaxy. In the game, the player operates the character Obi-Wan Kenobi as he fights the forces of the Trade Federation which culminates in a battle against Darth Maul. His weapons include a lightsaber, a <b>blaster,</b> and use of the Force. Since its release, Obi-Wan's Adventures has received mixed reviews. The game has been criticized for its visuals and controls, but praised for its sound design and creative levels.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> {{were set}} {{to take on the}} regular season winners, Chennaiyin. The first leg took place at home for the Kerala <b>Blasters,</b> the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi, on 13 December 2014. The match could not have been any better for the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> as goals from Ishfaq Ahmed, Iain Hume, and Sushanth Mathew gave the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> a 3‚Äì0 {{advantage}} heading to Chennai. The second leg took place three days later at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai. Despite heading into the game leading 3‚Äì0 on aggregate, the <b>Blasters</b> managed to concede three goals to Chennaiyin in the second leg and thus bring the game into extra-time. Just as it looked like the game was going to be settled in a penalty shoot-out, the <b>Blasters</b> managed to steal the tie when Stephen Pearson scored in the 117th minute and thus help the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> win 4‚Äì3 on aggregate.|$|R
50|$|After their three-match home stand, the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> {{returned}} to the road as the took on the Delhi Dynamos in Delhi. A 61st-minute goal from Penn Orji was enough as the <b>Blasters</b> won the away tie 1-0. Five days later, the <b>Blasters</b> returned home to take on Atl√©tico de Kolkata. Early goals from Iain Hume and Pedro Gusm√£o helped lead the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> to a 2-1 victory of the Kolkata side. The joy from the victory was short-lived though as the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> ended the month losing two matches in a row. Their first defeat occurred away from home to FC Goa on 26 November. A brace from Miroslav Slepiƒçka and another goal from Andr√© Santos lead to the <b>Blasters</b> losing 3-0. That defeat was followed with a 1-0 defeat at home to Chennaiyin.|$|R
50|$|All Nerf <b>blasters</b> come {{packaged}} {{with a set}} of foam darts or mega darts {{matched to}} fit into their chambers. Refill darts can also be purchased separately. Most Nerf dart <b>blasters</b> are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; but the Magazine System <b>blasters</b> will only take Streamline darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with both regular and Magazine System <b>blasters.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Blaster</b> Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation and location of the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two‚Äìdimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E
5|$|Palpatine's {{ultimate}} fate {{is further}} chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor {{is once again}} reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. Palpatine tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a <b>blaster</b> shot fired by Han, but his spirit is captured by the mortally-wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android {{smartphone}} designed, developed, {{and manufactured}} by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC‚Äôs seventh flagship smartphone. It is {{the successor to}} the company‚Äôs 2012 flagship model, the One X‚Äîwhich was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC‚Äôs Sense user experience, BlinkFeed‚Äîan aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR <b>blaster</b> located in the device‚Äôs power button.|$|E
50|$|Years after Cedar Fair {{acquired}} Paramount Parks, the Scooby-Doo themed dark rides from Kings Island, Carowinds, Kings Dominion and Canada's Wonderland were modified and renamed Boo <b>Blasters</b> on Boo Hill, as this ride {{is made by}} {{the same}} company and is nearly {{identical to the original}} Ghost <b>Blasters.</b> The experience for these rides are based on the refurbished Ghost <b>Blasters</b> II at Elitch Gardens with the gunfire sound effect being borrowed from the original Ghost <b>Blasters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before this match, the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> and Atl√©tico de Kolkata {{had played}} each other twice {{during the regular}} season. Their first match against each other, on 26 October 2014, ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw at the Salt Lake Stadium. Baljit Sahni scored the opening goal in the 22nd minute before Iain Hume {{equalized}} for the <b>Blasters</b> to earn the <b>Blasters</b> their first point of the season. In the second game, on 21 November 2014, it was the Kerala <b>Blasters</b> who came out on top as 2‚Äì1 winners. Iain Hume and Pedro Gusm√£o gave the <b>Blasters</b> the 2‚Äì0 lead before Fikru Teferra scored the consolation for Kolkata.|$|R
50|$|Rewind first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} <b>Blaster's</b> warriors in The Transformers: The Movie, where he defended <b>Blaster's</b> communications tower from the Decepticon cassettes.|$|R
5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, <b>Blaster</b> in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update. They felt the original format‚Äîan overhead perspective of a single screen‚Äîpresented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The moving camera angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an enemy that suddenly appeared. Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2013 in the UK (and a {{day later}} in the US), the Clash {{released}} Sound System, a twelve-disc box set featuring their studio albums completely re-mastered on eight discs with an additional three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides, a DVD with previously unseen footage by both Don Letts and Julien Temple, original promo videos and live footage, an owner's manual booklet, reprints of the band's original 'Armagideon Times' fanzine {{as well as a}} brand new edition curated and designed by Paul Simonon and merchandise including dog tags, badges, stickers and an exclusive Clash poster. Both Mick Jones and Paul Simonon oversaw the project including the re-masters. The box set came in a package shaped as an 80s ghetto <b>blaster.</b> The box set was accompanied by 5 Album Studio Set, which contains only the first five studio albums (excluding Cut the Crap), and The Clash Hits Back, a 33-track, two-CD best of collection sequenced to copy the set played by the band at the Brixton Fair Deal (now the Academy) on 19 July 1982.|$|E
5|$|Volition {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in a prompt manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of the bugs, and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to Volition removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound <b>Blaster</b> sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding contests, and expanding material for the FreeSpace universe. Meanwhile, Volition created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice clips and story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly FreeSpace stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, FreeSpace apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E
