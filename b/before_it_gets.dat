Homer stops by a road construction crew and steals a jackhammer so he can use it to remove the clamp. The car is freed from the clamp, but further damaged as a result. Homer races to Central Park and reunites with his family. While driving back to Springfield, the family reflects on their wonderful time, while Homer's hatred for New York remains.|$|E

25|$|Anthropologists {{hypothesize that}} the Syrian public {{considers}} narghile smoke {{to be less}} dangerous than cigarette smoke due to the perceived “filtration” process that occurs as the tobacco passes through water <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> inhaled. This hypothesis has become less popular following increasing prevalence of surveying and research, which show that Syrian narghile smokers are aware that water is not a reliable means of filtration. The social atmosphere and positive connotation of smoking the narghile is likely to overshadow the health concerns and make it ultimately seem less harmful than smoking cigarettes.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that a high void {{coefficient}} does not necessarily make a reactor inherently unsafe, as some of the fission neutrons are emitted with a delay of seconds or even minutes (post-fission neutron emission from daughter nuclei), so steps can be taken to reduce the fission rate <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> too high. However, it does make it considerably harder to control the reactor (especially at low power) and makes it imperative that the control systems are very reliable and the control room personnel (regardless of rank or position) are rigorously trained in the peculiarities and limits of the system. Neither of these requirements were in place at Chernobyl: since the reactor's actual design bore the approval stamp of the Kurchatov Institute and was considered a state secret, discussion of the reactor's flaws was forbidden, even among the actual personnel operating the plant. Some later RBMK designs did include control rods on electromagnetic grapples, thus controlling the reaction speed and, if necessary, stopping the reaction completely. The RBMK at Chernobyl, however, had manual control rods.|$|E

500|$|The Hi-5 brand was {{originally}} owned by its creators, Harris, and Graeme-Evans, under their joint privately owned production company Kids Like Us. Unlike peer entertainers the Wiggles, {{the cast of}} Hi-5 did not hold equity, but were rather employees of the brand.

Crawford stated, [...] "the money system has to {{go a long way}} around <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> to us." [...] In March 2008, the Nine Network, along with production company Southern Star, purchased the Hi-5 brand.

Starting in 1998, {{to celebrate the}} 40th running, individual winners of the Daytona 500 have been presented with a miniature replica of the Harley J.

Previously commissioned to craft a sculpture of Bill France and his wife, Ann France, for display in front of NASCAR corporate headquarters in Daytona Beach, Florida, Lajba's work on each replica trophy requires six weeks of 12-hour days to create the Firebird I automobile, with all the work done by hand, at Herman Engraving, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> plated in silver by A Plating, also located in Omaha.

He also found Tasuku to be a well-crafted complement, considering him [...] "an excellent complement to [...] " [...] and noting that his [...] "outgoing charm and clinginess... is surprisingly never annoying." [...] However, Janet Crocker of Anime Fringe felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine that just mirrored the life Mew Ichigo (from the original Tokyo Mew Mew) in a shorter form and she dismissed the Saint Rose Crusaders' costumes and plans as being nothing more than concepts borrowed from Sailor Moon. She also criticized the specific design used for the character Duke, whose white robe she felt was too {{similar to those used}} by the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan. Anime News Network's Carlo Santos notes that [...] "Berry has the potential to become insufferable", but felt she acted more like a [...] "typical preteen girl" [...] who was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "silly" [...] but [...] "stop right <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> annoying", thus avoiding being a standard [...] "marketable character trying to rack up charm points." ...|$|E

Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him [...] "for his past indiscretions" [...] and [...] "move on with the future." [...] In the song, Brown encourages his lover {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, [...] "You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what they saying / Because most of it is true / But it was all before I fell for you."

[...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna.
