The bond strengths of the two <b>bonding</b> <b>systems</b> to dentin (under a pulpal pressure of 15 cm of water) obtained when bovine serum was used were statistically significantly higher than those obtained when saline was used. These data suggest that the primers of these <b>bonding</b> <b>systems</b> decreased the dentinal permeability when the bovine serum pulpal fluid was used through the precipitation of serum proteins by the primers in the dentinal tubules.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of vitrified silicon carbide grinding wheels {{is dependent on}} the molten properties of their <b>bonding</b> <b>systems.</b> The erosion of silicon carbide during the manufacture of grinding wheels is enhanced by the action of high glass content vitrified <b>bonding</b> <b>systems</b> that reduces their wear resistance during the grinding process. Replacing the glass content of the bond with a clay that does not vitrify can improve their wear resistance. However, the harmful effects of quartz particles that are found in clay minerals need to be eliminated during the firing process before the grinding wheels are used to grind precision engineering components. A mathematical model describing the dissolution of quartz in refractory <b>bonding</b> <b>systems</b> was compared with experimental data using X-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that when grinding wheels were isothermally heat treated, the residual mass fraction of quartz was found to be a function of time. When compared with experimental data, the model was found to be accurate for short periods of heat treatment that are associated with vitrified silicon carbide firing cycles. The model is of practical use for predicting the complete dissolution of quartz in vitrified <b>bonding</b> <b>systems</b> used for high-performance silicon carbide grinding wheels...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} snow grain is {{commonly}} used in the snow community, either in situ to identify the snow type or in numerical models to reproduce the physical and mechanical behaviour of the snowpack. Among all possible definitions of grains (optical, crystalline and mechanical), we consider mechanical grains as particles separated by potential stress concentrators and mechanical weakness zones. To detect these grains in the snow 3 D microstructure captured by X-ray tomography, we use a geometrical algorithm based on curvature and constriction. The algorithm is parameterized with a local contiguity indicator, which defines the segmentation scale. The representation of the microstructure with grains enables {{the investigation of the}} <b>bonding</b> <b>system,</b> which is determinant for mechanical properties. In this work, we propose to quantitatively characterise this <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> with specific grain contact area, contiguity and a new parameter, the minimal cut area defined as the minimal surface of ice separating two opposite faces of a cubic sample.

Objetivos: avaliar a resistência ao cisalhamento de quatro sistemas adesivos e a densidade tubular em diferentes profundidades de dentina.

Os adesivos Adper Single Bond, Xeno III, Clearfil SE Bond e Adper Prompt L-Pop foram selecionados. As análises foram realizadas nos coposde- prova de forma vinculada e os dados submetidos à ANOVA. Resultados: Os resultados dos testes de resistência ao cisalhamento mostraram que os molares superiores apresentaram significância estatística para os fatores profundidade e adesivo, e para as interações profundidade X adesivo, face X profundidade e face X adesivo. Os molares inferiores revelaram significância para os três fatores de variação e para as interações profundidade X adesivo e face X adesivo. O adesivo Xeno III apresentou valores médios superiores tanto nos molares superiores como inferiores. A análise em microscopia eletrônica de varredura revelou aumento da densidade tubular à medida do aumento da profundidade da dentina. Conclusões: Em molares humanos, os fatores profundidade de dentina e sistema adesivo influenciaram a resistência ao cisalhamento. À medida do aumento da profundidade da dentina, a densidade tubular aumenta e a resistência ao cisalhamento diminui, porém esta relação pode ser modificada pelo sistema adesivoDentin {{at various}} depths presents different tubular density and permeability, thus directly affecting the adhesion of bonding systems. Aim: {{to evaluate the}} relationship between tubular density and shear strength of four bonding systems at different dentin depths. Material and methods: upper and lower human molars were analyzed regarding dentin tubular density at different depths by scanning electron microscopy, as well as shear strength (ISO TR 11405 method) for the dependent variables depth (surface dentin, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm), <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> (total etch and self-etching) and tooth aspect (buccal or palatal/lingual). The bonding systems Single Bond Adper, Xeno III, Clearfil SE Bond e Adper Prompt L-Pop were selected. The analysis were performed in a sampledependent way and results were submitted to the ANOVA test. Results: scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in tubular density accompanying the depth. Shear strength tests showed that upper molars present significant differences for the factors depth and <b>bonding</b> <b>system,</b> {{as well as for}} the interactions depth x <b>bonding</b> <b>system,</b> aspect x depth and aspect x <b>bonding</b> <b>system.</b> Lower molars revealed significance for the three dependent variables and for the interactions depth x <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> and aspect x <b>bonding</b> <b>system.</b> The Xeno III <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> presented average values higher than the other products, both in upper and lower molars, in deep dentin (1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0), in a regular way.

In human molars, the dependent variables dentin depth and <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> influenced the shear strength. The self-etching <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> Xeno III revealed potential maintenance of shear strength when used in dentin at different depths.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} what influence the two variables of dentin depth and age may have on the tensile bond strengths of three <b>bonding</b> <b>systems.</b> Methods. Dentin discs prepared from human molars were divided into young and old, superficial and deep surfaces. Three <b>bonding</b> <b>systems,</b> Scotchbond Multi-purpose (3 M Dental Products), Superbond D-liner (Sun Medical Co.), and Liner Bond II (Kuraray Co.) were the materials tested for tensile bond strength. In addition, the structural variation of the resin-impregnated, or hybrid, layer was compared among the two variables and three <b>bonding</b> <b>systems.</b> Results. Tensile <b>bond</b> strengths exceeding 10 MPa were obtained for all materials. After ANOVA, an effect on tensile bond strength could be attributed to dentin age or depth for only Superbond D-liner used on deep-young dentin as compared with old-superficial dentin. All other group comparisons failed to show any variation between dentin depth or age. However, specimens bonded to deeper dentin showed slightly lower strengths. SEM observations showed thicker resin-impregnated layers for Scothbond MP and Superbond D-liner compared with Liner Bond II. Liner Bond II exhibited a thinner and more diffuse resin-impregnated layer, believed to be due to the different dentin conditioning method. Significance. Dentin age or depth may not show as great an influence on bond strengths with the newer type of <b>bonding</b> <b>systems.</b> The resin-impregnated layer quality, rather than thickness, is believed to be the most important factor for obtaining high tensile bond strengths. © 1994. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
