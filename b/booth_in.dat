5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle is a 2014 nonfiction book by the British {{journalist}} Michael <b>Booth.</b> <b>In</b> the book, Booth {{focuses on}} the five Nordic countries—Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden—dedicating {{a section of the}} book to each one. He began writing the book after migrating from England to Denmark, based on his perceptions of the Nordic region before and after moving. He wanted to present an alternative perspective to the extremely positive depiction of the region in British media. The book received mixed reviews: some critics found it to be overly critical with poor humour, others praised its tone and informativeness.|$|E
5|$|The Blind Beggar is at No.337 {{and was the}} {{founding}} point of the Salvation Army following a meeting outside the pub by William <b>Booth</b> <b>in</b> 1865. On 9 March 1966, the venue became notorious after Ronnie Kray fatally shot George Cornell at the pub. The premises remains open for business, though it has been refurbished several times. The Kray Twins also used the Blackwall Buildings, by then dilapidated, {{as a form of}} punishment by locking a victim in a flat alone with Ronnie's German Shepherd dog.|$|E

Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house {{and then to a}} rendezvous with <b>Booth</b> <b>in</b> Maryland. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Deringer, and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue.|$|E

Clock Tower 3 was officially announced on April 11, 2001, with Capcom revealing they would be co-developing the new game with Sunsoft. They also revealed that acclaimed Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku would be directing the cutscenes, Keita Amemiya was in charge of character design, Noboru Sugimura was writing the scenario, and Kouji 'Cozy' Kubo was composing the music. At the time of the announcement, the game was still in the casting phase; over two hundred actresses had auditioned for the motion capture of Alyssa. The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom <b>booth.</b> <b>In</b> November, Capcom announced the game would be released in Japan on December 12.|$|E
5|$|Booth was not {{cleared for}} full-contact {{practice}} with the team until January 25, 2010.

The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with <b>Booth</b> <b>in</b> the lineup on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E

5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v <b>Booth</b> <b>in</b> 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power.|$|E
5|$|J. W. McFadden Inc. was the building's {{original}} owner. Subsequent {{owners have}} included C. C. and Leedy Maude, J. S. Middleton, Oregon Theatre Co., Mary Watt, and Ernest Bass. The theater's front doors and ticket office were altered by J. W. McFadden Inc. in 1930, {{along with the}} construction of a new ticket <b>booth.</b> <b>In</b> 1949, when the Waverly Heights Congregational United Church of Christ was reconstructing a new church building on its property at Southeast 33rd and Woodward, church services were held at the Oregon Theatre. According to the Puget Sound Theatre Organ Society, the organ was repossessed by the William Wood Organ Co. and re-installed at radio station KXL's studios in Portland. The theater's front entrance, including its doors and 1930s ticket booth, were remodeled by Ferguson Cassady Co. in 1954.|$|E
5|$|When cricket resumed {{after the}} war in 1919, County Championship matches were reduced from three days to two in a one-season experiment. Following the deaths of <b>Booth</b> <b>in</b> the war and Alonzo Drake from illness, {{as well as the}} decline in the bowling of the aging George Hirst, Yorkshire lacked an {{effective}} attack. Subsequently, Kilner was asked to deliver more overs, although not to the extent of a main bowler. He took 45 wickets, more than his entire first-class wicket aggregate before the war, at an average of 18.12. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat he scored three centuries and reached 1,135 runs at 29.10. His performances earned him a place in the Gentlemen v Players match at the end of season during the Scarborough Festival, although he neither took a wicket nor scored. Kilner's brother Norman also played for Yorkshire in 1919, although he was ultimately unable to secure a permanent place in the team.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast <b>booth</b> <b>in</b> a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
5|$|The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane {{was run by}} {{the holders}} {{of one of the}} two {{official}} licenses, or letters patent, established by Charles II in 1660. It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks. After Doggett died, Barton Booth took over his share. In 1730, a notice in the Daily Journal stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, <b>Booth,</b> <b>in</b> poor health, decided to sell half of his share to Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented his share to his son Theophilus, an actor.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the game was {{produced}} by David Baggett and Mark Mothersbaugh and composed by Josh Mancell of Mutato Muzika.

Additionally, Michael Ensign voiced Doctor Nefarious Tropy, William Hootkins voiced Dingodile and Mel Winkler voiced Aku Aku. A small sampling {{of the game}}'s levels were prominently displayed at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo <b>booth</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta, Georgia.
