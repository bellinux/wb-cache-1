40|$|ABSTRACT- Gains from {{selection}} for yield were estimated in Arabica coffee progenies carrying rust-resistance genes. The experiment in augmented block design {{was installed in}} Três Pontas, state of Minas Gerais. Three blocks were established with six plants per plot, spaced 3. 50 x 0. 90 m, in 96 regular (F 2 progenies) and two control treatments. The plant response to rust was evaluated on a grade scale in 2008. Yield (bags per hectare) was estimated in the growing seasons 2005 to 2008. Significant differences between treatments for yield were observed in all harvests, except 2005. The presence of genetic variability among progenies allowed significant gain from {{selection for}} yield. Under the experimental conditions of this study, selection for yield can be performed in the first high-yield year, without major losses compared to genetic gain from selection for yield when based on the mean of four harvests.

Germplasm screening has taken place in Uganda and Ethiopia; both countries will soon release their 1 st new bean var. On-farm research in Ethiopia studied farming systems particularly regarding farmer management practices related to weeding; in Uganda, research focussed on advantages and disadvantages of var. mixtures. Agronomy trials in Ethiopia were centered on the intensification of cropping systems (double cropping, relay cropping, simultaneous intercropping of beans with sorghum or maize) in the wetter, cooler areas of the highlands. Regional collaborative research activities covered topics of <b>bean</b> pathology (<b>rust,</b> anthracnose, and common bacterial blight) and the beanfly.

50|$|Faba <b>bean</b> <b>rust</b> has {{a complex}} {{lifecycle}} containing three different stages. Each {{stage of the}} cycle has different symptoms. Faba <b>bean</b> <b>rust</b> grows best in July and August as the weather in these months is most fit. The required environment for infection after spores land on a plant consists of rainfall or dew. Also, weather that is humid and warm promotes the spread. Spores can be spread by wind to other plants. An important factor in development of rust epidemics is the infection of volunteer faba bean plants. The disease cycle according to researchgate is as follows: the overwintering diploid teliospores germinate in the spring with metabasidium forming four haploid basidiospores of two mating type, types (+) and (-) are formed. Next haploid pycniospores are exchanged between pycnidia of different mating types on the upper leaf surface.|$|E

Origin ‘Starlight’ (evaluated as F 10 WM 1 - 85 - 43) was derived by pedigree selection from a cross of the F 5 breeding lines GN-WM 2 - 79 - 12 and GN-SK- 80 - 45.

50|$|<b>Bean</b> <b>rust</b> is {{a disease}} of the green bean that causes rust-colored pustules on the leaves. These pustules {{eventually}} rupture and eject thousands of spores into the air to be carried to other plants. Each individual spore can produce a fresh pustule on a plant within a week; therefore untreated rust can rapidly reach epidemic levels. When leaves become infected with rust they rapidly die causing defoliation.

40|$|Common bean is an economically, nutritionally, and {{socially}} important crop. It is grown in distinct regions and different seasons {{around the world}} by subsistence level farmers with low-technology input {{as well as by}} farmers that use high input technologies. One important factor that can limit the bean growing and drastically affect grain yields is the high number of destructive pathogens that attack and cause serious damage to the crop. Among them is <b>bean</b> <b>rust,</b> incited by the fungus Uromyces appendiculatus. This disease is distributed throughout the world, but it effectively causes major production problems in humid tropical and subtropical regions. In Brazil, rust causes major losses in south, southeast, and central regions of the country. <b>Bean</b> <b>rust</b> control by resistant cultivars is an easy and economical strategy to be used in association to other rust management practices. Pyramiding of different race-specific resistance genes in association with other genes conferring adult plant resistance, slow rusting, and reduced pustule size can prolong the lifespan of a common bean cultivar by creating a more durable resistance complex against the rust pathogen.

Rust phenotypic evaluations were conducted twelve days after inoculations...|$|E
40|$|The foliar rust {{caused by}} Melampsora larici-populina (Mlp) {{is the main}} disease {{affecting}} poplar plantations in Europe. The biotrophic status of this fungus is a major limitation to address in planta transcripts profiling. Thus, identification of reference rust genes steadily expressed during plant tissue colonization is a crucial point. A quantitative PCR approach to assess fungal ITS amplification profile and Reverse Transcription quantitative-PCR was set to compare candidate reference genes amplification profiles in poplar infected tissues. We selected two M. larici-populina genes encoding an alpha-tubulin and the elongation factor- 1 -alpha that showed the highest expression stability across biological samples and for which transcript levels were correlated with fungal ITS amplification during time-course infection of poplar leaves. We report {{the use of these}} reference genes to assess in planta expression profiles of two genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis (THI 1 and THI 2) for which specific haustorium expression was previously described in the <b>bean</b> <b>rust</b> fungus Uromyces fabae. Mlp-THI 1 and Mlp-THI 2 showed similar expression profiles. Trancripts were barely detectable in urediniospores as well as during the early stages of infection compared to those reported in the <b>bean</b> <b>rust,</b> whereas a strong induction was observed after haustorial formation after 24 hpi. These data are in frame with the results obtained in U. fabae and consistent with a metabolic reorientation that likely occurs after the fungus derived nutrients from its host in the haustorial structure essential for fungal biotrophy...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is given of {{the format of}} the International <b>Bean</b> <b>Rust</b> Nursery (IBRN) established during a 1974 workshop of research workers from various countries. The objectives of the IBRN are to (a) identify cv. and breeding lines resistant to a wide spectrum of the pathogenic potential inherent to Uromyces phaseoli; (b) determine the stability of different types of plant resistance by time and location; (c) detect new and more virulent rust race complexes before they, or bean cv. susceptible to them, become widely disseminated; and (d) obtain information on race patterns present in bean growing regions. The IBRN entries are evaluated for their resistance 20 - 40 and 40 - 60 days after germination. (CIAT...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{studies on}} the rust fungi of Macroptilium, Phaseolus and Vigna show that three taxa can be distinguished. The Vigna rust, Uromyces vignae, is {{maintained}} as a species distinct from the <b>bean</b> <b>rust,</b> U. appendiculatus var. appendiculatus. A new variety, Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.) Unger var. crassitunicatus J. Irwin, is described from Macroptilium atropurpureum. It differs from var. appendiculatus in having urediniospores with thicker side walls and more closely spaced echinulae. The teliospores {{are similar to those}} of var. appendiculatus, except that the side walls are thicker; the side walls are darker, with lineal rows of warts over the entire surface, and a conspicuous channel in the base; the hyaline apical thickening is thinner; and pedicels are more broadly attached...|$|E
