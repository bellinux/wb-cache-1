40|$|Over {{the past}} years, vehicle {{emissions}} {{have shown a}} negative impact on environment and human health. A new strategy has been used by automakers to reduce a vehicle’s weight which significantly reduce fuel consumption and C 02 emissions. A very light car consumes very less fuel as it needs to overcome less inertia, decreasing the required power to movie the vehicle. Reducing weight is the easiest way to increase fuel economy and making it by just 10 % can increase its efficiency 6 to 8 percent. For a normal scale 80 % of vehicles weight is shared among chassis, power train and other exterior components. Almost 60 % of the vehicles weight is comprised of steel and the remaining is with cast and extruded aluminum and magnesium alloys. Our main aim is to look for the parts like Fuel tank holder, Fuel filler neck, Turbo inlet assembly, and Brake lines, Dash <b>board</b> <b>frame</b> which are made from steel and replace them with extruded aluminum alloys, to analyze a conventional rear wheel aluminum drive shaft {{and replace it with a}} new design and with a new aluminum alloy. The current project involves dismantling an automobile and looking for feasible steel parts and making samples, analyzing the hardness of the samples. These parts are optimally analyzed using Ansys Finite element analysis tool, these parts are subjected to the constraints such as three-point bending, tensile testing, hydrostatic pressure and also torsional stress action on the drive shaft, the deformation and stress are observed in these parts. The results show the current steel parts can be replaced with 3000 series aluminum alloy and the drive shaft can be replaced with new design with 6061 -T 6 Al-alloy which decreases 25 % of the shaft weight...|$|E
40|$|A {{vision system}} that {{includes}} a specially designed video camera and an image-data-processing computer is under development as a prototype of robotic systems for visual inspection of the interior surfaces of pipes and especially of gas pipelines. The system is capable of providing both forward views and mosaicked radial views that can be displayed in real time or after inspection. To avoid the complexities associated with moving parts and to provide simultaneous forward and radial views, the video camera {{is equipped with a}} wide-angle (> 165) fish-eye lens aimed along the axis of a pipe to be inspected. Nine white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) placed just outside the field of view of the lens (see Figure 1) provide ample diffuse illumination for a high-contrast image of the interior pipe wall. The video camera contains a 2 / 3 -in. (1. 7 -cm) charge-coupled-device (CCD) photodetector array and functions according to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. The video output of the camera is sent to an off-the-shelf video capture <b>board</b> (<b>frame</b> grabber) by use of a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) interface in the computer, which is of the 400 -MHz, Pentium II (or equivalent) class. Prior video-mosaicking techniques are applicable to narrow-field-of-view (low-distortion) images of evenly illuminated, relatively flat surfaces viewed along approximately perpendicular lines by cameras that do not rotate and that move approximately parallel to the viewed surfaces. One such technique for real-time creation of mosaic images of the ocean floor involves the use of visual correspondences based on area correlation, during both the acquisition of separate images of adjacent areas and the consolidation (equivalently, integration) of the separate images into a mosaic image, in order to insure that there are no gaps in the mosaic image. The data-processing technique used for mosaicking in the present system also involves area correlation, but with several notable differences: Because the wide-angle lens introduces considerable distortion, the image data must be processed to effectively unwarp the images (see Figure 2). The computer executes special software {{that includes a}}n unwarping algorithm that takes explicit account of the cylindrical pipe geometry. To reduce the processing time needed for unwarping, parameters of the geometric mapping between the circular view of a fisheye lens and pipe wall are determined in advance from calibration images and compiled into an electronic lookup table. The software incorporates the assumption that the optical axis of the camera is parallel (rather than perpendicular) to the direction of motion of the camera. The software also compensates for the decrease in illumination with distance from the ring of LEDs...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Amount and {{vertical}} distribution of leaf area {{are essential for}} estimating interception and utilization of solar radiation of crop canopies and, consequently dry matter accumulation (Valentinuz & Tollenaar, 2006). Vertical distribution of leaf area is leaf areas per horizontal layers, based on height (Boedhram et al., 2001). Above-ground biomass {{is one of the}} central traits in functional plant ecology and growth analysis. It is a key parameter in many allometric relationships (Niklas & Enquist, 2002). The vertical biomass distribution is considered to be the main determinant of competitive strength in plant species. The presence of weeds intensifies competition for light, with the effect being determined by plant height, position of the branches, and location of the maximum leaf area. So, this experiment was conducted to study the vertical distribution of leaf area and dry matter of soybean canopy in competition with weeds and cover crops. Materials and methods This experiment was performed based on complete randomized block design with 3 replications in center of Agriculture of Joybar in 2013. Soybean was considered as main crop and soybean and Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum–graecum L.), chickling pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) and winter vetch (Vicia sativa L.) were the cover crops. Treatments were included cover crops (Persian clover, fenugreek, chickling pea and winter vetch) aDid you mean: nd cover crop planting times (simultaneous planting of soybean with cover crops and planting cover crops three weeks after planting of soybeans) and also monoculture of soybeans both in weedy and weed free conditions were considered as controls. Soybean planted in 50 cm row spacing with 5 cm between plants in the same row. Each plot was included 5 rows soybeans. Cover crop inter-seeded simultaneously in the main crop. Crops were planted on 19 May 2013 for simultaneous planting of soybean. The dominant weed species were green foxtail (Setaria viridis L.), foxtail grass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds), and red root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) in the experimental field. The other weed was considered as the others. At the soybean canopy closure stage, a vertical card <b>board</b> <b>frame</b> marked in 20 -cm increments was used in the field as a guide to cut standing plants including soybean, cover crops and weeds. In each vertical layer of canopy, leaves and stem samples were separated. The leaf area both crops and weeds were measured with a leaf area meter LICOR- 3000 A (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Stem and leaf samples oven dried. Results and discussion The results showed that the maximum leaf area and dry matter of soybean was varied in different layers of canopy {{depending on the type of}} cover crop and cover crop planting time, while delaying in planting of cover crop causes lower leaf area and dry matter than the plants were planted at the same time with soybean. In most cases, the maximum leaf area index and dry matter accumulation of weeds were obtained in primary layer (0 - 20 cm). The maximum weed leaf area (290. 4 cm 2) was observed in simultaneous planting of soybean with fenugreek and maximum of total weed dry matter (12. 4 g. plant- 1) was observed in soybean without weeding, while the minimum of weed total leaf area and total weed dry matter (0 cm 2 and 0 g. plant- 1, respectively) was achieved in planting of winter vetch after 21 days of soybean planting. Also delayed planting of winter vetch produced the maximum grain yield (3792. 6 kg. ha- 1) of soybean in weedy plots, where it had the greatest weed suppressive ability than other cover crops. Conclusion Winter vetch can suppress weed with competition and allelopathic mechanism, so we can conclude that winter vetch planting 21 days after soybean planting is suitable replacement for weed suppression in sustainable agriculture...|$|E
