40|$|Abstract. Manipulation {{of control}} points is a {{standard}} procedure in parametric B-spline surface design. Unfortunately, this tool alone {{is not sufficient to}} achieve certain goals such as removal of gaps among compound parametric B-spline surfaces. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for removing gaps but maintaining at least the geometrical smoothness condition. If the underlying knot sequences along the connecting boundaries of two parametric B-spline surfaces are proportional, they can be connected in a G 1 fashion without changing the structure of B-spline representation. Otherwise, they can still be connected in a G 1 fashion, but with one requirement, namely, by sacrificing the true B-spline representation along a <b>boundary</b> <b>strip</b> of one of the two B-spline surfaces. Our method involves manipulation of Bézier coefficients along a <b>boundary</b> <b>strip,</b> and we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by considering the C 1 cubic setting. This procedure is generalized to connecting up to four B-spline surfaces with a common corner. § 0.

40|$|Potential {{benefits}} of field margins or <b>boundary</b> <b>strips</b> include promotion of biodiversity and farm wildlife, maintaining landscape diversity, exploiting pest predators and parasites and enhancing crop pollinator populations. In this {{paper we propose}} and demonstrate a method to relocate areas of sub-efficient machine manoeuvring to <b>boundary</b> <b>strips</b> so as to optimise the use of available space. Accordingly, the <b>boundary</b> <b>strips</b> will have variable rather than fixed widths. The method is being tested in co-operation with seven farmers in the Hoeksche Waard within the province of Zuid Holland, The Netherlands. In a preliminary stage of the project, tests were performed to determine the required accuracy of field geometry. The results confirmed that additional data acquisition using accurate measuring devices is required. In response, a local contracting firm equipped a small all-terrain vehicle (quad) with an RTK-GPS receiver {{and set up a}} service for field measurement. Protocols were developed for requesting a field measurement and for the measurement procedure itself. Co-ordinate transformation to a metric system and brute force optimization of swath patterns are achieved using an open source geospatial library (osgeo. ogr) and Python scripting. The optimizer basically tests all orientations and relevant intermediate angles of input field boundaries and tries incremental positional shifts until the most efficient swath pattern is found. Inefficient swaths intersecting boundary areas are deleted to create space for field margins. The optimised pattern can be forwarded to an agricultural navigation system. At the time of the conference, the approach will have been tested on several farm fields...|$|R

40|$|One way to {{deal with}} the storage problem for the forward source wavefield in reverse time {{migration}} and full-waveform inversion is the reconstruction of that wavefield during reverse time stepping along with the receiver wavefield. Apart from the final states of the source wavefield, this requires a strip of boundary values for the whole time range in the presence of absorbing boundaries. The width of the stored <b>boundary</b> <b>strip,</b> positioned in between the interior domain of interest and the absorbing boundary region, usually equals about half that of the finite-difference stencil. The required storage in 3 D with high frequencies can still lead to a decrease in computational efficiency, despite the substantial reduction in data volume compared with storing the source wavefields at all or at appropriately subsampled time steps. We have developed a method that requires a <b>boundary</b> <b>strip</b> with a width of just one point and has a negligible loss of accuracy. Stored boundary values over time enable the computation of the second and higher even spatial derivatives normal to the boundary, which together with extrapolation from the interior provides stability and accuracy. Numerical tests show that the use of only the boundary values provides at most fourth-order accuracy for the reconstruction error in the sourcewavefield. The use of higher even normal derivatives, reconstructed from the stored boundary values, allows for higher orders as numerical examples up to order 26 demonstrate. Subsampling in time is feasible with highorder interpolation and provides even more storage reduction but at a higher computational cost. Applied Geophysics and Petrophysic...|$|E

The herbicides dichlorprop-p, isoproturon, and bifenox were applied to the plots, which had a soil water content of about 30 per cent (kg/kg). Runoff in the compressed tractor lanes occurred rapidly, whereas a total runoff over the whole plot started at a total rainfall of 14. 0 mm and the initial concentrations of dichlorprop-p and isoproturon were 1400 mu g/l. In the total runoff the concentrations ranged from 100 mu g/l to 200 mu g/l, decreasing with cumulative rainfall. In the second study, experiments with simulated runoff were carried out to investigate the efficiency of a grassed filter strip.

However, their reclamation by amendment with compost, {{as well as the}} natural reclamation of a <b>boundary</b> <b>strip</b> situated near a wooded zone, may increase mobilization risks. The effect of compost addition was studied by collecting leacheates from model constructed profiles (mesocosms) incubated for 100 days at 25 °C, under a simulated rainfall regime that mimicked the average precipitation patter of the summer months. A single layer profile of tailings was compared with a single profile of compost amended tailings and with a two layer profile: the 10 cm top layer made by compost amended tailings and the 10 cm bottom layer made of native tailings. Significantly more Zn and Tl leached from the composite profile while Pb and As were more mobile in the amended tailings (single profile). The lower horizon of native tailings was able to drastically reduce metals leaching from the top horizon. This different behaviour is coherent with a fundamental role of DOC in the mobilization of Pb and As and with its much lower influence on that Zn and Tl.

40|$|The red fox occurs {{across a}} very broad range of habitats, and {{displays}} great behavioural flexibility under different environmental conditions. In Australia, mounting concern over the impacts of foxes on livestock and native fauna has highlighted {{a need for more}} information on fox ecology under Australian conditions as a fundamental step towards developing more strategic means of managing foxes. This study explores ranging behaviour, dispersal, use of dens, activity rhythms, population dynamics and diet in the absence of management in productive agricultural land in the central tablelands of New South Wales. The study was conducted from June 1994 to June 1997 on private property near Murringo, NSW Australia (3415 ' S, 14830 ' E). The site was primarily sheep and cattle grazing land and had a history of no fox management. Rainfall was considerably below average for much of the study. A total of 83 foxes were trapped over 3931 trapnights, of which 50 were fitted with radio-collars (23 adult and 6 juvenile females, 12 adult and 9 juvenile males) and 26 released with eartags only (all juveniles: 10 females, 16 males). Thirty-three foxes were radio-tracked using fixed towers between March 1995 and December 1996, with between 11 and 28 foxes tracked at any time. Mean home range size was 446. 1 ha 69. 8 se using 95 % Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP), and 276. 4 ha 36. 3 se using 95 % kernel utilisation distributions. Male home ranges defined by MCP were significantly larger than female ranges, but no significant difference was found using 95 % kernels. Core ranges were estimated to be 133. 4 ha 23. 7 se using 50 % MCP and 59. 8 ha 6. 1 se using 95 % kernels, with no significant difference between sexes. No {{significant differences were found between}} range sizes of adults and juveniles or between years or seasons. While most home ranges were steady for the duration of the study, some foxes were observed to shift range location and 4 foxes displayed nomadic behaviour for at least some of the study. There was a high incidence of overlapping home ranges, most commonly between females or males and females but occasionally between males, but core areas were usually separate. Fully overlapping core areas were observed in 1995 but not in 1996. Juvenile foxes were significantly more likely to disperse than adults, and usually travelled further (juveniles 61. 1 km 31. 6 se; adults 5. 9 km 1. 1 se). Males and females were equally likely to disperse, and there was no significant difference in the distance travelled. The furthest distances were 285 km and 140 km, but mean distance of dispersal excluding these animals was 12. 3 km 4. 3 se (n = 13). Thorough surveys across a 16. 4 km&sup 2; area located 200 dens, with 68 of these active in 1995 and 96 active in 1996. Density of breeding foxes was estimated to be 0. 55 and 0. 52 adult foxes/km&sup 2; in 1995 and 1996 respectively based on natal den counts. Density estimates based on active den counts, which include non-breeding foxes, were 0. 91 and 1. 30 foxes/km&sup 2; in 1995 and 1996 respectively. These estimates appear lower than other studies in similar habitats but this is likely due to using a half home range <b>boundary</b> <b>strip</b> around the surveyed area in the present study. Application of mark-recapture analysis found very high 'recapture' rates of dens and gave a similar estimate of the total number of dens to that observed directly. Natal dens were regularly distributed across the study area, whereas active dens tended to be in clusters. There was a high turnover of which dens were used each year, but the total number of natal dens was similar across years (16 in 1995 and 17 in 1996). Natal dens were more likely to be used on repeat occasions than other dens, but not necessarily by the same vixen. Litter size based on sightings of emergent cubs was 2. 8. Foxes were predominantly nocturnal, with a major peak in activity about an hour after sunset. A new method of analysing activity rhythm data using Fourier series to mathematically describe animal movements was developed, that allowed systematic identification of the cyclical components underlying overall movement patterns. General fox behaviour could be clearly described by a 24 -hour and a 12 -hour cyclical component when corrected for variation in daylength. The rising and setting of the sun appeared to be a major trigger underlying movement patterns. Seasonal and sex differences were observed in patterns of activity. The annual rate of increase of the fox population was found to vary around a mean of zero between June 1994 and June 1997. A major drop in fox numbers as estimated by spotlight counts occurred in the second half of 1995, but numbers recovered by the end of 1996. Kaplan-Meier analysis of radio-tagged foxes found annual adult survival was generally very high (0. 56 - 0. 96) with lowest survival between July and October. Causes of mortality were human-related outside the site and apparently of natural causes within the site. However foxes dying of natural causes outside the site were unlikely to be found. There was no overall movement of foxes into or out of the site. Immigration was detected following the drop in fox numbers in late 1995, but there was no evidence of immigration prior to this period although emigration occurred. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the effects of a small change in life history parameters on finite rate of increase using published data as well as adult mortality data from the present study. The two most influential life-history parameters were adult and juvenile survival, while changes in fecundity and age at first reproduction had much less impact on finite rate of increase. In terms of management, in which fertility control is being considered as an alternative to lethal control, this implies that a small change in fecundity may cause less change in the rate of increase of foxes than lethal control. Foxes were culled in June 1997 on completion of the study. Estimated density using a Petersen estimate was 2. 4 - 5. 3 foxes/km&sup 2; and index-manipulation-index was 1. 4 - 3. 2 foxes/km&sup 2;. The different methods used to cull foxes appeared to target different age groups within the population, and were generally biased in favour of younger foxes. Success at killing animals was low, leading to large standard errors in the population estimates. Stomachs of foxes shot in the Orange district were found to contain predominantly rabbit and carrion, with invertebrates present when abundant. These findings were not strictly representative of the diet of foxes in the study area, where rabbits were scarce. Foxes scavenged heavily on lamb carcasses within the study site. The quantity of fresh lamb carrion removed from a lambing paddock in winter 1996 was estimated to support 13 - 24 foxes, with available fresh lamb theoretically able to support 240 - 440 foxes. Density based on removal of fresh carcasses was estimated to be 0. 83 - 1. 5 foxes/km&sup 2;...|$|E

40|$|In the 1980 s, the {{narrative}} of international migration was significantly altered in Europe. This thesis examines how this new narrative was brought about by policy-makers and shows how {{the narrative}} re-configured our understanding of international migration. Empirically, {{the focus of the}} thesis is the Inter-Governmental Consultations on Asylum, Refugee and Migration Policies in Europe, North America and Australia (IGC). These consultations are situated in the context of debates in the 1970 s and 80 s concerning ‘free-market conservatism’. The thesis argues that these debates comprised the conditions of possibility for the emergence of an 'informal plurilateralism'. Through thus far confidential memos between high ranking public servants, summaries distributed across embassies, background papers, minutes of meetings and personal letters, I trace the development of an altered discourse and {{the construction of a new}} figure: the ‘illegal migrant’. ‘Migration Management’, I argue, is best seen as a hegemonic paradigm which embodies a tool-box of mechanisms for governments to deal with international migration; introduces a distinctive way of treating human mobility; prescribes specific ways of constructing migrants, including a minority of illegal migrants who remain just outside of the European external <b>boundaries,</b> <b>stripped</b> of their juridico-political status. As such, these migrants are suspended from the community of those with a place and function. The figure of the suspended migrant points to the disappearance of the political, understood as a space where public encounter of the heterogeneous is possible. This raises crucial questions about what democracy is, how it works and how the political can be realised in a climate where the logic of necessity and efficiency has filled the space previously occupied by bipolar grand-narratives.

Our calculation is based on the q-deformed Knizhnik– Zamolodchikov approach, and the results are expressed in terms of symplectic characters. In the large size limit, we recover the scaling behaviour predicted by Schramm’s left-passage formula. We also derive a general relation between the left-passage probability in the Fortuin–Kasteleyn cluster model and the magnetisation profile in the open XXZ chain with diagonal, complex boundary terms. ...|$|R

Completeness of the eigenfunctions in the Hardy-Hilbert space is established for regular second order operators with matrix-valued coefficients when the leading coefficient satisfies a positive real part condition throughout the strip...|$|R
