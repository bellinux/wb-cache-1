5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with me <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E

5000|$|Everybody's Talking was an American {{game show}} which aired on ABC from February 6 to December 29, 1967.

[...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." [...] I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and {{recording}} Teenage Dream, [...] it didn't feel right on the record. I would've had to take out one of my other songs that [...] a nice, complete package.|$|E
500|$|As some Arsenal {{players were}} seen consoling each other, manager Arsène Wenger {{was left to}} rue the defeat and said that his Arsenal side could not take their chances: [...] "It was not a huge {{advantage}} {{for us to have}} Hagi sent off, sometimes you defend better with 10 men <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> is focused." [...] He was displeased with the penalty shoot-out and criticised Spanish referee Antonio López Nieto for deciding the penalty shoot-out to take place in front of Galatasaray fans. Wenger was also unhappy with the decision made by UEFA officials regarding a coin toss during extra time, which would affect where the spot kicks would be taken.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Mao Zedong in 1976, Benn {{described}} Mao as [...] "one of the greatest – if not the greatest – figures of the twentieth century: a schoolteacher who transformed China, released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there" [...] in his diaries, adding that [...] "he certainly towers above any twentieth-century figure I can think of in his philosophical contribution and military genius". On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao's death, Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was [...] "a great admirer of Mao", while also admitting that [...] "he made mistakes, <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> does".|$|E
500|$|I {{really started}} second-guessing myself. And then I realized, like, all right, I {{have to go}} with my gut. <b>Because</b> <b>everybody's</b> got an opinion, and so many people's {{opinions}} about me are like polar opposites. They're like, 'We love it when she does ballads, make her do the ballads.' Then they're like, 'We want to hear a hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean? I'm like, 'Stay in your lane, and I'll figure it out.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The album has {{influenced}} {{a wide variety}} of musicians, among them Regina Spektor, Bombay Bicycle Club, Gabby Young, Casiokids, The Very Best, Givers, and Vampire Weekend. The latter faced particular criticism that their 2008 debut album was too similar to Graceland, due to its origins in African music. Simon later defended the band, remarking, [...] "In a way, we were on the same pursuit, but I don't think you're lifting from me, and anyway, you're welcome to it, <b>because</b> <b>everybody's</b> lifting all the time. That's the way music grows and is shaped." ...|$|R
500|$|The White Stripes made {{exclusive}} {{use of a}} red, white and black color scheme when conducting virtually all professional duties, from album art to the clothes worn during live performances; Meg said that [...] "like a uniform at school, you can just focus on what you're doing <b>because</b> <b>everybody's</b> wearing the same thing." [...] Jack also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor. Spin magazine commented that [...] "his songs—about getting married in cathedrals, walking to kindergarten, and guileless companionship—are performed with an almost naive certitude." [...] Other affectations included Jack using two microphones onstage.|$|R
500|$|The {{next three}} seasons {{were not as}} {{successful}} as the previous three for either Thome or the Indians. In July 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of that season while helping the Indians end the Yankees' 10-game winning streak. An article in Sports Illustrated published in July 1998 commented that despite Thome's early career success (two All-Star Games and appearances {{in two of the}} previous three World Series), he was only [...] "faintly famous" [...] nationally and was not particularly well-known outside of Cleveland or his hometown, Peoria. His former teammate Jeromy Burnitz said, [...] "You can't really say he's underrated, <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> considers him one of the top hitters in the American League, but he's surrounded by so many good players, it's hard to stand out on that team." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of [...] on the Nintendo 64 in 1996, LucasArts began {{planning}} a follow-up. At the time, Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps. LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction {{was inspired by a}} level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, [...] "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> said, 'Why don't you do a whole game like that?' So we did." [...] Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.|$|E
500|$|The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department {{arrived to}} free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, {{and a few others}} were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: [...] "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> else had rioted... but the fairies were not {{supposed}} to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, {{frontman}} Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about actually picking dates, and it just ended up not working out <b>because</b> <b>everybody's</b> so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." ...|$|R

500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rodríguez-López is also {{notable for}} his recording, {{producing}} and songwriting techniques. He {{has been known}} to refuse to let other musicians in a session hear each other's parts, or the context of their own part, thus forcing them to play each part as if it's a self-sufficient song. Yet Rodríguez-López has stated that he believes Octahedron will be the final album he records in this [...] "gun-in-your-face mentality" [...] as [...] "gonna {{have to come up with}} something new, <b>because</b> <b>everybody's</b> getting used to it (2012's Noctourniquet being the last one).". He has claimed that he is [...] "ignorant of music theory" [...] and that thus he lacks knowledge in writing music in standard notation, claiming that his songwriting [...] "comes from emotion completely". Rodríguez-López claims to write all of the music for his projects, then dictates the performance to the musicians involved.|$|R

2500|$|Laudrup's {{departure}} from Barcelona {{was a huge}} blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, he commented, [...] "I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten {{best players in the}} world, you can have the best team. <b>Because</b> <b>everybody</b> talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe {{the best team in the}} world, together with AC Milan in that period." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, {{when he was}} 18 years old, Barron was {{recruited}} to the Harlem branch of the Black Panther Party by a member named Mark Holder. Barron distributed newspapers for the party, and developed an interest in politics. He studied the Third World independence movement and the ideas of African leaders as Kwame Nkrumah (president of Ghana) and Ahmed Sékou Touré (president of Guinea). Barron became increasingly critical of U.S. foreign policy. He opposed the Duvaliers in Haiti, Pinochet in Chile, Marcos in the Philippines, Pahlavi of Iran, and Somoza of Nicaragua. He recalled in 2010, [...] "It was strange, <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> I was against, America was for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period, Salvemini was initially silent about Italian Fascism, {{but as a}} deputy he soon dissented from the political line of its parliamentary group and started a lively polemic against Benito Mussolini, who he had admired {{in the past as}} socialist leader, to the point that Mussolini even challenged him to a duel, which never took place. Nevertheless, as late as 1922, he considered the fascist movement too small to be a serious political challenge. Salvemini was more opposed to old-style politicians like Giolitti. [...] "A return to Giolitti would be a moral disaster for the whole country," [...] he wrote. [...] "Mussolini was able to carry out his coup ... <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> was disgusted by the Chamber." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Butt stated [...] "I do not want to comment on The News of the World <b>because</b> <b>everybody</b> knows what kind of paper it is.

He also stated that the video can easily be edited and modified and manipulated. One day before the hearing, Butt continued to state his innocence. The tribunal announced that a verdict on the decision had been deferred to 5 February 2011 and that the ICC also stated that the tribunal would rule on charges pertaining to the third Test match between England and Pakistan. Butt was the only player before the tribunal to face these additional charges.|$|E

Other pumps failed frequently or randomly? perhaps once a year [...] from the time they were originally commissioned.

Is it <b>because</b> <b>everybody?s</b> priorities are elsewhere? Or are there perhaps elusive failure reasons, i. e., factors overlooked by all parties? Fortunately, improvement is both possible and cost-justified. Allowing repeat failures on process pumps rarely makes economic sense. Simple benefit-to-cost or life cycle analyses will easily demonstrate that the pursuit of remedial action greatly benefits users...|$|R
