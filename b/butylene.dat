25|$|In a {{standard}} oil refinery {{process known as}} alkylation, isobutane is alkylated with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propylene and <b>butylene)</b> {{in the presence of}} the strong acid catalyst derived from hydrofluoric acid. The catalyst protonates the alkenes (propylene, <b>butylene)</b> to produce reactive carbocations, which alkylate isobutane. The reaction is carried out at mild temperatures (0 and 30°C) in a two-phase reaction.|$|E

25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining <b>butylene</b> with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E

In SAAU recent studies have found that both <b>butylenes</b> and amylenes can be spent to a lower {{acid concentration}} without entering into a runaway condition. While the economics of alkylating both <b>butylenes</b> and amylenes will benefit from lowering the acid spending strength, the acid consumption of amylenes has a greater response than that of <b>butylenes.</b> Also the expected decrease in octane of alkylates produced at lower acid concentrations is less for amylenes than <b>butylenes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and <b>butylene</b> glycol.|$|E

30|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of oil {{refinery}} capacity, the production of C 4 hydrocarbons, as by-products from FCC or hydrocracking, also increases. It is reported that the C 4 hydrocarbon output of China alone in 2013 was 15.7 million tons [1]. Therefore, increasing attentions is being paid on the consumption of C 4 hydrocarbons during refinery and petrochemical processes. However, the consumption of these C 4 hydrocarbons is currently focused on <b>butylenes</b> because they can be converted for MTBE manufacturing. But the butanes, the amount of which is nearly equal to the amount of <b>butylenes</b> in the C 4 hydrocarbon mixtures [1], can only be burned as uneconomic fuels. On the other hand, with the expansion of C 4 olefin derivatives production, demand for <b>butylenes</b> increases gradually. Thus, the development of butane-to-butylene techniques and the enhancement of the C 4 hydrocarbons’ efficiency by oil refining are of vital importance [2].|$|R

30|$|Dehydrogenation of butane into <b>butylenes</b> is a {{feasible}} {{method to}} overcome the aforementioned problem [3]. The dehydrogenation process is not only of great significance for the integrated utilization of C 4 hydrocarbons made from oil refining, and broadens the feed resources for manufacturing MTBE, MMA, butadiene, synthetic rubbers, etc. It also can effectively raise the economic benefits by decreasing the amount of butanes {{which can only be}} used for uneconomic fuels with low added value.|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of the amount of}} reactive impurities in a loop reactor is of strategic importance to the propylene polymerization industry. It is essential to investigate the level of impurities in order to develop reliable monitoring and control strategies. This paper described one approach based on generation function technique with the following two steps. First, a new mechanism for propylene polymerization was proposed by considering the effects of the reactive impurities in the material on the propylene polymerization. Second, a series of equations of population balance for the propylene polymerization in loop reactors were established based on the proposed mechanism. Accordingly, the equations were transformed into the mathematic matrix through the generation function technique to investigate the effects of the reactive impurities on the propylene polymerization. Significant effects of the reactive impurities were analyzed through computational simulation. The results show that the concentration of active centre on catalysts and the polymerization conversion both decrease with the increase of the initial concentration of any reactive impurity; hydrogen concentration decreases with the increase of the initial concentration of ethylene or <b>butylenes,</b> whereas, it increases with the increase of the initial concentration of propadiene; the simulated weight average molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution index of polymer resins both increase with the increase of the initial concentration of ethylene or <b>butylenes.</b> They decrease with the increase of the initial concentration of propadiene...|$|R

40|$|As {{energy costs}} {{continue}} to increase, {{one must be}} willing to accept greater complexities in heat recovery systems. The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating heat medium loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to reboil a <b>butylenes</b> splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water. The recovered heat is used to reboil a <b>butylenes</b> splitter column and to preheat boiler feed water. Essentially, the system consists of a circulating heat medium that transfers waste heat to heat consumers.
