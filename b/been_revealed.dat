5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to Jerusalem thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{surveys of}} the site have {{confirmed}} {{that there was a}} very large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins.

The foundations have <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are still visible. Some parts of the canal can still be seen.|$|E

50|$|According to most {{scholars}} of the Islamic tradition, the chapter is a Medinan surah, i.e. it <b>was</b> <b>revealed</b> during the Medinan phase of Muhammad's prophethood. Some commentators say that verse 24 was an exception and <b>was</b> <b>revealed</b> in Mecca, {{and others say}} that verses 23-31 <b>were</b> <b>revealed</b> in Mecca. Yet others, a minority, say that the entire chapter <b>was</b> <b>revealed</b> in Mecca, thus classifying it as a Meccan surah.|$|R

5|$|The Catholic {{community}} {{responded to}} news of these plots with shock. That the Bye Plot had <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> by Catholics {{was instrumental in}} saving them from further persecution, and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them, as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year.|$|E

5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} Dreamworld {{car park}} was redesigned to accommodate more {{cars and the}} addition of a water park in the southern portion. Construction of the water park began in January 2006. In June, two of the three slide towers were complete, with several slides in the early phases of construction. One month later, several attractions were announced by the park with others being speculated upon. Some attractions were nearing completion in September and all the planned attractions had <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> by October.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contributor}} to the critical oblivion was the loss of archival documents or, indeed, the artwork itself, often dismembered if not destroyed. Only {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century, supported by new studies and the rediscovery of archival sources, has the mastery of Gasparo Cairano <b>been</b> <b>revealed.</b> While a catalog of his works of art has been reconstructed within the framework of the Renaissance in Brescia, the full story still suffers from gaps and there are still events to be clarified.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: {{a survey of}} expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have <b>been</b> <b>revealed.</b> A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s {{and led to the}} conviction of art dealer Guy Hain.|$|E
5|$|While the wrestler {{who would}} later become known as Diamante Azul has never {{revealed}} his birth name, he did unveil that he was born on December 20, 1982. Lucha libre has a long held tradition of not revealing the birth name of masked wrestlers unless they are later unmasked. Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre {{it is possible that}} he made his wrestling debut prior to 2007 under a masked or unmasked identity that has not <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> yet.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} six to seven riders from this Giro had presumptive positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those riders who tested positive have not yet <b>been</b> <b>revealed.</b> It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.|$|E

5|$|Another theory, {{which was}} {{put forward by}} early Serbian historians and has {{subsequently}} lost support in Serbian scholarship, is that despot Michael is {{to be identified with}} mid-15th-century Serbian noble Mihailo Anđelović, a brother of Ottoman statesman Mahmud Pasha Angelović. However, in-depth research of the frecoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to the 1450s, as the artistic style, the clothing and hairstyles in the portraits are uncommon for this period. Furthermore, the church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of the Morava school, which dominated 15th-century Serbian architecture. It has also <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> that in 1454–1455, Donja Kamenica was controlled by the Ottomans and in possession of a certain Yusuf, rather than part of the Serbian Despotate, and Mihailo Anđelović was never titled despot.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{initially}} titled {{this new}} work Tintin et les Faussaires ("Tintin and the Forgers") before changing this working title to Tintin et L'Alph-Art. The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, {{was based on}} a real-life art forger, Fernand Legros, whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the Paris Match. In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have <b>been</b> <b>revealed</b> had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980. Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened {{to record}} a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring {{throughout}} 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. As of 2016, Corgan and Schroeder remained the band's only official core members, though Corgan began working with prior members gradually as well, including Chamberlin as a touring drummer since 2015 and Iha in some guest appearances in concerts in 2016. By mid-2016, Corgan stated that they were considering reforming the band's original lineup, though no concrete plans have <b>been</b> <b>revealed.</b>|$|E
