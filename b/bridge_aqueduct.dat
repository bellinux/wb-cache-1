Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot <b>Bridge</b> <b>aqueduct.</b> A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, {{on the site of}} the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.|$|E

A Grade II Listed bridge carries Lockwood Street over the drain. It dates from the late nineteenth century, and is constructed of wrought iron, with cast iron balustrades.

Today, the parapet and gun positions are fairly well preserved and remain visible. The park is located south of Nebraska Avenue along Maddox Branch. Battery Kemble Park is bounded by Chain Bridge Road (to the west), MacArthur Boulevard (to the south), 49th Street (to the east), and Nebraska Avenue, NW (north). It is considered part of the Palisades neighborhood. The park is popular for running, sledding, and nature walks.|$|E

5000|$|The High Bridge Water Tower, in Highbridge Park between West 173rd and 174th Streets, {{on top of}} {{the ridge}} on the Manhattan side of High Bridge, was built in 1866-72 to help meet the {{ever-increasing}} demands on the city's water system. The 200 ft octagonal tower, which was authorized by the State Legislature in 1863, was designed by John B. Jervis, the engineer who supervised the building of the High <b>Bridge</b> <b>Aqueduct.</b> Water was pumped up 100 ft to a 7 acre reservoir next to the tower [...] - [...] now the site of a play center and public pool built in 1934-36 [...] - [...] which then provided water to be lifted to the tower's [...] tank. This [...] "high service" [...] improved the water system's gravity pressure, necessary because of the increased use of flush toilets.|$|E

5000|$|The Pennsylvania Canal Tunnel was the Pittsburgh {{terminus}} of the Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works, {{a transportation}} system that involved other early tunnels. Construction was authorized February 8, 1827, and the tunnel was completed November 10, 1829. The canal crossed the Allegheny River on a covered <b>bridge</b> <b>aqueduct,</b> later replaced by John A. Roebling's first suspension bridge, the Allegheny Aqueduct., the canal traveled underground {{through most of}} downtown Pittsburgh, under Grant's Hill, to end in a lock leading to the Monongahela River. The original plan was {{to connect with the}} C&O canal at the Monongahela River, but that canal never reached its expected western end, and the tunnel's main use was to allow overflow from the canal to enter the Monongahela. [...] Only one or two canal boats ever went through the tunnel and lock. [...] The tunnel was made obsolete by the arrival of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1852.|$|E
40|$|Limit Analysis {{constitutes}} a simplified method {{for the assessment}} of masonry historical constructions. A series of examples of application of both static and kinematic limit analysis are presented with detailed explanations so as to be used by future SAHC students and others interested in understanding the principles and operation of these approaches. A state of art on the concepts underlying limit analysis is presented as well as a selection of real case studies of different typology of structures such as a single span arch bridge, a barrel vault over buttresses, a multi-span two level arch <b>bridge</b> (<b>aqueduct),</b> the last arch in a series of arches façade, and a tower. Each case is shown in a step-by-step scheme following the sequence of assumptions and procedures followed with the use of graphic statics. The examples include cases of structures subjected to dead loading, live loading and earthquake. For each case a specific objective was defined which included verifying an experimentally known solution for an arch bridge that was tested to failure, comparing two mechanisms in the kinematic approach and finding a safe condition for the most critical one {{in the case of a}} convent church, obtaining a thrust line for the exterior buttress of a four story building, evaluating the seismic behavior for the transversal section of an aqueduct, and applying the kinematic approach for designing the strengthening with tie rods of a façade in a tower...|$|E

Vaults began to be used for roofing large interior spaces such as halls and temples, a function that was also assumed by domed structures from the 1st century BC onwards.|$|R
