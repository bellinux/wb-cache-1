40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{presented}} {{for evaluating the}} water-proofness quality of paints on lining materials. The method is based on measuring the integral capillarity in dependence on time, and then comparing this value to the value determined for the <b>basic</b> <b>lining</b> material. Measurements of the effective water vapor permeability then provide information on the risk of condensation which may increase after applying the paint. A practical application of the method is performed with four Karlocolor paints on glass concrete substrates. All the Karlocolor paints {{are found to be}} very effective materials for driven rain protection. The diffusion properties of all the paints are found to be excellent...|$|E
40|$|Production of low {{phosphorus}} steel {{using the}} {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} process is conventionally achieved by maintaining a highly basic slag. This leads to high flux consumption, generates a large volume of slag and restricts recycling of the slag due to presence of free lime. The environmental impact goes further, since the calcined lime involves depletion of a mineral resource, consumption of fossil fuels and release of CO 2. However, recent studies indicate that adequate dephosphorisation is possible in the BOF even if the slag basicity is reduced from the current practice (3. 3 - 3. 6) {{to a level of}} 2. 7 - 2. 8. Phosphorus partitioning deviates considerably from equilibrium and post stirring of bath helps in lowering bath phosphorus. Induction furnace is widely used to produce structural grade steel. Since lining is usually acidic, effective phosphorus removal is not achieved. But using <b>basic</b> <b>lining</b> reasonably low phosphorus steel could be produced...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of Cr - Ni 18 / 9 austenitic cast steel modifications by mischmetal. The study was conducted on industrial melts. Cast steel was melted in an electric induction furnace with a capacity of 2000 kg and a <b>basic</b> <b>lining</b> crucible.. The mischmetal was introduced into the ladle during tapping of the cast steel from the furnace. The effectiveness of modification was examined with the carbon content of 0. 1 % and the presence of δ ferrite in the structure of cast steel stabilized with titanium. The changes in the structure of cast steel and their effect on mechanical properties and intergranular corrosion were studied. It was found that rare earth metals decrease the sulfur content in cast steel and above all, they cause a distinct change in morphology of the δ ferrite and non-metallic inclusions. These changes have improved mechanical properties. R 02, Rm, and A 5 and toughness increased significantly. There was a great increase of the resistance to intergranular corrosion in the Huey test. The study confirmed the high efficiency of cast steel modification by mischmetal in industrial environments. The final effect of modification depends on the form and manner of placing mischmetal into the liquid metal and the melting technology, ie the degree of deoxidation and desulfurization of the metal in the furnace...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This paper {{focuses on}} obtaining the {{dependencies}} of the manganese {{content in the}} metallic base (Mno) and its interphase distribution coefficient (KPMn) on the cast iron’s chemical composition in the system Fe–C–Cr – Ni –Mn. Methodology. The cast irons containing 1. 09 … 3. 91 % С, 0. 6 … 5. 4 % Mn, 11. 43 … 25. 57 % Crand 0. 19 … 3. 01 % Ni have been studied. The active experiment design techniques were applied to build a mathematical model of manganese distribution. Cast iron was smelted in the induction furnace with the capacity of 60 kg, with <b>basic</b> <b>lining.</b> Findings. Manganese, being a carbide-forming element, distributed between carbides and the metallic base. With {{the use of the}} mathematical statistics methods, regression dependencies of the manganese concentration in the base and its interphase distribution coefficient on the С, Mn, Cr and Ni content in the cast iron were established. The manganese concentration in the base varied from 0. 37 % at 1. 09 % С, 0. 6 % Mn, 11. 43 % Cr and 3. 01 % Ni to 5. 79 % at 1. 09 % С, 5. 4 % Mn, 25. 57 % Cr and 0. 19 % Ni. The minimum value of the interphase distribution coefficient was 0. 16 in the cast iron containing 1. 09 % С, 0. 6 % Mn, 25. 57 % Cr and 3. 01 % Ni. When the КРMn coefficient values were lower than 1, manganese concentrated predominantly in the metallic base. The maximum value of the КРMn coefficient was 2. 48 at 3. 91 % С, 0. 6 % Mn, 11. 43 % Cr and 0. 19 % Ni. The manganese distribution pattern was determined by the carbides’ quantity and chromium and carbon ratio that determined the carbide type. The carbides’ composition was formed as a result of carbide-forming elements contention. Originality. Regression dependencies of the manganese content in the base and its interphase distribution coefficient on the cast iron’s chemical composition in the system Fe–C–Cr – Ni –Mn have been obtained. The dependency of the manganese distribution on the carbide forming processes has been established. Practical value. The obtained dependencies allow predicting the manganese content in the metallic base and may be used during the elaboration of the new wear resistant cast irons compositions...|$|E
