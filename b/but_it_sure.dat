[...] NOW Magazine reviewer Bryan Borzykowski {{called it}} [...] "her most modern and club-friendly" [...] album, and commented saying [...] "Jackson wouldn't {{want us to}} call it a comeback, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> sounds like one." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times [...] gave it a three-out-of-four rating, saying [...] "Its 22 tracks should be two albums: The first, a club-directed missile helmed by [...] "Darkchild" [...] Rodney Jerkins and Jackson's beau, Jermaine Dupri, could reassert Jackson's primacy among glamazon hit-makers; the second, a bedroom-bound ladies' favorite coauthored by soul dauphin Ne-Yo, would remind fans of Jackson's gift for creating truly tender smut." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E

That’s racing I suppose <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> does hurt sometimes.” After finishing in 26th, Webber said it had been an tough event for his team and revealed that they were confident that they could have battled for the victory had his car not sustained two punctured tyres: [...] "It just goes to show how hard endurance racing can be. We’re all right on the limit and as we’ve seen here that’s causing quite a high rate of attrition. Third time lucky at Le Mans is the plan." [...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle. The {{chief executive officer of the}} World Endurance Championship Gerard Neveu {{described the}} event as [...] "a great day for motorsport" [...] but felt that it was slightly strange. He revealed that after the race, he had organised a meeting with several people and raised the question of why [...] "there was so much aggression and action in Spa. It's quite simple: the cars are all so close together, the competition is so hard as never before. It can happen at any time - that is exciting...".|$|E

[...] The Gators' senior quarterback, Steve Spurrier, had just locked up the Heisman trophy the previous week with a stellar performance versus the Auburn Tigers. [...] The Florida–Georgia game turned out very differently, however, as the Bulldogs defense dominated the game, and Spurrier threw three interceptions in the 27–10 Georgia victory. [...] All-American defensive tackle Bill Stanfill would later reference Spurrier in recounting his experiences growing up on a farm in southwest Georgia before the advent of weightlifting: [...] "Holding pigs for my dad to castrate was quite a challenge.

The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country.

Murray said of Darville that [...] "She was a young girl, and her book mightn't have been the best in the world, but it was pretty damn good for a girl of her age [...] And her marketing strategy of pretending to be a Ukrainian might have been unwise, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> did expose the pretensions of the multicultural industry". Biographer Alexander writes that in his poem [...] "A Deployment of Fashion", Murray linked [...] "the attack on Darville with the wider phenomenon of attacks on those judged outcasts (from Lindy Chamberlain to Pauline Hanson) by society’s fashion police, the journalists, academics and others who form opinion (p.282).

[...] He {{went on to}} note that the craftsmanship of the song was of a high standard. Steve Leftridge of PopMatters called [...] "California Gurls" [...] the radio jam of the summer of 2010 and [...] "the gargantuan singalong fantasy that delivered on the promise built by the disco thump of hits like 'I Kissed a Girl' and 'Hot n Cold'." [...] Leftridge also praised the song's musical composition, lyrical content and its chorus which he said [...] "you know by heart halfway through your first listen." [...] The track was deemed as a highlight on Teenage Dream by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. Michael Cragg of musicOMH praised the song, [...] "First single California Gurls is brilliant, brattish fun, Perry sounding sweet and coy on the verses before that huge chorus erupts". Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that the track is [...] "an effervescent toast to summer fun." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune, however, dismissed the song as [...] "relentlessly mechanical". He went on to describe Perry's vocal performance on the song as [...] "a series of syllables digitally stitched together." [...] The single received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. On May 25, 2012, Billboard ranked the song number one on a special The 30 Summer Songs of All Time listing.|$|E
2500|$|The I Am... World Tour {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! gave Knowles' [...] "spectacular" [...] performance 4.5 out of 5 stars stating that she proved she could sing traditional R {{if she wanted}} with the cover of Etta James' [...] "At Last". He further noted that the show had [...] "high-production bells... {{a wide range of}} musical styles... a remarkable vocal range, and of course the riveting presence of the star herself." [...] Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, [...] "Beyoncé doesn't really need the bells and whistles of a big stadium show, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> makes for an unforgettable concert." [...] Additional praise was received from Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press who graded her [...] "lavishly produced" [...] performance 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "In Sasha-mode... Knowles is raw energy convincingly expressing a live hard/work hard ethos with every shimmy and nimble vocal trill... But Beyoncé... showed feeling ... with more ballad-y numbers" [...] further noting that her split-personality [...] "bounces back and forth" [...] throughout the show. Alice Jones of The Independent noted that whether Knowles performed power balladry, dancehall or electro songs, [...] "she sings her heart out" [...] and further praised the [...] "astonishingly high-energy show, the ambitious choreography barely grazing her perfect, lung-busting vocals which run from caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn". She concluded her review by saying, [...] "Watching Beyoncé sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating. She takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes, [...] "there is a breathtaking elegance in her acute desire to entertain" [...] further saying that [...] "the whole point of the dazzling show was to make you ask how she does it. Not just physically, but organizationally." [...] Ratliff also praised Knowles' [...] "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference." [...] Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of The Belfast Telegraph described the show as [...] "incredible... mind blowing... electrifying". [...] A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote that Knowles proved she was the best entertainer [...] "with a two-hour set packed with bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm", further praising her for singing the songs live [...] "hit every note" [...] while dancing to her choreography. The writer further chose the performances of [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights during the show describing Knowles' vocals as [...] "incredible". Similarly, Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times chose the same songs as highlights during the show, further saying that [...] "Halo" [...] was the most memorable moment of the night. She also praised Knowles' [...] "enviable" [...] dancing skills, compared her with Dionne Warwick but noted that, [...] "Her brilliant performance, which was only let down by weaker, less melodic songs such as Get Me Bodied or Upgrade U, was matched by spectacular production and audio visuals." [...] Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger also wrote that [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] were as [...] "riveting as anything that had come before", further choosing the performances of [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as other highlights. Lustig described the show as a [...] "bona fide pop spectacle" [...] noting that many of the songs which were performed had futuristic themes. Jim Farber from the Daily News viewed the tour as [...] "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" [...] and added that [...] "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point".|$|E
