40|$|Background: Schistosomiasis {{and soil}} {{transmitted}} infection {{is a major}} health problem of children from rural areas of developing countries including Yemen. In an attempt to reduce this burden, the Ministry of Public Health and Population in Yemen established in 2002 a programme for Schisto­somal, soil transmitted infection control that aimed to reduce morbidity and prevalence rates of Schistosomiasis, and Soil transmitted helminthes to less than 5 % by 2015. The {{study was conducted to}} assess the current prevalence and intensity of schistosomal infection among schoolchildren in ru­ral areas of the Taiz governorate after 6 years of running National Control Programme. Methods: Grade 3 schoolchildren from Shara’b Al-Raona district of Taiz Governorate were ex­amined for infections with Schistosoma mansoni using Modified Kato–Katz method and S. haematobium applying filtration method in 1998 / 1999, comparing the prevalence and intensity of infection with <b>base</b> <b>line</b> <b>study,</b> which was done 6 years ago.

These studies have followed the beds from post construction through unplanted hydraulic <b>base</b> <b>line</b> <b>studies</b> to the current status of mature stands of Phragmites australis. Experimental observations indicate that in unplanted beds, daily thermal fluctuations are depth dependent and range from 1 to 9 degrees Celsius. These fluctuations result in daily thermal inversions, and enhanced mixing and oxygen transport. For planted beds, thermal fluctuations are depth independent, and have a constant amplitude of 2 degrees Celsius. Planted beds may be thermally stratified. Lithium tracer studies corroborate these results for the planted bed. In addition, performance studies indicate that organic pollutant removal is probably limited to organic suspended solids removal, with subsequent biological breakdown.

However, access to safe water is becoming increasingly difficult {{in many parts of the}} world, and this can lead {{to the production of}} fresh produce contaminated with pathogenic micro-organisms, resulting in increased risk of human disease. Water, an important raw material in the fresh produce chain, is used in considerable amounts in many operations, including irrigation and application of pesticides and fertilizers, but also as a transport medium and for cooling and washing in postharvest practices. In several reported outbreaks related to uncooked fruit and vegetable products, water has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak.

Specifically, in the Peruvian Andes spatially and temporally coherent precipitation information {{is a prerequisite for}} ongoing climate change adaptation projects in the fields of water resources, disasters and food security. The present work aims at evaluating the ability of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) to estimate precipitation rates at daily 0. 25 ° × 0. 25 ° scale in the Central Andes and the dependency of the estimate performance on changing spatial and temporal resolution. Comparison of the TMPA product with gauge measurements in the regions of Cuzco, Peru and La Paz, Bolivia were carried out and analysed statistically. Large biases are identified in both investigation areas in the estimation of daily precipitation amounts. The occurrence of strong precipitation events was well assessed, but their intensities were underestimated. TMPA estimates for La Paz show high false alarm ratio. The dependency of the TMPA estimate quality with changing resolution was analysed by comparisons of 1 -, 7 -, 15 - and 30 -day sums for Cuzco, Peru. The correlation of TMPA estimates with ground data increases strongly and almost linearly with temporal aggregation. The spatial aggregation to 0. 5 °, 0. 75 ° and 1 ° grid box averaged precipitation and its comparison to gauge data of the same areas revealed no significant change in correlation coefficients and estimate performance. In order to profit from the TMPA combination product on a daily basis, a procedure to blend it with daily precipitation gauge measurements is proposed. Different sources of errors and uncertainties introduced by the sensors, sensor-specific algorithm aspects and the TMPA processing scheme are discussed. This study reveals the possibilities and restrictions of the use of TMPA estimates in the Central Andes and should assist other researchers in the choice of the best resolution-accuracy relationship according to requirements of their applications...|$|R

The Eco lodges in the rainforest areas are more popular than the others but the high humidity level courses discomfort to the nature lovers. According to climate experts, the temperature of rainforest regions varies from 15 oC - 30 oC throughout the year and the relative humidity varies 70 % to 95 % which is on the higher side. The high humidity disrupts the ability of the human body to cool itself, which may lead to a heat stroke. Exceptionally high humidity can also trigger asthma symptoms. Another unpleasant effect of high humidity is the appearance of mold. High humidity makes it easier for molds to reproduce, and they can appear virtually anywhere, damaging whatever they grow upon.

The nonreceptor kinases are lck, yes, abl, arg, JakI, tyk 2, and etk/bmx. Most of the dual kinases are in the mitogen-activating protein (MAP) kinase-kinase (MKK) family, which includes MKK 3, MKK 4, MEK 5, and a novel one. As a complementary approach, we also analyzed by specific reverse transcriptase-PCR primers the expression profile of erbB/epidermal growth factor receptor family receptors {{in a variety of}} PCA specimens, cell lines, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. We found that erbB 1, - 2, and - 3 are often coexpressed in prostate tissues, but not in erbB 4.

40|$|In this study, we {{critically}} {{examine whether}} contextual social capital (CSC) {{is associated with}} self-rated health, {{with an emphasis on}} the problem of confounding. We also examine different components of CSC and their association with self-rated health. Finally, we look at differences in susceptibility between different socio-demographic groups. We use the cross-sectional <b>base</b> <b>line</b> <b>study</b> of the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, conducted in 2002. A postal questionnaire was answered by 31, 182 randomly selected citizens, 18 - 84 years old, in Stockholm County. We used four measures of social capital: horizontal (civic trust and participation), vertical (political trust and participation), cognitive (civic and political trust) and structural (civic and political participation). CSC was measured at parish level from aggregated individual data, and multilevel regression procedures were employed. We show a twofold greater risk of poor self-rated health in areas with very low CSC compared with areas with very high CSC. Adjustments for individual socio-demographic factors, contextual economic factors and individual social capital lowered the excess risk. Simultaneous adjustment for all three forms of confounding further weakened the association and rendered it insignificant. Cognitive and structural social capital show relatively similar associations with self-rated health, while horizontal CSC seems to be more strongly related to self-rated health than vertical CSC. In conclusion, whether there is none or a moderate association between CSC and self-rated health, depends {{on the extent to which}} individual social capital is seen as a mediator or confounder. The association with self-rated health is similar independent of the measure of CSC used. It is also similar in different socio-demographic groups.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} training of dispensers {{on the process of}} case management of ARI at community pharmacies in context to history taking and provision of advice working at community pharmacies in Islamabad, Pakistan. Method: A randomized, controlled, blinded intervention study was designed and implemented. Before the implementation of intervention, a baseline study was performed to assess the process of case management for ARI at community pharmacies. The study population included all community pharmacy outlets in Islamabad. After data collection, data was analyzed. The result of the study revealed that the overall process of disease management of ARI at community pharmacies in Pakistan is not satisfactory. Pharmacies of Islamabad which were visited in pre intervention phase (118) were divided into two geographical regions A (intervention) and B (control). From which thirty pharmacies were selected randomly from each region. The targeted group of the interventions was drug sellers. Keeping in view the results of the <b>base</b> <b>line</b> <b>study</b> an educational intervention was designed to improve the case management of ARI at community pharmacies in Pakistan. Results: No significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) was seen in the process of history taking and advice provision in case of ARI management at community pharmacies between pre and post control groups. On the other hand significant difference in the process of history taking and provision of advice for ARI was observed in the intervention group before and after training. Conclusion: The study has highlighted that improvements in the current dispensing practices at community pharmacies are possible through appropriate educational interventions. The dispensers have the potential to provide fast and low cost healthcare to the masses in the country where the presence of doctors and qualified pharmacist is low; to date they are an untapped and underutilized source in the country...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{sustainable}} {{viability of}} a mineral enterprise depends on improving the concentrate quality, generating readily salable by-products, improving recovery, throughput, and reduction of unit cost rate and maximize the unit income rate and thereby unit profit rate. Closing down of iron ore mines due to environmental constraints spurred the captive iron ore washing plants to workon a custom plant mode and also recover the values from their slimy tails. This paper enumerates the difficulties faced by a captive iron ore fine washing plant [treating iron ore fines assaying Fe∼ 58 % yielding sands assaying Fe> 60 %] due to raw material change yielding unsalable sands {{and discuss the}} importance of process plant audit for improving the mineral processing plant performance. Based on the <b>base</b> <b>line</b> <b>study,</b> laboratory tests on typical samples followed by short term modifications, retrofitting of downstream slime concentrating wet high intensity magnetic separators and dewatering of products could produce readily salable sinter grade [Fe> 60 %] and pellet grade[Fe> 62. 5 %] with an overall increase of concentrate yield by 11. 5 %. Even the previous wash plant tails [which assayed Fe > 45 %] may be reprocessed in the retrofitted slime processing VPWHIMS plant. The final tails assayed 38. 60 % Fe at weight % yield of 28. 5. Efforts are on for utilizing the above tails in bricks- tiles manufacture. Also, R&D efforts to concentrate Fe values from above 38. 60 % Fe tails by Magnetizing roast followed by magnetic separations in bench scale has given encouraging results. Thus auditing not only improved the quality, quantity and rate of production of concentrate but mitigated the problem of tailing disposal. The investments were repaid {{within a year of}} operation and unit operating costs reduced by 20 % with reference to base line data...|$|E
40|$|Common bean, one of {{the most}} {{important}} legumes for human consumption, may have drastic reduction in yield due to anthracnose, a disease caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. Rapid induction of the plant defense mechanisms is essential to establish an incompatible interaction with this pathogenic fungus. In this study, we evaluated spatial (leaves, epicotyls and hypocotyls) and temporal (24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after inoculation [HAI]) relative expression (RE) of 12 defense-related transcripts selected from previously developed ESTs libraries, during incompatible interaction between the resistant common bean genotype SEL 1308 and the avirulent anthracnose pathogen race 73, using real time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. All selected transcripts, including the ones coding for pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (PR 1 a, PR 1 b, PR 2, and PR 16 a and PR 16 b) were differentially regulated upon pathogen inoculation. The expression levels of these transcripts were dependent on the tissue and time post inoculation. This study contributes to a better understanding of the kinetics of induced defenses against a fungal pathogen of common bean and may be used as a <b>base</b> <b>line</b> to <b>study</b> defenses against a broad range of pathogens including bacteria as well as non-host resistance.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of electrons from semi-leptonic decay of heavy flavor in p+p collisions at √(s) = 200 GeV {{has been carried}} out with the PHENIX detector in the RHIC Year- 2005 and Year- 2006 run. This measurement provides a good test of the perturbative QCD and the important <b>base</b> <b>line</b> to <b>study</b> the medium created in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The behavior of bottom in the medium is expected to be largely different from that of charm. Therefore, the determination of the fraction of bottom in the electrons from heavy flavor is necessary to understand the behavior of heavy quarks in the matter. The first separate {{measurement of}} charm and bottom via partial reconstruction of D/D̅→ e^± K^∓ X decay {{has been carried out}} in p+p collisions. It is found that there is the considerable contribution from bottom in the electrons from heavy flavor above 3 GeV/c. The total cross section of bottom is also determined to σ_bb̅= 3. 2 ^+ 1. 2 _- 1. 1 (stat) ^+ 1. 4 _- 1. 3 (sys) μ b. It is found that the perturbative QCD predictions of charm and bottom production are consistent with the measurement of charm and bottom at PHENIX. In addition, this result indicates the not only charm but also bottom quarks lose a large fraction of their energy in the medium. Comment: 260 pages, 188 figures, doctor thesi...|$|R
40|$|Quiescent cottonseeds {{stored in}} a dry, {{anaerobic}} situation {{for over a year}} have been shown to contain cells whose contents are ultrastructurally similar to those of normal, fully hydrated plant cells. Plastids, mitochondria, and nuclei of the cells of cotyledon tissue in dry seeds possess normal-looking double membranes even under conditions of extreme desiccation. Previous reports have indicated on the basis of light microscopic work, that the cells of certain dry seeds do not possess nuclear membranes or mitochondria. The cells of the dry cottonseed do contain these structures, however. Dictyosomes have not been observed in the spongy parenchymal cells of the cotyledon tissue; it is suggested that they are concerned with translocation and/or utilization of material. The storage materials in the cells, protein and oil, are contained in vacuolar areas enclosed by a single membrane. Seeds offer a convenient <b>base</b> <b>line</b> in ontogenetic <b>studies</b> of the plant.
