The family Lauraceae, which derives {{its name from the}} prominent member, the Grecian laurel, Laurus nobilis, is characterized by plants which have prominent oil cells in the leaves, wood and fruit. These oils are mostly aromatic, hence provide a number of flavoring materials and spices. Among the more prominent species in the family, cinnamon, derived from the bark of the Asiatic species, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, is possibly the most widely utilized botanical relative of the avocado. This ancient spice was used in Asia long before it became known in Europe. It is chiefly produced in Ceylon {{and to a lesser extent}} in India, Malaya and tropical America. The "quills " of commerce are sections of the inner bark which are dried and scraped free of the epidermis. The Chinese cinnamon or Cassia is an essence distilled from the bark of Cinnamomum cassia. Saigon cassia and <b>Batavia</b> <b>cassia</b> are perfumery oils derived from other species of the genus...|$|E
