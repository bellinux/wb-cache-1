5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of Catalan nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for Catalan separatism. The politicalisation of the club drew criticism from several club members who accused Laporta of alienating Barcelona fans, <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside of Catalunya. By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, and in turn the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E

5|$|Generally the whorls of {{the shell}} {{increase}} rather regularly in size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite different degrees of whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions {{of the shell}} vary greatly <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|In the 1892 election, South Carolinians {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into {{both houses of}} the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before the House bill could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal {{in the form of}} an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.|$|E
5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E

As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> adjacent to the empire, from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran, to Central Asia and China, to Alaska (Russian America).|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former Soviet Union {{has been relatively}} slight, although Alfred Schnittke took up his eclecticism and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E

5|$|Taiko have a mythological {{origin in}} Japanese folklore, but {{historical}} records suggest that taiko {{were introduced to}} Japan through Korean and Chinese cultural influence {{as early as the}} 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the Kofun period. Their function has varied through history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, and religious ceremony to both festival and concert performances. In modern times, taiko have also {{played a central role in}} social movements for minorities <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of al-Azhar is {{closely tied to}} the history of Cairo. Materials taken from multiple periods of Egyptian history, from the Ancient Egyptians, through Greek and Roman rule, to the Coptic Christian era, were used in the early mosque structure, which drew on other Fatimid structures in Ifriqiya. Later additions from the different rulers of Egypt likewise show influences from <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside of Egypt. Sections of the mosque show many of these influences blended together while others show a single inspiration, such as domes from the Ottoman period and minarets built by the Mamluks.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} {{between males and}} females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside their core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with {{only a couple of}} conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August, {{with his}} forces encircled, Model {{organised}} {{attacks on the}} Polish position from <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside the pocket. The Germans managed to isolate the ridge and force open a narrow escape corridor. Lacking the fighting power to close the corridor, the Poles nevertheless directed constant and accurate artillery fire on German units retreating from the pocket, causing heavy casualties. Exasperated, the Germans launched fierce attacks throughout 20 August which inflicted losses on Hill 262's entrenched defenders. Exhausted and dangerously low on ammunition, the Poles managed to retain their foothold on the ridge. The following day, less intense attacks continued until midday, when the last German effort to overrun the position was defeated at close quarters. The Poles were relieved by the Canadian Grenadier Guards shortly after noon; their dogged stand had ensured {{the closure of the}} Falaise pocket and the collapse of the German position in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} new castles emerged that made keeps unnecessary. One such design was the {{concentric}} approach, involving exterior walls guarded with towers, and perhaps supported by further, concentric layered defenses: thus castles such as Framlingham {{never had a}} central keep. Military factors may well have driven this development: R. Brown, for example, suggests that designs with a separate keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co-ordinated and combined defensive system, and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough, a keep became militarily unnecessary. In England, gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged {{the need for a}} keep in the same castle. The classic Edwardian gatehouse, with two large, flanking towers and multiple portcullises, designed to be defended from attacks <b>both</b> <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside the main castle, has been often compared to the earlier Norman keeps: some of the largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason.|$|E
