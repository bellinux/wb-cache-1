We {{prove that}} for a sequence of times, they decompose as a sum of decoupled harmonic maps in the light cone, and a smooth wave map (in the <b>blow</b> <b>case)</b> or a linear scattering term (in the global case), up to an error which tends to 0 in the energy space. 1...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} direct coal liquefaction work using the Short Contact Time Batch Reactor (SCTBR) {{we have had}} recovery of product of approximately 75 to 85 % due to hold up of the reaction mixture in the preheater, precooler {{and also in the}} <b>blow</b> <b>case.</b> This has forced us to determine conversion by use of aliquots and using an ash balance. This has worked out quite well when we were running coal liquefaction reactions without catalyst or were using small amounts of soluble catalyst which did not leave significant amounts of mineral matter in the product. Now however, we are interested in running catalyzed liquefactions with solid and often supported catalysts which contribute significant amounts of mineral matter to the reaction system, thereby reducing the precision of the conversion determination. It therefore has been important to develop a method of determining conversion by other means. To do this, we have redesigned the reactor system to increase the recovery by reducing the hold up of material in the system. This was done by redesigning the <b>blow</b> <b>case</b> so {{there is little or no}} bypassing of the compressed gas used to drive the reaction mixture into the reactor, by changing the condenser system so that there is less hold up of material there, and to reduce the length of the tubing in the preheater and precooler. With these changes, we have been able to increase our recovery to over 90 to 95 %. This should permit a more accurate determination of conversion by product material balance provided one determines the amount of tetralin solvent in the recovered liquid product and the solids content in that product. The solids content is determined by filtration and weighing of the insoluble material. For the tetralin content, a gas chromatographic method on the liquid portion of the reaction mixture has been developed, using methyl naphthalene as the reference standard. A basket is being fabricated to hold catalyst in the SCTBR reactor during liquefaction. This is designed to hold the solid catalyst in the reaction mixture during the reaction, but be able to be recovered after rinsing with the solvent for studies of catalyst activity and changes that may have taken place. This should allow the testing of various solid catalysts for activity and to separate them from the reaction mixture after the reaction is finished so that the high mineral matter catalyst will not interfere with the conversion determination. Various catalyst compositions both coated and uncoated will be tested. The first basket that was fabricated needed to be modified. That modification is in progress, but further modifications may be required as the system is tested...|$|E

40|$|Wingtip vortices, {{created as}} a {{byproduct}} of lift, are both a hazard and a significant limiting factor in the increase of air traffic. In order to reduce separation distances between airplanes and increase safety, active flow control solutions are considered, however, more research is required {{to better understand the}} behavior of wingtip vortices. Therefore, this research focuses on the modification of the flow structure downstream using pulsed jets, visualization of the behavior of wingtip vortices using two dimensional particle image velocimetry, as well as measurements of the forces and moments affected by the pulsed jets using an aerodynamic balance. A NACA 0012 wing model equipped with two slots was mounted in a wind tunnel at approximately 150, 000 Reynolds number. A valve system was designed to create jets of air at the wing tip in a steady or pulsed pattern from a slot placed either on the pressure side or the suction side. Particle image velocimetry measurements were taken at various distances downstream, and post-processed for the characterization of the vortex : position, angle, distance, vorticity contour, and circulation. Results indicate that the vortex can be forced into a cyclic pattern constrained between the baseline (no jet) vortex core position, and the position when the jet is permanently activated (steady <b>blowing</b> <b>cases).</b> Depending on the slot used, the vortex trajectory can be forced into an inclination angle. Steady <b>blowing</b> <b>cases</b> show near-sinusoidal oscillations, while pulsed <b>blowing</b> <b>cases</b> exhibit a steady rise in angle, with a slight oscillating pattern in displacement distance values. The circulation values are significantly changed, with a significantly higher dispersion than for the baseline case. Furthermore, the vortex core size is consistently larger as it is displaced away from the baseline case. Additionally, lift, drag and pitching moment were measured in a wind tunnel using an aerodynamic balance. Results showed that lift/drag coefficients consistent with published results, and that activating the jets on the pressure or suction side decreased lift. As instability grows, the destruction of the wingtip vortices occurs past the maximum downstream distance studied, therefore, additional PIV measurements should be taken further downstream. Moreover, supplementary PIV measurements at the slot themselves should be considered to better understand how the perturbed flow structure interacts with the pulsed jets...|$|R

Appropriate transformations are used to transform the governing boundary layer equations into non-linear ordinary differential equations, before being solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. The effect of the governing parameters on the dimensionless velocities, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction (concentration), density of motile microorganisms {{as well as on}} the local skin friction, local Nusselt, Sherwood number and motile microorganisms numbers are thoroughly examined via graphs.

For baseline case, POD results clearly distinguish the primary mode containing most of flow energy from the rest of flow modes (2 - 9 mode) depicting small scale modes. Also, the increase in the energy of flow modes 2 - 5 is responsible for the formation of relatively large scale structures due to diaphragm.

Two types of sweeping jet actuators were fabricated using rapid prototype techniques, and directed over a 15 % chord simple-hinged flap. The model was configured for low-speed high-lift testing with flap deflections of 30 deg and 60 deg, and a transonic cruise configuration having a 0 deg flap deflection. For the 30 deg flap high-lift configuration, the sweeping jets achieved comparable lift performance in the separation control regime, while reducing the mass flow by 54 % as compared to steady blowing. The sweeping jets however were not effective for the 60 deg flap. For the transonic cruise configuration, the sweeping jets reduced the drag by 3. 3 % at an off-design condition.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} {{radiation}} on MHD free convection from a cylinder with partial slip in a Casson fluid in non-Darcy porous medium is investigated. The surface of the cylinder is heated under constant surface temperature with partial slip. Partial slip factors are considered on the surface for both velocity and temperature. The boundary layer equations are normalized into a system of non-similar partial differential equations and are then solved using a bi-variate quasilinearization method (BQLM). The boundary layer velocity and temperature profiles are computed for different values of the physical parameters. Increasing the Forchheimer parameter decreases the temperature profiles. The decrease of the velocity profiles {{with the increase in}} magnetic parameter is more enhanced {{in the presence of the}} velocity slip factor. Increasing the Eckert number increases the temperature profiles in both suction and <b>blowing</b> <b>cases.</b> This study considers the unique problem of the effect of transpiration in a Casson fluid in the presence of radiation, a magnetic field, and viscous dissipation.

Blowing was applied at the quarter-chord location during sinusoidal pitching oscillations described by alpha = alpha(sub m) + 10 deg sin omega t. Results were obtained for a Reynolds number of 1 x 10 (exp 5), mean angles of 10 and 15 deg, reduced frequencies ranging from 0. 005 to 0. 15, and blowing rates from C(sub mu) = 0. 16 to 0. 66. Unsteady lift, drag, and pitching moment loads are reported, along with fluorescent-dye flow visualizations.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of steady and pulsed blowing {{as a method}} of controlling delta wing vortices during ramp pitching has been investigated in flow visualization experiments conducted in a water tunnel. The recessed angled spanwise blowing technique was utilized for vortex manipulation.

The flow was injected primarily in the spanwise direction but was also composed of a component normal to the wing surface. The location of vortex burst was measured as a function of blowing intensity and pulsing frequency under static conditions, and the optimum <b>blowing</b> <b>case</b> was applied at three different wing pitching rates. Experimental results have shown that, when the burst location is upstream of the blowing port, pulsed blowing delays vortex breakdown in static and dynamic cases.

The application of blowing, at the optimum pulsing frequency, made the vortex breakdown location comparable in static and ramp pitch-up conditions...|$|R

40|$|Turbine-blade cooling is an {{important}} issue for high-efficiency turbine engines, and discrete-hole injection is widely used as a cooling method. In the present study, detailed measurements were made of the heat transfer and hydrodynamics of a film-cooled flow on a convex wall, both for full and partial coverage. Two important parameters were altered: the blowing ratio, m, and the number of rows of injection holes. Three values of m were tested: m = 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6. In the blown region, m = 0. 4 results in the lowest Stanton numbers of the three blowing ratios tested. This indicates that the value of m = 0. 4 is near optimum on the convex wall {{from the point of view}} of cooling effect by injection. In the recovery region, Stanton numbers gradually approach the no injection values. Although the heat-transfer behavior during recovery from injection looks relatively complicated, the behavior of Stanton number can be explained in terms of two mechanisms: recovery from the thermal effect of injection and recovery from the turbulence augmentation. This interpretation of the data is supported by the hydrodynamic and temperture-profile measurements. For partial <b>blowing</b> <b>cases,</b> the data follow the full-coverage values inside the blown region. In the unblown region, both in the curved and in the flat plate, the effect of the number of blown rows is clearly seen.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work is to {{increase}} the knowledge of phenomena taking place during the initial stage in a top blown converter. The work has been done in a few steps resulting in four different supplements. Water model experiments have been carried out using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology. The system investigated was a fundamental top blown converter where an air jet was set to impinge on a water surface. The flow field of the combined <b>blown</b> <b>case,</b> where an air jet was introduced through a bottom nozzle, was also captured by the PIV. The work clearly showed that the flow field caused by an impinging top blown jet alone could not match that of the bottom <b>blown</b> <b>case.</b> The main re-circulation loop (or vortex) was investigated with respect to position and it was found that an increased flow rate pushes the center of the re-circulation loop downwards into the bath. However, for the top-blown case there is a point when the flow rate is too large to cause a distinguishable re-circulation loop since the jet becomes more plunging (i. e. penetrates deep into the bath) than impinging, with large surface agitation and splashing as a result. A numerical model with the same dimensions as the experimental system was then created. Three different turbulence models from the same family were tested: standard-, realizable- and a modified-(slight modification of one of the coefficients in order to produce less spreading of the air jet) k-ε turbulence model. It could be shown that for the family of k-ε turbulence models the difference in penetration depth was small and that the values corresponded well to literature data. However, {{when it comes to the}} position of the re-circulation loop it was shown that the realizable k-ε model produced better results when comparing the results to the experimental data produced from the PIV measurements, mentioned earlier. It was then shown how the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model could be coupled to thermodynamics databases in order to solve for both reactions and transport in the system. Instead of an air-water system, a gas-steel-slag system was created using the knowledge obtained in the previous simulation step described above. Reactions between gas-steel, gas-slag, steel-slag and gas-steel-slag were considered. Extrapolation of data from a few seconds of simulation was used for comparison to experimental data from the literature and showed reasonable agreement. The overall conclusion was that it is possible to make a coupling of the Thermo-Calc databases and a CFD software to make dynamic simulations of metallurgical processes such as a top-blown converter. A parametric study was then undertaken where two different steel grades were tested; one with high initial carbon content (3. 85 mass-%) and one with lower carbon content (0. 5 mass-%). The initial silicon content was held constant at 0. 84 mass-%. Different initial temperatures were tested and also some variation in initial dissolved oxygen content was tried. It was found that the rate of decarburization/desiliconization was influenced by the temperature and carbon concentration in the melt, where a high temperature as well as a high carbon concentration favors decarburization over desiliconization. It was also seen that the region affected by a lower concentration of alloys (or impurities) was quite small close to the axis where the impinging jet hits the bath. Add the oscillating nature of the cavity and it was realized that sampling from this region during an experiment might be quite difficult. QC 2010072...|$|R
