5|$|On September 1, 1827, McKenney and Whistler's force {{arrived at}} the Portage. On September 3, two Ho-Chunk leaders, Waukon Decorah and Carymaunee, {{surrendered}} Red <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> Wekau to the Americans. Carymaunee asked the Americans not to put irons on Red <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> Wekau; this request was granted. He then offered to give the Americans twenty horses {{in exchange for the}} prisoners, but this was declined. The Ho-Chunks turned in four more men involved in the uprising in the following weeks.|$|E

5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats.

The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Canadian women's 34-point 4 × 100 m {{freestyle}} relay and 4 × 100 m medley relay teams, Mortimer did not medal. Although her freestyle-relay team clocked 4:38.23 (missing the 2000 Canadian record by 0.22 second), they placed seventh in the finals. With Katarina Roxon, Morgan <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> Brianna Nelson in the medley relay, Mortimer's team finished seventh and last. Her times of 32.35 for the 50-metre and 1:06.37 for the 100-metre were the fastest for her legs of the events. At the 2012 Olympics, Mortimer's four medals were the most for any Canadian athlete or para-athlete.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge on the {{relationship}} between <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> fish is important when assessing the impact of infrastructural development on <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> fish in the coastal zone. It can have a direct effect on <b>bird</b> migration routes <b>and</b> resting areas. It can also have an indirect effect by changing the fish community and hence food availability for the bird community. RIKZ assigned Bureau Waardenburg a continuation of the prematurely terminated Flyland project in which {{the relationship}} between fish <b>and</b> <b>birds</b> should have been studied. This renewed project aims at describing the ecological relationships between marine <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> their food sources, mainly pelagic fish. The present report describes the results of a study {{on the relationship}} between fish <b>and</b> <b>birds</b> in the Dutch coastal zone. With this knowledge, impact of future infrastructural development on <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> their food (fish) can be better assessed...|$|R

To create the food animation used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Bird also interned at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film.|$|E

40|$|General EcologyWe {{investigated}} {{the relationships between}} <b>bird</b> species diversity <b>and</b> vegetation abundance, size, and groundcover of a forest ecosystem. We measured three variables: tree species diversity, tree diameter at breast height (DBH), {{and the amount of}} understory vegetation. We collected data at the AmeriFlux 1 and FASET 2 tower plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station property, Pellston, Michigan. The number of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> number of <b>bird</b> species significantly increased with an increase in groundcover. The number of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>bird</b> species decreased with an increase in number of trees. Also, the number of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>bird</b> species decreased with an increase in basal area (tree size). These observations indicate the number of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>bird</b> species decreased with an increase in number of trees and tree basal area and increased with an increase in groundcover; all indicators of bird species diversity varying because of differences in vegetation abundance, structure, size, and amount of understory vegetation...|$|R

5|$|Fossil records {{indicate}} that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> it was widespread {{on all three}} main islands.

The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1989 and continues.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state <b>bird,</b> <b>and</b> wild turkeys.

5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
