5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas complement each other in their different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same <b>basic</b> <b>group</b> of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and passages from one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit connections are related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E
5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods {{address all}} of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and {{implement}} the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required {{to live in a}} camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn <b>basic</b> <b>group</b> membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E

2500|$|The Sicilian Mafia, {{also known}} as simply the Mafia, is a {{criminal}} syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. [...] The <b>basic</b> <b>group</b> {{is known as a}} [...] "family", [...] "clan", or [...] "cosca". Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (borgata) of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves [...] "men of honour", although the public often refers to them as [...] "mafiosi". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.|$|E

30|$|The {{proportions}} of <b>basic</b> and acidic <b>groups</b> on the adsorbent surface obtained by Boehm titration are also shown in Table  1. All adsorbent samples indicated {{the presence of}} <b>basic</b> functional <b>groups</b> and thus the potential to act as MB adsorbents. The largest number of <b>basic</b> <b>groups</b> was found in SKOH and this is in good agreement with the overall surface charge indicated by comparison of pH and pHPZC values. However, the number of <b>basic</b> <b>groups</b> is lower for SHP than SW despite pH and pHPZC values indicating that SHP {{is more likely to}} have an overall positive charge than SW. The specific surface area was increased from 246.4 to 549.4  m 2 /g for SW and SKOH and a significant decrease to 75.6  m 2 /g for SHP is in agreement with the number of negatively charged functional groups available for adsorbing MB molecules.|$|R

The first attempt oftenends in vain with only a jumbled mess of colored cubies (as I will call onesmall cube in the bigger Rubik’s cube) in no coherent order.

Using <b>basic</b> <b>group</b> theory, the reason these solutions are notincredibly difficult to find will become clear.|$|E
50|$|Crystallins are {{separated}} into two classes: taxon-specific, or enzyme, and ubiquitous. The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and refractive {{index of the}} lens. Since lens central fiber cells lose their nuclei during development, these crystallins are made and then retained throughout life, making them extremely stable proteins. Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily. Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups. Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs, a connecting peptide, and N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. Beta-crystallins, the most heterogeneous, differ {{by the presence of}} the C-terminal extension (present in the <b>basic</b> <b>group,</b> none in the acidic group). Beta-crystallins form aggregates of different sizes and are able to self-associate to form dimers or to form heterodimers with other beta-crystallins. This gene, a beta <b>basic</b> <b>group</b> member, is part of a gene cluster with beta-A4, beta-B1, and beta-B3. A chain-terminating mutation was found to cause type 2 cerulean cataracts.|$|E
50|$|NOBIN is {{prepared}} by oxidative cross coupling of 2-naphthol and 2-naphthylamine. The oxidative source is metal ions in solution such as Fe2+ or a Cu2+ amine complex. Once racemic NOBIN is produced, {{it needs to}} be resolved. One method for this is the use of camphorsulfonic acid, in which the <b>basic</b> <b>group</b> of NOBIN is used to form a diastereomeric salt of one enantiomer. The other enantiomer however will stay in solution.|$|E

50|$|Pseudogeckoolithus is an oogenus of dinosaur egg. It {{is known}} from several {{fragments}} of eggshells. The outer surface {{of these are}} covered with little knobs and nodes.
