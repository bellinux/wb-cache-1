Darrell Hammond was the longest-serving cast member until 2017, {{having been a}} part of the cast for fourteen years between 1995 and 2009, and returned in 2014 as the show's announcer following the death of Don Pardo. In 2017 Kenan Thompson surpassed Hammond as the longest-serving cast member. Thompson first joined the series in 2003. Those selected to join the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Ferrell, Hartman, Lovitz, Wiig) and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey, Tim Meadows), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, Norm Macdonald), who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL.|$|E

One approach for obtaining solutions with improved accuracy is represented by the idea of refinement by differences of higher order, which was offered by Fox [1]: the right-hand side of the difference scheme is corrected by the solution obtained on the first stage and the scheme is repeatedly solved on the same grid. This empirical idea is simple, although its theoretical foundation encounters essential difficulties.
