25|$|In {{part due}} to the global supply {{shortage}} of sassafras oil, substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, mephedrone, or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as <b>bath</b> <b>salts.</b> Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and binding agents. Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country. The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of pea and fababean spun proteins {{has been}} studied by SEM and TEM {{as a function of}} dope pH and washing <b>bath</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations. The textural properties {mechanical resistance, moisture content) and diameter of the fibres have been determined. Spinning was only possible when dope pH was higher than 11. An increase in dope pH from 11. 5 to 13 induced a shear strength increase whereas the moisture content and the diameter of the fibres decreased. The structure of the fibres became more compact and changed from an aggregate of spherical particles to a tridimensional network. When dope pH was equal to 12. 6, the increase in washing <b>bath</b> <b>salt</b> content from 2 to 10 % NaCl produced more compact fibres. At high dope pH, the protein aggregates were dissociated and the polypeptide chains were unfolded, which favoured the lining up of the macromolecules during the spinning process and increased the protein -protein interactions in the fibres. High salt concentration in the washing <b>baths</b> produced a <b>salting</b> out effect which probably also enhanced the chain-chain interactions. Contrary to previous studies, protein strand orientation along the fibre axis and a double cortex-core structure have been demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The QPQ complex <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> {{treatment}} {{is a type}} of surface strengthening technology which contains mainly <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> nitriding and <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> post-oxidizing processes. The effect of nitriding temperature and duration on the corrosion resistance of QPQ treated specimens is explored by immersion tests and salt spray tests in this paper. The material used in this study was 1020 annealed steel. In the immersion tests, the specimens were immersed in 3 ‰H 2 O 2 and 10 % NaCl water solution. In the salt spray tests, specimens were salt spray tested using a 5 % NaCl neutral solution. The data indicate that, when the nitriding duration is less than 2 hours at temperature below 590 (phase change will exist when the nitriding temperature is above 590 according to Fe-N phase diagram), the higher temperature of the <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> nitriding, the specimens will have the higher corrosion resistance. In addition we have found that nitriding for too short a time generates a thin compound layer, and nitriding for too long generates too much porosity. Both will deteriorate the corrosion resistance...|$|R
