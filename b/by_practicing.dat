5|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{not only}} endorses republicanism, {{but also a}} social {{contract}} based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green {{just a few years}} earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> universal benevolence.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement <b>by</b> <b>practicing,</b> or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of the arrest of former governor Charles S. Morehead by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of Warner Underwood {{he was able to}} return home on the condition that he swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.|$|E

5|$|Akins {{began playing}} high school {{football}} at Starkville High School as a freshman. Due to his small size, Akins rarely played. As a senior, he was ruled ineligible for academic reasons but continued practicing with the football team throughout the season. Akins was also able to participate on the track and field team, running sprints. After Akins impressed his {{high school football}} coach <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> despite his ineligibility, the coach invited East Mississippi Community College to look at Akins. A representative of East Mississippi attended a track and field meet where Akins won the 100 metres and offered him a scholarship to play college football shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court {{and replace it with}} a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. <b>By</b> <b>practicing</b> as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised by law {{enforcement}} and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings. They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> at height, with police forces calling for practitioners {{to stay off the}} rooftops. Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.|$|E
25|$|In Theravada the {{ultimate}} goal is the cessation of the kleshas and the attainment of the sublime state of Nirvana, achieved <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> the Noble Eightfold Path (also known as the Middle Way), thus escaping what is seen as a cycle of suffering and rebirth. Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|According to Bronkhorst, this {{indicates}} that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> the four dhyanas, which originally {{was thought to be}} sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.|$|E
25|$|<b>By</b> <b>practicing</b> prāyaṣcitta (repentance), a soul {{gets rid of}} sins, and commits no transgressions; he who {{correctly}} practises prāyaṣcitta gains {{the road}} and the reward of the road, he wins the reward of good conduct. By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear.|$|E
25|$|Although DeBakey {{does not}} have its own sports teams, the school has some {{athletic}} clubs such as Basketball Club or Volleyball Club, which compete with other local high schools. For example, the basketball club at DeBakey High School often competes against HAIS. Despite the lack of sports, many students thrive <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> outside of school. Lynnsey Nguyen, a student who graduated from DeBakey in 2015, was recruited for the University of St. Thomas volleyball team.|$|E

25|$|Sōtō is the Japanese {{line of the}} Chinese Caodong school, {{which was}} founded during the Tang Dynasty by Dongshan Liangjie. The Sōtō-school has de-{{emphasized}} kōans since Gentō Sokuchū (circa 1800), and instead emphasized shikantaza. Dogen, the founder of Soto in Japan, emphasised that practice and awakening cannot be separated. <b>By</b> <b>practicing</b> shikantaza, attainment and Buddhahood are already being expressed. For Dogen, zazen, or shikantaza, {{is the essence of}} Buddhist practice. Gradual cultivation was also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Wright brothers' design of a controllable airplane that could fly against a strong wind and land on solid ground, Langley sought safety <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> in calm air over the Potomac River. This required a catapult for launching. The craft had no landing gear, the plan being to descend into the water after demonstrating flight which if successful would entail a partial, if not total, rebuilding of the machine. Langley gave up the project after two crashes on take-off on October 7 and December 8, 1903.|$|E
25|$|Moscow was {{stable and}} prosperous {{for many years}} and {{attracted}} a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.|$|E

25|$|An {{increasing}} number of economists and international commerce theorists have suggested that economic discrimination goes far {{beyond the bounds of}} individuals or businesses. The largest scale forms of economic discrimination, and the widest ranging, affect entire nations or global regions. Many consider that an open world economic system (globalization), which includes world bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), places countries at risk <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> explicitly discriminatory techniques such as bilateral and regional bargaining, as well as asymmetrical trade balances and the maintaining of cheap force labor. Trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are often regarded as financial measures serving to economically oppress third world nations.|$|E
25|$|Causes {{parallel}} the evolutionary changes {{occurring in the}} US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; aging of the population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, {{most of which are}} handled in primary care settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all. In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening. Discontent <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a general internal medicine career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision. Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks.|$|E
25|$|In 199 BC Cato {{was chosen}} aedile, {{and with his}} {{colleague}} Helvius, restored the Plebeian Games, and gave upon that occasion a banquet in honor of Jupiter. In 198 BC he was made praetor, and obtained Sardinia as his province, with the command of 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Here he took the earliest opportunity to demonstrate his main beliefs <b>by</b> <b>practicing</b> his strict public morality. He reduced official operating costs, walked his trips with a single assistant, and, by the studied lack of ceremony, placed his own frugality in striking contrast with the oppressive opulence of provincial magistrates. The rites of religion were celebrated with reasonable thrift, justice was administered with strict impartiality; usury was controlled with deep severity, and the usurers were banished. Sardinia had been for some time completely calmed, but according to Aurelius Victor, a revolt in the island was subdued by Cato during his Praetorship.|$|E
