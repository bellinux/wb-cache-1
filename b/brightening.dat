5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or <b>brightening)</b> occurred over the ocean has {{been a bit of}} an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar <b>brightening</b> beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The <b>brightening</b> seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The <b>brightening</b> tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the <b>brightening</b> beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions are found in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of <b>brightening</b> slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|The Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) {{has been}} {{collecting}} surface measurements. BSRN {{was started in}} the early 1990s and updated the archives in this time. Analysis of recent data reveals that {{the surface of the}} planet has brightened by about 4% in the past decade. The <b>brightening</b> trend is corroborated by other data, including satellite analyses.|$|E
50|$|The Sarasota Woman’s Club functioned under several {{codes of}} conduct. They {{published}} their constitution and by-laws in The Sarasota Times just after their founding in 1913. In {{addition to these}} rules, the club espoused a mantra called the “Brighten Up Rules”:That the Woman’s Club believes in.To <b>Brighten</b> Up myself—to be optimistic, cheerful and good…To <b>Brighten</b> Up my home and spread the <b>Brighten</b> Up spirit among my neighbors.To <b>Brighten</b> Up my business and take pleasure as well as profit from it.To <b>Brighten</b> Up my town and promote its social, Industrial and commercial progress.To promote the love of Nature sunshine and fresh air.To adopt <b>Brighten</b> Up as my slogan.|$|R

30|$|By 2011 January 15 most of {{the altered}} areas had <b>brightened,</b> but with one moderate-sized darkened area still {{southeast}} of Notus Undae. That darkened area is flanked to both the ENE and WSW by similarly sized <b>brightened</b> areas. The previously darkened zones in south Adiri adjacent to Belet became <b>brightened</b> areas. The previously darkened region between Dolmed Montes and Notus Undae had by then also become <b>brightened</b> relative to its original, pre-cloudburst state. A larger <b>brightened</b> area west of Dolmed Montes extends for 250 km {{to the south of}} the Angmar Montes range and parallel to it. Along the eastern part of this study area there is a large <b>brightened</b> region located between Echoriath Montes and Gram Montes, east of the eastern lobe of Notus Undae. And some smaller <b>brightened</b> surfaces exist either in or adjacent to the eastern end of Merlock Montes.|$|R
5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks {{to make it easier}} for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and <b>brightening</b> the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening. This {{has been estimated}} at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual <b>brightening</b> {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|Several unusual supernovae and impostors {{have been}} {{compared}} to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 {{which is likely to}} have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor <b>brightening</b> in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. Eta Carinae has also {{been compared to}} other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.|$|E
30|$|By 2011 April 25, the large, {{moderately}} darkened {{area has}} disappeared. Instead, {{much of that}} area is now <b>brightened</b> instead, beyond its original albedo.

5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and <b>brightening</b> of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E
5|$|The first {{infrared}} {{observations were}} published in 1998, in which both near and far infrared spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep <b>brightening</b> in 1996, followed by {{a sharp decline in}} 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity <b>brightening</b> towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E

5|$|The constellation's two {{brightest}} stars—Alpha and Epsilon Antliae—shine with {{a reddish}} tinge. Alpha is an orange giant of spectral type K4III {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. It is located 370 ± 20 light-years away from Earth. Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the luminosity of the Sun, it is most likely an ageing star that is <b>brightening</b> and {{on its way to}} becoming a Mira variable star, having converted all its core fuel into carbon. Located 710 ± 40 light-years from Earth, Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa, that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 times that of the Sun, and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns. It is slightly variable. At the other end of Antlia, Iota Antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type K1 III.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It spent much of its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and <b>brightening</b> as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 light years away, with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with a magnitude of 3.87. It is approximately 63 times as luminous the Sun, with a surface temperature of 5279 K. Delta Apodis is a double star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta1 is a red giant star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 light years away. It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days. Delta2 is an orange giant star of spectral type K3III, located 610 ± 30 light years away, with a magnitude of 5.3. The separate components can be resolved with the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|Observations in 2004 by the Very Long Baseline Array for 42 {{consecutive}} days gave new data {{and understanding of}} the action of the jets. It appears that the jets are sometimes impacting material shortly after being created and thus <b>brightening.</b> The material the jets are impacting appears to be replaced some of the time, but not always, leading to variations in the <b>brightening</b> of the jets.|$|E

40|$|Soft {{proofing}} is {{a solution}} for print buyers and printers who want to decrease production cost and cycle time. When print buyers are increasingly specifying <b>brightened</b> papers, {{the use of the}} standard printer ICC profile, e. g., SWOP 3 and GRACoL 2006, as the source color space in the ICC-based color proofing workflow, no longer suffice. This is because the proof looks yellowish in comparison to the <b>brightened</b> print with a bluish white point that print buyers desire. To overcome the mismatch between the soft proof and the <b>brightened</b> print, this research builds a number of source ICC profiles, including profiles built using the substrate-corrected colorimetric aims (SCCA), and profiles built using full dataset. By conducting psychometric tests in a soft proofing environment, the results indicate that (1) the soft proof to <b>brightened</b> print match depends on the source ICC profile; (2) source ICC profiles, built from a fully characterized dataset or the substrate-corrected dataset, improve color match between the soft proof and the <b>brightened</b> print; and (3) the degree of color match between the soft proof and the print is image-dependent...|$|R
