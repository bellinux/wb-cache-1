5|$|Echols {{recalled}} {{that the first}} scenes shot were those of Madonna walking down Lenox Avenue.

After the misunderstandings regarding looks and the plot direction were cleared, the filming resumed and was finished within three days. The final scenes were with model Jason Olive in a Marlem house, with Madonna climbing steps and reaching him and their supposed child.|$|E

5|$|Up! Close and Personal is {{the fourth}} live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was {{directed}} by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and produced by team composed of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee, with an audience of 300 people. When conceptualizing the show, Twain desired to make the setting intimate and perform the songs acoustically, so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert. It was also modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by <b>black,</b> <b>leather</b> jumpsuit. Up! Close and Personal premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on November 25, 2003, and was high in ratings, being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E

During his rap, there are scenes where Alexandra backflips off a bar table, and pushes two men powerfully over a bar and through a door.
