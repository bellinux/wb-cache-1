5|$|The Yugoslav {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} Croatian nationalists were {{to blame for}} <b>bringing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. Later that day, a bomb exploded aboard a train travelling from Vienna to Zagreb, injuring six.

No arrests were ever made. The Czechoslovak Civil Aviation Authority later attributed the explosion to a briefcase bomb.|$|E
5|$|The Roman heavy cavalry now {{charged the}} German horsemen. In the ensuing mêlée, Chnodomar's stratagem paid dividends. The {{interspersed}} foot warriors wreaked havoc, <b>bringing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> horses of the cataphracts and then killing their riders on the ground. Unnerved by these tactics, {{and by the}} injury {{of one of their}} tribuni, the cataphracts panicked and fled the field. In their headlong flight, they crashed into the Roman infantry on the right, which, however, was able to maintain formation because of the skill of the crack auxilia palatina regiments Cornuti and Brachiati posted there. The cataphracts took refuge behind the infantry lines, where it took the personal intervention of Julian himself to rally them. Zosimus claims that one regiment of cataphracts refused to return to the fight and that after the battle, they were obliged by Julian to wear female clothes as punishment. The performance {{of the rest of the}} cavalry is not described by Ammianus, but they would have been obliged to retreat with the cataphracts, though it is unclear whether they followed them to behind the infantry lines, or, more likely, halted to cover the Roman right wing. It is clear, however, that the German cavalry was unable to capitalise on their success to outflank the Roman right. Nevertheless, Chnodomar had trumped Julian's best card.|$|E

5|$|The continual warring {{with the}} Cholas {{exhausted}} both empires, giving their subordinates {{the opportunity to}} rebel. In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of Jagadhekamalla II, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, Tailapa III, was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. Tailapa III was taken captive and later released <b>bringing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> prestige of the Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and Seunas also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala Narasimha I defeated and killed Tailapa III {{but was unable to}} overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the Kalachuris of Kalyanis under Bijjala II captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri in the present day Dharwad district.|$|E
5|$|To {{ameliorate}} {{the situation}} the old Republic maintained {{a policy of}} severe austerity during the century, especially economizing on its defense outlays (which in large part explains why its military and political role declined so much). Up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War this policy succeeded in <b>bringing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> level of debt, but this war brought a large uptick in the public debt: between 1780 and 1794 the province of Holland alone issued 120 million guilders of new bonds. In 1795, its total debt stood at 455 million guilders. To this should be added the debts of the United East India Company and its sister, the WIC, and the five Dutch Admiralties {{for a total of}} about 150 million guilders. The other provinces owed 155 million guilders. The grand total in 1795, {{at the beginning of the}} Batavian Republic, came to 760 million guilders; this imposed a debt service of 25 million guilders annually. The indemnity of the Treaty of The Hague immediately added 100 million guilders to this total, and the maintenance of the French army of occupation added about 12 million annually (while the other funding requirements of the republic added another 20 million annually). In 1814 the public debt stood at 1.7 billion guilders.|$|E
