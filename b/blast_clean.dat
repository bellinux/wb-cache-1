40|$|Sri Lanka {{has made}} a {{significant}} development {{in the design and}} construction sector during the last 10 years. The use of steel is one of the governing construction materials in the industries. One of the major concerns of existing steel structures is the durability. Corrosion and deterioration have become major challenges in the lifetime of the structure, as {{it is one of the}} major public focuses on the structures. Standards are intended to assist engineers and corrosion experts in adopting best practice in corrosion protection of structural steel at new constructions with proper identification of an actual exposure. There are six environmental corrosivity categories according to BS ISO 12944 as C 1, C 2 C 3, C 4, C 5 and C 5 –M. Those are according to BS standard and they should be adapted for Sri Lanka. In this research environmental corrosivity category of SC 1, SC 2, SC 3 and SC 4 are classified for Sri Lanka considering corrosion affecting factors temperature, rainfall, coastal region and industrial zones. A field survey was carried out in different locations of the structure in the country to identify the pattern of corrosion according to variation of corrosion affecting factors. Among the methods used to clean the surface of the steel before applying corrosion protection, sand <b>blasting</b> <b>cleans</b> best. However, it cannot be carried out in every location due to environmental issues and equipment required. Steel surface is difficult to clean using light tools because temporary stabilized corroded layer on the steel surface. If we change this surface (Convert surface grade A to Surface grade B), the light tools can be used for the surface preparation. Therefore a new method is proposed to change this surface grade. Firstly, sea water is sprayed on to the surface to increase the rate of corrosion and left for a day for rust to appear. Then it is cleaned by fresh water and surface salinity level should be checked using salinity meter. Then the surface can be prepared using “Cup-Brush application” method without using sand blasting. By this method well cleaned surface can be obtained and then the surface protection primer is applied on it immediately. This surface protection primer type and primer and paint thickness should be defined according to environmental corrosivity category...|$|R
50|$|When the {{restoration}} began in 2003, {{the building itself}} was deemed in good condition. It was, however, very dirty. One of the most noteworthy elements of {{the restoration}} focused on cleaning the exterior. The facade is predominantly porous sandstone, which had over the years had accumulated a thick crust of grime and pollutants. The formerly light gray stone had become a deep, dark black. Traditional methods to <b>blast</b> away or <b>clean</b> the pollutants with chemicals were deemed unsuitable, and the exterior was cleaned by lasers.

40|$|In recent years, carbon-fibre-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) {{laminates}} {{have been}} used in the repair and/or strengthening of existing steel structures. One advantage of using CFRP is its high tensile strength and stiffness compared with its low self-weight. This paper describes the research of strengthening steel structures with CFRP laminates under static conditions and comprises both laboratory tests and simplified analytical methods for predicting the capacity of steel girders strengthened with bonded CFRP laminates. The analytical solutions consist of calculation of bending capacity, normal stress distribution over the cross-section and interfacial shear stresses. By bonding CFRP laminates to the tensioned flange of a steel girder, it is possible to increase the moment capacity. The forces which are acting over the strengthened section, will cause interfacial stresses in the bond line. These interfacial stresses may cause debonding between the steel substrate and the laminate why these stresses must be considered in the design process. Simplified analyses were performed using Matlab to calculate the difference in stiffness and moment capacity depending on quantity and stiffness of the applied laminates. These solutions are based upon equilibrium statements over the section. The simplified analyses show {{that it is possible to}} increase the moment capacity by using bonded CFRP laminates to steel girders to a level of 20 %, see Figure 1. By using developed simplified solution described above, it is also possible to calculate to which extend the steel section has reached yielding. The solution shows for studied cross-section that a maximum increase in terms of the moment capacity is about 20 %, and, as a result, nearly the whole cross-section will be in compression. Tension will almost only be transmit by the CFRP laminate. To increase the moment capacity further, strengthening has to be made on the compressed area. Also, interfacial shear stresses in the bond line for the studied beams were calculated using an existing solution for calculation of interfacial stresses for arbitrary substrates. (Graph Presented) With results from the analytical solutions laboratory tests were conducted. The test specimens consist of CFRP laminates and epoxies of different material properties, which were attached to the tensioned flange of undistorted steel beams wifh H-shaped cross-sections. All beams were sand <b>blasted</b> <b>cleaned</b> and coated with a primer directly afterward. When the primer had cured, the epoxy was applied to the CFRP laminate and then bonded to the steel substrate by a hard roller. At the ends, the redundant epoxy was tapered shaped to reduce the stresses. The strengthened beams were tested in static four points bending where load-deformation of the beam and strain both in the steel section and the laminate was recorded. [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{performance of}} the bristle blasting process {{is a consequence of}} synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The tool head with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and roughness (anchor profile) mimics those obtained by grit <b>blasting</b> processes. The <b>cleaned</b> and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for the subsequent application and adhesion of protective films and industrial coatings.|$|R
40|$|The LTC 1073 Vacuum Blasting Machine uses a high capacity, direct {{pressure}} {{blasting system}} incorporating a continuous feed for the blast media. The <b>blast</b> media <b>cleans</b> the surface within the contained brush {{area of the}} blast head. A vacuum system removes dust and debris from the surfaces as it is blasted. After cleaning the surface, the abrasive, together with the rust or coating that {{was removed from the}} surface, is vacuumed into the machine through the suction hose. The dust separator contains angled steel collision pads, working with the force of gravity, to allow any reusable abrasive to fall back into the pressure vessel. The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back flushing, dust is dumped from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the bellows valve. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other safety and health issues found were ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, lockout/tagout, and arm-hand vibration...|$|R

50|$|Process speeds are {{generally}} not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media. However the presence of water between {{the media and the}} substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the media and the surface from excess damage. This has the dual advantage of lowering media breakdown rates and preventing impregnation of foreign materials into the surface. Hence surfaces after wet <b>blasting</b> are extremely <b>clean,</b> there is no embedded secondary contamination from the media or from previous blasting processes, and there is no static cling of dust to the blasted surface. Subsequent coating or bonding operations are not effected by the use of wet blasting or dry blasting because of the cleanliness levels achieved are identical. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g., stainless steel and carbon (mild) steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.|$|R
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was <b>cleaned,</b> <b>blasted,</b> and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|R
40|$|NUKEM Technologies was {{contracted}} to supply a dry, automated drum belt (tumbling) Abrasive Blasting Unit (ABU) to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Ispra, Italy. The ABU {{was installed in}} the centralised radioactive waste management area of the JRC-Ispra site in Italy. The unit is to be employed for the decontamination to clearance levels of slightly contaminated metal components and, where practical, concrete or heavy concrete (density ~ 3200 kg/m³) blocks arising from the dismantling of nuclear facilities. The presentation {{is based on the}} successful construction and installation of the ABU at the JRC Ispra site. Among the several possibilities of adapting conventional abrasive units to nuclear applications, an automatic tumbling machine was preferred, due to the larger output and (mainly) for the ease of operation, with minimum direct handling of contaminated material by operators, thus satisfying the ALARA principle. Consideration was also given to Belgoprocess' successful experience with a predecessor, similar unit. After adequate size reduction batches of up to about 800 kg of material to be decontaminated are automatically introduced into the blasting chamber. Pieces between 100 mm and 800 mm long, between 100 mm and 500 mm wide and between 5 mm and 300 mm high can be effectively treated in the unit, the maximum weight of a single piece being limited to 100 kg. Pipes less than 300 mm long and with an internal diameter larger than 40 mm and other components with hard-to-reach surfaces may be included. The content of the chamber is tumbled by two bladed drums, while sharp steel grit is sprayed onto the contaminated components, thus removing the surface layer including any contamination. From experience, 30 minutes of treatment is sufficient to remove contamination to levels below expected clearance levels for most materials. The decontaminated components are removed from the blasting chamber automatically and collected in skips. Dust and grit are led to a series of separators; the grit gets recycled to the <b>blasting</b> chamber, <b>cleaned</b> off contaminants such as paint are fed to collection bins, and the dust is bagged into waste drums. Airflow through the whole system cleans the decontaminated components, transports the dust to the collecting area, and acts as a dynamic barrier to limit risks of contamination of the surrounding areas. Prior to release back into the room, the air is filtered in a series of automatically cleaned filters, followed by HEPA filters. The whole facility is operated in an automatic mode: the operators are only required to place drums or pallets of contaminated material onto the feeder, and remove skips of decontaminated material and drums of secondary waste such as dust. The presentation will describe the system and potential applications in the nuclear industry in detail. JRC. C. 1 -Nuclear Decommissionin...|$|R
