After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him. He finishes dressing for the fight and, as {{he walks to the}} ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the camera pulls <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
25|$|Fashion in {{the period}} 1500–1550 in Western Europe is marked by voluminous {{clothing}} worn in an abundance of layers (one reaction to the cooling temperatures of the Little Ice Age, especially in Northern Europe and the British Isles). Contrasting fabrics, slashes, embroidery, applied trims, {{and other forms of}} surface ornamentation became prominent. The tall, narrow lines of the late Medieval period were replaced with a wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders. Sleeves were a center of attention, and were puffed, slashed, cuffed, and turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> contrasting linings.|$|E

25|$|The king in his regal vestments, {{wearing the}} Great Crown of Victory, {{makes his way}} from the {{residence}} behind {{and sits on the}} Phuttan Kanchanasinghat throne (พระที่นั่งพุดตานกาญจนสิงหาสน์). This highly ornamental throne is shaped like a step pyramid; the different tiers are decorated with the figures of Devatas and Garudas. Above the throne is the nine-tiered royal umbrella. The throne is situated near to {{the south side of the}} hall. At this point a heavy gold curtain separates and obscures the enthroned king from his audience on the northern side of the hall. When the king is ready a fanfare will begin, a salute is rendered and with three taps of two ivory blocks (as a signal), the curtain is suddenly drawn <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> to the waiting audience the king in state.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} {{episode of the}} series, Cavallari decides to move to Europe. In the final scene, Jenner is shown to be {{watching}} the limousine bringing Cavallari to the airport travel down her street. With the camera on Jenner, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Cavallari {{stepped out of the}} vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E

50|$|Transmission {{from the}} same herd of pigs <b>back</b> <b>to</b> humans was <b>revealed</b> on 20 July, though it {{occurred}} on 7 May when the humans, animal health inspectors, were taking samples from the infected herd with improper self-protective measures.|$|R
500|$|The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One {{camera shot}} begins inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and pulls <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot {{continues}} {{to pull back}} and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene {{was inspired by a}} New York City production of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens {{to make it easier for}} the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000footcandles so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The [...] dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish. The entire set for the scene was [...] wide and [...] high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget.|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim, who also directed the video for the group's subsequent single [...] "Do or Die", and shows the Super Furry Animals waiting to leave Mars having played a concert on the planet. The video begins with Gruff Rhys standing alone on the Martian soil, singing along to the song. A silver, computer generated, spaceship is seen landing behind Rhys. Around one minute into the track the camera pans <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals sitting down to the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is sat on the floor playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his left hand on Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large round face and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around and looks up to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before the camera moves behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes. The aliens were designed by regular Super Furry Animals collaborator Pete Fowler, who acted as [...] "creative advisor" [...] for the video. According to Rhys the aliens were animated by the same special effects team that worked on [...] Rhys has stated that he considers his performance in the video to be [...] "wooden" [...] as he was forced to take painkillers during the shoot due to a [...] "stiff neck".|$|E
500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Pedro Romhanyi, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} band in an all white room playing along to the track. A station identification logo for [...] "SFA television" [...] is seen in the top left and a green graphic appears, showing the volume level being turned up. The camera pans <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a TV which switches channel from [...] "SFA" [...] to a station showing golf. The rest of the video continues this pattern, continually flicking between the band {{and a variety of other}} stations, which generally feature similar logos to real life channels but with slightly different names e.g. [...] "Cartoon Animals" [...] (Cartoon Network), [...] "CVQ" [...] (QVC), [...] "Animal Channel" [...] (Discovery Channel) Actors, news presenters, puppets, a golfer, an astronaut and weatherman sing along with the track as the television stops on the channel each appears on. At one point, the band are shown in silhouette in homage to the cover of Hot Rocks 1964-1971 by The Rolling Stones. As the video ends, the camera pans back to show a television in a room with a man having a telephone conversation. The camera continues to pan back showing this image on a television on a shelf in a small room. The camera pans back through three more televisions, each showing an image of the last shot, ending with a TV in a wallpapered room next to an electric fire. A few seconds before the video ends the screen turns to static. The Pedro Romhanyi video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] single.|$|E

She has a fur muff on her right wrist, trimmed with a ribbon bow, and carries a fan. She wears the short string of pearls that {{remained}} fashionable throughout this period.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regeneration}} [...] "effect" [...] {{was accomplished}} during the series' original run from 1963–1989 primarily {{through the use}} of video mixing. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of The Tenth Planet with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Troughton in the next serial. However, vision mixer Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{video for}} the song was filmed near Slough, Berkshire, during November 1981 and has {{the theme of the}} filming and editing of a murder-mystery film, {{featuring}} the band members as characters and production staff. [...] Due to it being a [...] "making of" [...] video, both crew and camera apparatus appear throughout. It was conceived and directed by filmmaker Steve Barron, and has at its core the interaction between a successful actress (also a 2nd negative cutter) played by Susan Ann Sulley walking out on [...] "film director" [...] Philip Oakey on a film set. [...] It is loosely based on the film A Star Is Born. Near the end of the video, Wright, who also plays a film editor, has an expression on his face, while the camera pulls <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that the negative room where Oakey, Wright, and Sulley were working in is yet another set (the camera {{can be seen in the}} mirror's reflection).|$|E

The insight contemplations open up inner self and metaphysical thinking of the artist for the viewer ("Shell" [...] 1975, [...] "Amulet", 1977, [...] "Indian jug" [...] 1975).|$|R
5000|$|The {{back of the}} box {{featured}} a pair of large Sunday comics-style comic strips and instructions on how <b>to</b> open the <b>back</b> flap <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> more comics. The entire back of the box opened <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> a [...] "fifth panel" [...] with six more color comics inside {{for a total of}} eight strips per box. This flap structure was described as [...] "an original packaging concept" [...] for breakfast cereal. [...] In 1988, Ralston won an award for [...] "innovative packaging" [...] for the Morning Funnies fifth panel design.|$|R
5|$|On 22 January 1976, {{a second}} UDR soldier, Sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell (aged 29, an optical worker, also from Lurgan) {{was arrested and}} charged with the Miami killings. He served in C Company, 11th Battalion UDR. The RUC were led to him through his glasses which had been found at the murder scene.

2500|$|In their differing ways, British singers Joss Stone (who, in 2011, named American singer Gwen Stefani as {{her style}} icon and was by then {{combining}} an independent professional {{career with the}} lifestyle of a [...] "Devon hippy") and (notwithstanding an early tendency {{to be associated with}} photographic spreads for [...] "lads' magazines") Rachel Stevens were both held up in the mid-noughties as exemplars of boho. So, a few years later, were Diana Vickers and another teenaged singer, Pixie Lott. Following an event in 2009, the Daily Mail commented about Vickers that looked like a cross between a stylish sixties icon and a rambler as she donned a stunning backless dress with a tramp's boots for an X Factor party last night. The 17-year-old, who spent much of her time on the ITV show running around barefoot, opted to cover up her feet with the charity shop footwear. The footwear drew attention away from the singer's stylish sixties style black and red dress which was split open at the <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> her bra." ...|$|E
2500|$|After d'Erlon's attack commenced, Joachim Jerome Quiot du Passage's 1st Division {{encountered}} the British 95th Rifles {{in the gravel}} pit and inclined to its right. This movement caused the 2nd Division to hesitate and Marcognet's division surged several hundred yards into the lead. The Netherlands 7th and 8th National Militia Battalions engaged in a fire fight with the French skirmishers, taking some loss. Suddenly, their opponents fell <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the front rank of Marcognet's column at close range. The French fired a tremendous volley from 400 muskets which inflicted heavy losses on the militiamen, who immediately retired on the second line. The men of Rogers' nearby battery abandoned their position and spiked {{one of their own}} guns. As Denis Pack ordered his British brigade forward from the second line, the battalion of the 45th Line in Marcognet's front rank found itself being attacked by the 92nd Foot, a Scottish Highland regiment. The Highlanders fired into the mass before them at a range of [...] but their volley was not fully effective because of their four-deep line formation. Overlapping the 92nd on both flanks, the 45th Line fired another crushing volley, throwing the Highlanders into confusion. At this moment, the British division commander Thomas Picton fell dead from a bullet in his forehead. The 3rd Division began to shout, [...] "Victory".|$|E
6000|$|Bert {{stood there}} in the middle of the bridge, in a place that most people who knew it remembered as a place populous with sightseers and excursionists, and he was the only human being in sight there. Above him, very high in the heavens, the contending air-fleets manoeuvred; below him the river seethed like a sluice towards the American Fall. He was curiously dressed. His cheap blue serge {{trousers}} were thrust into German airship rubber boots, and on his head he wore an aeronaut's white cap that was a trifle too large for him. He thrust that <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> his staring little Cockney face, still scarred upon the brow. [...] "Gaw!" [...] he whispered.|$|E

Chloe pursues a relationship with Lucas Horton, but it ends when she cheats on him with Daniel Jonas. Chloe eventually began a relationship with Daniel. Daniel and Chloe were engaged, but their relationship was complicated when Daniel's friend, Carly Manning, came to town, and they discovered that Daniel had fathered Carly's daughter, Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett).|$|R
500|$|Lucius {{emerges from}} this {{experience}} in the morning, [...] and the priests dress him in an elaborately embroidered cloak. He then stands on a dais carrying a torch and wearing a crown of palm leaves—"adorned like the sun and {{set up in the}} manner of a divine statue", as Apuleius describes it. The priests draw <b>back</b> curtains <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Lucius <b>to</b> a crowd of his fellow devotees. During the next three days, Lucius enjoys a series of banquets and sacred meals with his fellow worshippers, completing the initiation process.|$|R
