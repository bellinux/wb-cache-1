40|$|SummaryHow are {{skeletal}} tissues {{derived from}} skeletal stem cells? Here, we map <b>bone,</b> <b>cartilage,</b> and stromal development from {{a population of}} highly pure, postnatal skeletal stem cells (mouse skeletal stem cells, mSSCs) to their downstream progenitors of <b>bone,</b> <b>cartilage,</b> and stromal tissue. We then investigated the transcriptome of the stem/progenitor cells for unique gene-expression patterns that would indicate potential regulators of mSSC lineage commitment. We demonstrate that mSSC niche factors can be potent inducers of osteogenesis, and several specific combinations of recombinant mSSC niche factors can activate mSSC genetic programs in situ, even in nonskeletal tissues, resulting in de novo formation of <b>cartilage</b> or <b>bone</b> and bone marrow stroma. Inducing mSSC formation with soluble factors and subsequently regulating the mSSC niche to specify its differentiation toward <b>bone,</b> <b>cartilage,</b> or stromal cells could represent a paradigm shift in the therapeutic regeneration of skeletal tissues...|$|R

50|$|This technique/repair {{requires}} transplant {{sections of}} <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage.</b> First, the damaged section of <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> {{is removed from}} the joint. Then a new healthy dowel of <b>bone</b> with its <b>cartilage</b> covering is punched out of the same joint and replanted into the hole left from removing the old damaged <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage.</b> The healthy <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> are taken from areas of low stress in the joint so as to prevent weakening the joint. Depending on the severity and overall size of the damage multiple plugs or dowels may be required to adequately repair the joint, which becomes difficult for Osteochondral Autografts. The clinical results may deteriorate over time.|$|R

40|$|The treatment/regeneration of <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> {{diseases}} or defects, whether {{induced by}} rheumatism, joint dysplasia, trauma, or surgery presents great challenges {{that have not}} been fully solved by the current therapies. In the last few years, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have been proposing advanced tools and technologies for <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> tissue regeneration, and some of which have successfully reached the market. Beyond the source of cells, the creation of superior structures for replacing defective <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> requires strong research in biomechanical signaling and synthesis of advanced biomaterials to mimic human tissues at the most varied levels. Natural and synthetic polymers, bioresorbable inorganic materials, and composites have been investigated for its potential as scaffolding materials with enhanced mechanical and biological properties. Porous scaffolds, hydrogels, and fibers are the most commonly biomimetic structures used for <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> tissue engineering. Herein, the concepts and current treatment strategies for <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> repair, as well as biomimetic strategies for <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> tissue engineering are overviewed.

40|$|Structural {{changes of}} <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> are a {{hallmark}} of inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Despite certain similarities – in particular, inflammation as the driving force for structural changes – the three major inflammatory joint diseases show considerably different pathologies. Whereas RA primarily results in <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> resorption, PsA combines destructive elements with anabolic bone responses, and AS is the prototype of a hyper-responsive joint disease associated with substantial <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> apposition. In the present review we summarize the clinical picture and pathophysiologic processes of <b>bone</b> and <b>cartilage</b> damage in RA, PsA, and AS, we describe the key insights obtained from the introduction of TNF blockade, and we discuss the future challenges and frontiers of structural damage in arthritis...|$|R
