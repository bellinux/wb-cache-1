50|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>blackstart</b> was by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824 under the binomial name Saxicola melanura. The <b>blackstart</b> was included as the type species in the genus Cercomela introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2010 and 2012 found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the <b>blackstart,</b> phylogenetically nested within the genus Oenanthe. As part of a reorganization of the species to create monotypic genera, the <b>blackstart</b> {{was assigned to the}} genus Oenanthe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackstart</b> (Oenanthe melanura) is a chat {{found in}} desert regions in North Africa, the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. It is {{resident}} throughout its range.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a species}} of rocky deserts and {{mountain}} slopes which nests in a rock crevice where it lays its 3-4 eggs. It feeds on insects, taken mainly on the ground. The <b>blackstart</b> is a confident species, unafraid of man.|$|E
40|$|Although {{power system}} blackouts are rare events {{occurring}} in a well-organised power system, {{it is essential}} to have a restoration plan. The objective of such a plan is to bring the power system back into a normal operating condition as soon as possible to minimise the impact of a blackout on the society. This paper discusses the restoration procedures, which are based on <b>blackstarting</b> distributed energy resources (DR) in a MicroGrid (MG) at medium voltage (MV) networks. The developed restoration procedures are tested on a microgrid through PSCAD simulation. The simulation results have demonstrated that the power restoration can be enhanced with the aid of distributed generation (DG) in the MG; the restoration time can also be reduced. An application of DG in restoring power after major emergencies can greatly improve reliability of power supply...|$|R
40|$|A {{major focus}} of the Western European Transmission System Operators (TSO’s) is {{reinforcing}} their crossborder power capacity for mutual support in case of emergencies and also as an beneficial good that can be traded on specialised energy markets. The Belgian TSO, Elia, is studying the use of new and emerging technologies, together with their advantages and disadvantages, for further development of the interconnections with the neighbouring countries. High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology, and especially the promising Multilevel Modular Converters (MMC) for the Voltage Sources Converters (VSC) opened {{a wide range of}} new opportunities. The NEMO project, a 1000 MW undersea link with the United Kingdom, is the object of interest for this paper. A quite similar link, technology-wise, but with other motivations and challenges, is the ALEGRO-link, with a rating of 1000 MW as well. Both installations will be connected to the meshed 400 kV-grid. The paper gives an overview of the technical choices and obstacles that are made, their motivations both for the AC/DC converter and the subsea cable. For the converter and its connection to the main grid, specifically the Belgian side, the main focus will lay on the choice of converter technology between the two concurring state-of-the-art technologies based on thyristor and IGBT topologies. The drastic reduction of the operation losses over the years, lesser footprint, absence for the need of reactive power and additional filtering, grid support in voltage and frequency, the possibility for <b>blackstarting,</b> and by nature the most adapted technology for meshed DC grids, made the technology decision sway {{in the direction of the}} MMC VSC configuration. The subsea power link side of the project contains a set of particular obstacles as well. First of all: the cable routing. This part of the North Sea, close to the harbours of Zeebruges, Antwerp and Rotterdam, is one of the world’s most used sea routes. The selection of the cable route needed to be chose for minimal interaction with the present maritime transport (e. g. anchor dragging, compass deviations), with existing pipe line and telecom routes, detected ship wrecks, environmental protected zones (onshore as well as offshore) and future possible development of the HV network in the sea. The paper will present the major outcomes for the cable routing: offshore route on the seabed, the necessary landfalls and the onshore route to the HVDC substation on the Belgian side. In the second subsection on the power link, the choice of the technical characteristics of the DC power cables together with their performance requirements are highlighted. An overview of the major specification will is presented together with their motivations. Again, two concurring technologies are available on the market: the mass-impregnated (MI) cables, with their higher possible voltage rating, are weighed against the synthetic XLPE cable, which, even though still lower in voltage rating, provide some exceptional long-term opportunities. The paper concludes with a listing of necessary step to be taken and technical challenges to be overcome to make this project a success. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{power systems}} {{are among the}} most {{critical}} infrastructures of modern societies. The interruption of electric supply may cause great adverse impact on the economy of modern societies. For the sustainable development of modern societies, power systems have been undergoing a paradigm shift towards more environmentally-friendly, economic, reliable and resilient modern power grids. Power system restoration has been identified {{as one of the most}} important enabling technologies to achieve one of the aforementioned desirable features, i. e., resilience, of modern power grids. The contribution of this thesis is to apply both new types of components and the state-of-the-art optimization/computation technologies to establish restoration strategies, considering a large spectrum of technical constraints in power systems. This thesis extends the methodology entitled “Generic Restoration Milestones” (GRMs) by implementing the following milestones, including Serve Load in Area, Synchronize Electrical Islands, Establish Transmission Grid, and Form Black_Start_Non_Black_Start Building Blocks. The implementation of each milestone is based on configurable optimization models considering new types of components. Thus, the restoration strategies obtained by these models are generic for various power system characteristics, and adaptive to actual outage scenarios. First, a methodology to establish and validate a complete load restoration strategy is proposed. This methodology models the load restoration as a multi-stage decision-making process considering the operational constraints of generating units. At each stage, a mixed-integer nonlinear load restoration model (MINLR) is formulated to maximize load pickup subject to comprehensive realistic constraints. A complete load restoration strategy is obtained by solving a number of MINLR models in series. A branch-and-cut (B&C) solver is constructed to solve MINLR models efficiently. The theoretical basis of this B&C solver, including the convexification of power flow equations and the applicability of cutting planes, is established. The optimal generation dispatch is then modelled as a dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) model and solved by a direct solution method based on the interior point algorithm. The frequency stability and transient stability of the obtained load restoration strategy is validated by an efficient time-domain simulators based on Graphics Processing Units. Second, a novel methodology entitled “virtual synchroscope” is proposed. Assuming a full observability obtained from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), the proposed methodology compares voltage phasors at the synchronizing points of two electrical islands with the accurately time-stamped measurements. Thus, a smooth synchronization can be implemented. A sufficient condition for full observability of static state estimation with PMUs is provided. Finally, the application of fast cut back (FCB) thermal units and high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission systems in power system restoration is investigated. The benefits of FCB units as <b>blackstart</b> sources are quantified by a bi-level optimization algorithm to minimize the <b>blackstart</b> duration. A non-divergent power flow model with HVDC systems based on nonlinear programming is established to quantify the feasibility of using HVDC links in power system restoration. In summary, this thesis has developed anarray of optimization models and efficient computational methods to establish generic and adaptive restoration strategies. The proposed models and methods can be extended for online applications to realize resilient power grids. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The {{features}} of the Power System Restoration (PSR) problem, i. e. its combinatorial nature, the use of knowledge from {{a broad range of}} sources and of different types along with the number of criteria to satisfy, make it a very difficult decision making process. This paper aims at proposing an innovative approach to provide support to system planners and operators when a blackout occurs and enable a qualitative analysis of the feasibility of the restoration procedures followed. The approach employs an extension of the model-based Petri Nets theory -Hierarchical Time-Extended Petri Nets, H-EPNs, a valuable graphical and mathematical modeling tool applicable to many areas. As a graphical tool, PNs {{can be used as a}} visual-communication aid similar to flow charts, block diagrams, and networks with the additional ability to simulate the dynamic and concurrent activities of systems utilising tokens. As a mathematical tool, it is possible to set up state equations, algebraic equations, and other mathematical models governing the behaviour of systems. System Restoration itself is a hierarchical problem. It embodies an inherent 'time hierarchy' associated with the determination and execution of the restorative control actions in the various stages of system reestablishment. The hierarchical modeling approach used by H-EPNs facilitates the re-energization of the system and leads to restoration plans which are better structured and easier to modify, while a better decision-making process can be achieved. For the formulation of the restoration strategies, the hierarchical modeling utilizing H-EPNs follows three phases: 1. top-down decomposition of the system into a set of component nets, 2. component net modeling, and 3. bottom-up synthesis of the system H-EPN model. The top-down decomposition is accomplished by a functional breakdown of the overall restoration process that eventually leads to a set of well defined operations common in diverse restoration strategies. In the final stage, after the H-EPN subnet for each generic restoration action has been validated, the resulting overall H-EPN power system model can be constructed by using bottom-up synthesis techniques. Indicatively, the suggested H-EPN model for the energize line subnet is demonstrated in Figure 1. The token in place p 1 indicates entry into the subnet. The problems of transient voltage, sustained overvolt-age and charging current that may appear during energization of long lightly loaded transmission lines are checked within the H-EPN model with the aid of the decision places, p 3, p 6 and p 9. If an operating constraint is violated, the model will suggest a modification to the plan in the form of a ""corrective action"", depending on the actual status of the system. The proposed H-EPN framework has been applied to investigate the <b>blackstart</b> procedures following the 1989 blackout of the Hellenic power system. A synthesis of the primitive restoration actions (subnets) has been performed. The places and the corresponding transitions of the model illustrate the restoration actions of unit <b>blackstart,</b> bus energization, line energization, load pickup and unit crank that take place during island reintegration. This is achieved through a cascade connection of the predefined subnets. H-EPN based platform can be used as a planning restoration tool for studying various scenarios It can be implemented as a decision support system for the power system operator in order to: i) help him choose among various ways of initiating the restoration ii) propose several alternative courses of action for a given system condition, iii) assist him in selecting intermediate restoration objectives, iv) alert him when dan-gerous situations arise, v) explain how the system arrived at these alternatives with schematic visualization, vi) evaluate the feasibility of alternative restoration strategies based on analytical tabulated data from off-line studies in conjunction with H-EPN structural properties, vii) display the applicable - pre-defmed restoration procedures. At the present stage, the developed H-EPN model can be used for PSR planning, in an off-line, stand-alone mode. The encoded reasoning in the H-EPN model is based on logical interrelations represented by multiple classes of places and transitions. The issue of path finding is addressed with predefined paths assumed to be available during system rebuilt These switching sequences are based on established practices. Ongoing work concerns the development of an integrated software environment which will make use of the specialized Petri Net software and at the same time will be able to interchange data and results from system simulation programs In this way a more accurate checking of the feasibility of the restoration actions will be possible. At its ultimate stage, H-EPN modeling could be viewed as an interactive assistant to the operator, being part of a sophisticated decision-support environment. (Figure Presented) Figure 1.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P EE 2015 Hou 115 pages :illustrationsThis thesis {{deals with}} both system {{restoration}} and load modelling issues in modern power system. With increased penetration of renewables and upgrade of network complexity in modern grid environment, a resilient and efficient restoration strategy is increasingly desired to enhance system reliability. As {{one of the}} most important tasks for power system planning and operation, power system restoration is regarded as a multi-objective and multi-stage nonlinear constrained optimization problem involving a great number of generation, transmission, distribution and load constraints. For simplifying problem formulation, the process is usually divided into three stages: preparation, system restoration and load restoration, with emphasis on different restoration objective for each stage. A restoration strategy is attained for dispatchers to start <b>blackstart</b> units, establish transmission path to crank non-blackstart units and pick up necessary loads. In existing methodologies, a strategy usually provides optimal starting timetable for all <b>blackstart</b> and non-blackstart units based on fixed time interval timeline in a way that the overall system generation capability is maximized. The insufficiency of this strategy is the inflexibility of the resultant restoration plan due to the assumption that the operation time for each transmission line and the whole restoration time horizon are preassigned fixed values. In modern power system environment, resilience and efficiency are critical and desirable features for electric power system recovery. Consequently, another variable factor of flexible transmission line operation time is taken into consideration while ensuring grid security at the same time, and a novel methodology named optimal efficiency oriented power system restoration has been developed. The proposed efficiency oriented model consists of transmission path search module, operation time calculation module, startup constraints checking module and load pickup module. Particularly, the operation time calculation module is designed to generate a random time matrix T for modeling variable transmission line operation time which complies with beta distribution. Based on this time matrix, power system restoration is formulated as a permutation-based optimization problem. Different from traditional objective of maximizing available generation capability, the proposed novel optimization objective is to maximize available generation capability per unit time named as restoration efficiency for adapting flexible restoration period. Moreover, the optimization solution in terms of non-blackstart units startup permutation is solved through one optimization process for generator startup permutation and transmission restoration path. For practical application, a flexible restoration schedule is generated according to the optimal solution, and provides information of non-blackstart generator startup timing, charging path and corresponding available generation at each restoration stage. Another contribution is development of a tailored algorithm referred as advanced quantum-inspired differential evolutionary algorithm (AQDE) to solve the proposed permutation-based restoration model. It features with better population diversity and quicker convergence speed. The superior performance of AQDE has been benchmarked through comparison experiments with two other well established meta-heuristic techniques including QDE and GA. Consequently, the proposed AQDE method is successfully applied to solve the system restoration of IEEE 39 and 118 bus systems respectively. The optimal efficiency oriented power system restoration methodology is also applied on load restoration stage after its validation on the aforementioned system restoration stage. Traditionally at load restoration stage, maximization of restored load becomes primary objective. When applying the proposed novel methodology, however, maximization of restored load per unit time is designed as the optimization objective. In order to reduce the impacts of service disruption on load loss, load prioritization should be taken into consideration in load pickup process. In general, electrical loads can be divided into three levels based on reliability requirements by customers. Load importance degree is defined according to properly ranking the prioritization of loads with reference to pre-signed contracts with customers, where the expected service quality has been specified. Based on the undirected power system topology model, a novel index Ps combining load prioritization and capacitance is proposed for searching optimal path. Finally, a flexible restoration schedule is obtained to provide information for generator startup and load pickup considering load prioritization. The proposed restoration methodology is applied on IEEE 39 and 57 bus systems respectively. The second part of my research work is load modeling. It is an important issue due to the fact that load model significantly affects power system dynamic simulations. In modern power system, there is increasingly desire of delicate load model with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. A delicate load model is called for to capture specific load characteristics of various load components. To catch these characteristics, a complete load model at distribution grid level consisting of equivalent capacitor, large motor and small motor is proposed. Furthermore, the other two models, namely the composite load model and dynamic load model at distribution grid level, are applied to assess the accuracy of the developed complete load model. The comparisons of simulation on case studies have demonstrated that the complete load model has superior performance in transient simulations at distribution grid level and capable to capture more accurate load characteristics than the other two models.

40|$|Generation {{scheduling}} in restructured {{electric power}} systems {{is critical to}} maintain the stability and security of a power system and economical operation of the electricity market. However, new generation scheduling problems (GSPs) are emerging under critical or new circumstances, such as generator starting sequence and black-start (BS) generator installation problems in power system restoration (PSR), and generation operational planning considering carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission regulation. This dissertation proposes new optimization techniques to investigate these new GSPs that do not fall into the traditional categories. Resilience and efficient recovery are critical and desirable features for electric power systems. Smart grid technologies are expected to enable a grid to be restored from major outages efficiently and safely. As a result, power system restoration is increasingly important for system planning and operation. In this dissertation, the optimal generator start-up strategy is developed to provide the starting sequence of all BS or non-black-start (NBS) generating units to maximize the overall system generation capability. Then, based on the developed method to estimate the total restoration time and system generation capability, the optimal installation strategy of <b>blackstart</b> capabilities is proposed for system planners to develop the restoration plan and achieve an efficient restoration process. Therefore, a new decision support tool for system restoration has been developed to assist system restoration planners and operators to restore generation and transmission systems in an on-line environment. This tool is able to accommodate rapidly changing system conditions {{in order to avoid}} catastrophic outages. Moreover, to achieve the goal of a sustainable and environment-friendly power grid, CO 2 mitigation policies, such as CO 2 cap-and-trade, help to reduce consumption in fossil energy and promote a shift to renewable energy resources. The regulation of CO 2 emissions for electric power industry to mitigate global warming brings a new challenge to generation companies (GENCOs). In a competitive market environment, GENCOs can schedule the maintenance periods to maximize their profits. Independent System Operator 2 ̆ 7 s (ISO) functionality is also considered from the view point of system reliability and cost minimization. Considering these new effects of CO 2 emission regulation, GENCOs need to adjust their scheduling strategies in the electricity market and bidding strategies in CO 2 allowance market. This dissertation proposes a formulation of the emission-constrained GSP and its solution methodology involving generation maintenance scheduling, unit commitment, and CO 2 cap-and-trade. The coordinated optimal maintenance scheduling and CO 2 allowance bidding strategy is proposed to provide valuable information for GENCOs 2 ̆ 7 decision makings in both electricity and CO 2 allowance markets.

40|$|Economic {{development}} in the United States depends on a reliable and affordable power supply. The nation will need well educated engineers to design a modern, safe, secure, and reliable power grid for our future needs. An anticipated shortage of qualified engineers has caused considerable concern in many professional circles, and various steps are being taken nationwide to alleviate the potential shortage and ensure the North American power system's reliability, and our world-wide economic competitiveness. To help provide a well-educated and trained workforce which can sustain and modernize the nation's power grid, Gonzaga University's School of Engineering and Applied Science has established a five-course (15 -credit hour) Certificate Program in Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Engineering. The program has been specifically designed to provide working utility engineering professionals with on-line access to advanced engineering courses which cover modern design practice with an industry-focused theoretical foundation. A total of twelve courses have been developed to-date and students may select any five in their area of interest for the T&D Certificate. As each course is developed and taught {{by a team of}} experienced engineers (from public and private utilities, consultants, and industry suppliers), students are provided a unique opportunity to interact directly with different industry experts over the eight weeks of each course. Course material incorporates advanced aspects of civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering disciplines that apply to power system design and are appropriate for graduate engineers. As such, target students for the certificate program include: (1) recent graduates with a Bachelor of Science Degree in an engineering field (civil, mechanical, electrical, etc.); (2) senior engineers moving from other fields to the utility industry (i. e. paper industry to utility engineering or project management positions); and (3) regular working professionals wishing to update their skills or increase their knowledge of utility engineering design practices and procedures. By providing graduate educational opportunities for the above groups, the T&D Program will help serve a strong industry need for training the next generation of engineers in the cost-effective design, construction, operation, and maintenance of modern electrical transmission and distribution systems. In addition to developing the on-line engineering courses described above, the T&D Program also focused significant efforts towards enhancing the training opportunities available to power system operators in the northwest. These efforts have included working with outside vendors to provide NERC-approved training courses in Gonzaga University's (GU) system operator training facility, support for an accurate system model which can be used in regional <b>blackstart</b> exercises, and the identification of a retired system operator who could provide actual regional training courses. The GU system operator training facility is also being used to recruit young workers, veterans, and various under-represented groups to the utility industry. Over the past three years students from Columbia Gorge Community College, Spokane Falls Community College, Walla Walla Community College, Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Gonzaga University, and various local high schools have attended short (one-day) system operator training courses free of charge. These collaboration efforts has been extremely well received by both students and industry, and meet T&D Program objectives of strengthening the power industry workforce while bridging the knowledge base across power worker categories, and recruiting new workers to replace a predominantly retirement age workforce. In the past three years the T&D Program has provided over 170 utility engineers with access to advanced engineering courses, been involved in training more than 300 power system operators, and provided well over 500 college and high school students with an experience in running a power system simulator and an exposure to various utility-related professions and craft trades...|$|E
