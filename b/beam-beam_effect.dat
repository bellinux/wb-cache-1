40|$|The {{collective}} <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> {{can potentially}} cause a {{rapid growth of}} beam sizes and reduce the luminosity of a collider to an unacceptably low level. The ELIC, a proposed ultra high luminosity electron-ion collider based on CEBAF, employs high repetition rate crab crossing colliding beams with very small bunch transverse sizes and very short bunch lengths, and collides them at up to 4 interaction points with strong final focusing. All of these features can make the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> challenging. In this paper, we present simulation studies of the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> in ELIC using a self-consistent strong-strong beam-beam simulation code developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

40|$|Long-range <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> {{occurred}} in the Tevatron at all stages (injection, ramp, squeeze, and collisions) and affected both proton and antiproton beams. They resulted in beam losses and emittance blow-ups, which {{occurred in}} remarkable bunch-to-bunch dependent patterns. On the way to record-high luminosities of the collider, many {{issues related to the}} long-range beam-beam interactions have been addressed. Below we present a short overview of the long-range <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> in the Tevatron.

40|$|The term <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> {{is usually}} used to {{designate}} different phenomena associated with interactions of counter-rotating beams in storage rings. Typically, the authors speak about <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> when such interactions {{lead to an}} increase of the beam core size or to a reduction of the beam lifetime or to a growth of particle`s population in the beam halo and a correspondent increase of the background. Although observations of <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> are very similar in most storage rings, it is very likely that every particular case is largely unique and machine-dependent. This constitutes one of the problems in studying the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects,</b> because the experimental results are often obtained without characterizing a machine {{at the time of the}} experiment. Such machine parameters as a dynamic aperture, tune dependencies on amplitude of particle oscillations and energy, betatron phase advance between the interaction points and some others are not well known, thus making later analysis uncertain. The authors begin their discussion with demonstrations that <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> are closely related to non linear resonances. Then, they will show that a non linearity of the space charge field is responsible for the excitation of these resonances. After that, they will consider how <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> could be intensified by machine imperfections. Then, they will discuss a leading mechanism for the formation of the beam halo and will describe a new technique for beam tails and lifetime simulations. They will finish with a brief discussion of the coherent <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{luminosity}} of the eRHIC ring-ring {{design is}} limited by the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> exerted on the electron beam.

This scheme requires proper design of the electron ring, providing the correct betatron phase advance between interaction point and electron lens.

40|$|The Fermilab {{accelerator}} {{complex is}} in the middle of an upgrade plan Fermilab III. In the last phase of this upgrade the luminosity of the Tevatron will increase by at least one order of magnitude.

40|$|We present {{considerations}} {{about the}} transverse beam transfer function (BTF) of beams {{under the influence}} of two effects: The strong-strong <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> and the influence of a Gaussian electron lens. The BTF are investigated using two methods: BTF excitation is simulated in a particle-in-cell (PIC) code. The BTF model is verified using a known analytic expectation. Analytic expectations for BTF of beams under a stationary electron lens are derived by extending BTF from the formalism of Berg and Ruggiero. Finally we compare the analytic BTF results for a stationary Gaussian lens to both the PIC simulation for split tune conditions and to PIC simulations for a beam influenced by an electron lens. We conclude that the formalism represents the electron lens well and can be applied to a limited extend to the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> under split tune conditions. The analytic formalism allows us to recover the strength of an electron lens by means of fitting and can give clues regarding the strength of the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect</b> under split tune conditions.

40|$|Long-range <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> are a {{potential}} {{limit to the}} LHC performance with the nominal design parameters, and certain upgrade scenarios under discussion.

40|$|The maximum {{achievable}} luminosity in the LHC {{is mainly}} limited by <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects.</b> The {{large number of}} bunches and their head-on and long range interactions determine the maximum allowable bunch intensity. Furthermore, the arrangement of bunches in the LHC ring imply further complications: the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> on a given particle depend on its bunch position in the LHC bunch train and result in the appearance of so-called PACMAN bunches which can have a different dynamic behaviour and life time.

40|$|The thesis project aims at {{studying}} the different physical {{processes that are}} impacting luminosity, {{one of the key}} figures of merit of a collider operation. In particular the project focuses on extracting the most relevant parameters for the high-energy part of the model, which is mostly dominated by the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect.</b> LHC luminosity is degraded by parasitic collisions that reduce the beam lifetime and the particles stability in the collider. This instability is due to the non-linear effects of one beam electromagnetic field on another in the interaction region. Such parasitic encounters can be as many as 16 per interaction region, piling up to around 180 000 per second. Our goal is to study the evolution of charge density distribution in the beam, by tracking particles through a symplectic integrator that includes the <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effect.</b> In particular we want to obtain data on the halo particles, which are more sensible to instability, to better characterise the beam lifetime and monitor the luminosity evolution...|$|E

40|$|In storage-ring colliders, it {{has been}} a first {{priority}} to achieve the highest possible luminosity in order to provide adequate physical data for research in high- energy and nuclear physics. The luminosity is usually limited by <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> {{especially in the case of}} high-intensity beams. Therefore understanding <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> is important to achieve high luminosity in storage-ring colliders. Theoretically, a complete understanding of <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> requires a relevant solution of the nonlinear Vlasov equation that describes the evolution of phase- space distributions of beam particles. Unfortunately no analytic method of solving the Vlasov equation in the relevant conditions of a storage-ring is currently available unless some approximations (linearization) are made. However those approximations can distort the genuine picture of the beam dynamics especially in the nonlinear regime (nonintegrable) of the Vlasov equation. On the other hand, the advance of computer technology and computational physics has made it possible to study beam- beam effects with numerical simulation in a scenario that is much closer to a real situation. A self-consistent beam-beam simulation code has therefore been developed using the particle-in-cell method. In the simulation, both head-on and long-range beam-beam interactions as well as multipole error fields in magnets of an accelerator can be included. The simulation results have been compared with the experiments in the HERA, which showed a remarkable agreement in the luminosity, emittance and coherent beam-beam tune shifts. In this dissertation, some important aspects of <b>beam-beam</b> <b>effects</b> were studied mainly by beam-beam simulations. Topics include the coherent beam-beam tune shift of the unsymmetrical beam-beam interaction, the coherent beam- beam instability of the strong-weak beam-beam interaction, the importance of the beam-beam tune spread to the coherent (collective) beam-beam instability and the wire compensation of long-range beam-beam interactions in the LHC...|$|R
