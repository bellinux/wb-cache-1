Both salts investigated in this work, KI and NaI, exhibited a salting-out effect on acetone. The experimental data for the salt-free system were correlated by Wilson, NRTL and UNIQUAC models. For the salt systems, the experimental data were correlated by the electrolytic NRTL model of Mock et al. [Mock, B., Evans, L. B. and Chen, C. C., 1986. AIChE J., 32 : 1655 - 1664], the extended UNIQUAC equation of Sander et al. [Sander, B., Fredenslund, A. and Rasmussen, P., 1986. Chem. Eng.

50|$|By {{properly}} {{managing the}} production rates, greater benefits {{can be had}} from solution gas drives. Secondary recovery involves the injection of gas or water to maintain reservoir pressure.

This novel mesh generation process consists of three sub-processes: (a) definition of geometric model, i. e. analysis model, (b) generation of bubbles, and (c) generation of elements. One of commercial solid modelers is employed for three-dimensional crack structures. Bubble is generated if its distance from existing <b>bubble</b> <b>points</b> {{is similar to the}} bubble spacing function at the <b>point.</b> The <b>bubble</b> spacing function is well controlled by the fuzzy knowledge processing.

50|$|In {{mixtures}} of substances, the <b>bubble</b> <b>point</b> is the saturated liquid temperature, whereas the saturated vapor temperature {{is called the}} dew point. Because the bubble and dew lines of a zeotropic mixture's temperature-composition diagram do not intersect, a zeotropic mixture in its liquid phase has a different fraction of a component than the gas phase of the mixture. On a temperature-composition diagram, after a mixture in its liquid phase is heated to the temperature at the bubble (boiling) curve, the fraction of a component in the mixture changes along an isothermal line connecting the dew curve to the boiling curve as the mixture boils. At any given temperature, {{the composition of the}} liquid is the composition at the <b>bubble</b> <b>point,</b> whereas the composition of the vapor is the composition at the dew point. Unlike azeotropic mixtures, there is no azeotropic point at any temperature on the diagram where the bubble line and dew lines would intersect. Thus, the composition of the mixture will always change between the bubble and dew point component fractions upon boiling from a liquid to a gas until the mass fraction of a component reaches 1 (i.e. the zeotropic mixture is completely separated into its pure components). As shown in Figure 1, the mole fraction of component 1 decreases from 0.4 to around 0.15 as the liquid mixture boils to the gas phase.|$|E

Within this temperature range, bubble-point pressures up to 5 bar were observed.

5000|$|If {{one wants}} to {{represent}} a VLE data for a three-component mixture as a boiling point [...] "diagram", a three-dimensional graph can be used. Two of the dimensions {{would be used to}} represent the composition mole fractions, and the third dimension would be the temperature. Using two dimensions, the composition can be represented as an equilateral triangle in which each corner represents one of the pure components. The edges of the triangle represent a mixture of the two components {{at each end of the}} edge. Any point inside the triangle represents the composition of a mixture of all three components. The mole fraction of each component would correspond to where a point lies along a line starting at that component's corner and perpendicular to the opposite edge. The <b>bubble</b> <b>point</b> and dew point data would become curved surfaces inside a triangular prism, which connect the three boiling points on the vertical temperature [...] "axes". Each face of this triangular prism would represent a two-dimensional boiling-point diagram for the corresponding binary mixture. Due to their three-dimensional complexity, such boiling-point diagrams are rarely seen. Alternatively, the three-dimensional curved surfaces can be represented on a two-dimensional graph by the use of curved isotherm lines at graduated intervals, similar to iso-altitude lines on a map. Two sets of such isotherm lines are needed on such a two-dimensional graph: one set for the <b>bubble</b> <b>point</b> surface and another set for the dew point surface.|$|E
