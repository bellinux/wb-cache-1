5|$|Chrono Resurrection, {{also known}} as Chrono Trigger: Resurrection, is an {{unreleased}} fangame developed by North American team Resurrection Games under Nathan Lazur's direction. It {{is based on the}} critically acclaimed Super NES role-playing game Chrono Trigger by the Japanese company Square. The project was initially called CT64 and was meant to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> remake of the original game for the Nintendo 64, with both 2D and 3D playing modes.|$|E
5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value, would have made an excellent choice. From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> coincidence.|$|E
3000|$|On C(Λ,X) we {{consider}} the generalized metric d_∞ (that is, d_∞:C(Λ,X)× C(Λ,X)→[0,∞]) defined by d_∞(f,g):= _α∈Λd(f(α),g(α)). Note that (C(Λ,X), d_∞) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> generalized metric space if (X,d) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> metric space and (CB(Λ,X),d_∞) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> metric space if (X,d) [...] is so.|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, (X,d) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> metric space if {{and only}} if (X,M^d) (or (X,M^e)) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> FMS. For instance, this is the case for any nonempty closed subset of ℝ {{provided}} with its Euclidean metric.|$|R

25|$|In December 2004, {{attempts}} {{to persuade the}} IRA to disarm entirely collapsed when the Democratic Unionist Party, under Ian Paisley, insisted on photographic evidence.

25|$|In April 2006, {{producer}} Dino Elefante told Jesus Freak Hideout that Guardian {{would release}} Triple Five, a compilation {{with a couple}} new songs on the Selectric Records imprint that he had partnered with Bach. More recently, Jamie Rowe said that there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> CD of all new material rather than Triple Five. However, these plans were put on hold when Selectric Records was sold to Weston Entertainment.|$|E
5000|$|There <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> {{recursive}} {{characterization of}} local complete intersection rings that can <b>be</b> used as <b>a</b> definition, as follows. Suppose that R <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> Noetherian local ring. If R has dimension greater than 0 and x <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{element in the}} maximal ideal that <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> zero divisor then R <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> intersection ring {{if and only if}} R/(x) is. (If the maximal ideal consists entirely of zero divisors then R <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> intersection ring.) If R has dimension 0, then [...] showed that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> intersection ring if and only if the Fitting ideal of its maximal ideal is non-zero.|$|R

25|$|Subsequently lost, the Risley Park Lanx re-emerged in the 1990s, as a {{supposed}} heirloom of the now-notorious art forger Shaun Greenhalgh and his family. Bought by private buyers and {{donated to the}} British Museum, it was on display for several years, but was removed when its authenticity became suspect. It was later determined to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> fabrication. The fate of the original, genuine, Risley Park Lanx is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Oration {{also served}} as an {{introduction}} to Pico's 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are {{a good example of}} humanist syncretism, because Pico combined Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> system of physics.|$|E
25|$|Bullshit {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> fabrication. While a lie is related by a speaker who believes what is said is false, bullshit is offered by a speaker who does not care whether what is said is true because the speaker {{is more concerned with}} giving the hearer some impression. Thus bullshit may be either true or false, but demonstrates a lack of concern for the truth which is likely to lead to falsehoods.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of privileged groups may not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> {{solution to the}} free rider problem, however, as underproduction of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making {{it possible that the}} street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} set X {{needs to be}} defined as a subset of a {{partially}} ordered set Y that is also a topological space in order for these definitions to make sense. Moreover, it has to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> lattice so that the suprema and infima always exist. In that case every set has a limit superior and a limit inferior. Also note that the limit inferior and the limit superior of a set {{do not have to be}} elements of the set.|$|E
25|$|The {{currently}} accepted theory describing elementary {{particles and}} their interactions {{is known as}} the standard model of particle physics. This theory provides a unified description of three of the fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Despite its remarkable success in explaining a wide range of physical phenomena, the standard model cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> description of reality. This is because the standard model fails to incorporate the force of gravity and because of problems such as the hierarchy problem and the inability to explain the structure of fermion masses or dark matter.|$|E

25|$|Warfield, however, was {{not content}} with what seemed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> Seaboard system in Florida, {{and at the end}} of 1925, {{announced}} two new extensions, one from West Palm Beach to Miami and another from Arcadia to Fort Myers and Naples. Groundbreaking for the Miami extension took place in Hialeah in January 1926, and by December 1926, the line was open for freight. From January 7 though January 9, 1927, Warfield took a large faction of dignitaries on a special run of the crack Seaboard train the Orange Blossom Special, beginning at Arcadia and proceeding south to Naples, then doubling back over to the east coast and proceeding south from West Palm Beach to Miami.|$|E
25|$|A-Eon Technology is {{a privately}} funded company co-founded by Trevor Dickinson. The focus of A-Eon {{was on the}} {{high-end}} and a partnership with Hyperion Entertainment was formed to allow discussion with key AmigaOS 4 developers about what such a next generation AmigaOS 4 computer would need. With {{the end of the}} AmigaONE line from Eyetech and lack of success porting the OS to third party machines, A-Eon decided to continue the AmigaONE line themselves with more up to date technology. One important decision made during this early phase was that the AmigaOne X1000 should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> system built around a bespoke motherboard with a customised case and peripherals. This contrasts with the adapted reference design strategy used by Eyetech for the original AmigaOne series.|$|E
25|$|Since Pedro II {{would only}} be 18 in 1843, an elected regency was created to replace the emperor during his minority. The country became {{in all but the}} name a republic. Joaquim Nabuco, writing in the 1890s, remarked that the Brazilian {{republicans}} saw this period as their chance to prove that the country could survive in peace without a monarch as superior arbiter, as a neutral character above rival parties. However, this republican experience proved itself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> disaster: as a republic, Brazil was no better than its Hispanic-American neighbors. The regency had little effective authority which resulted in nine years of chaos during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} other {{mathematical}} concepts {{that can be}} used to represent complete lattices. One means of doing so is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. When this completion <b>is</b> applied to <b>a</b> poset that already <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> lattice, then the result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> lattice of sets which is isomorphic to the original one. Thus we immediately find that every complete lattice <b>is</b> isomorphic to <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> lattice of sets.|$|R
