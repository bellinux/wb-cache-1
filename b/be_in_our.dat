500|$|Beecham quickly {{concluded}} that {{to compete with}} the two existing London orchestras, the Queen's Hall Orchestra and the recently founded London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls. [...] For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen's Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as [...] "even more certain to deter the public then than it would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own day". [...] The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were d'Indy's symphonic ballad La forêt enchantée, Smetana's symphonic poem Šárka, and Lalo's little-known Symphony in G minor. [...] Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.|$|E
500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and I wonder if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E

[...] The Arsenal manager claimed that Rooney told his players that he felt no contact, but the referee {{made the decision to}} give Manchester United a penalty which he called the turning point of the match. Wenger used statistics to question Riley's impartiality – of the referee's last eight matches at Old Trafford, he awarded eight penalties to the home team. Wenger was not surprised at United's rough treatment of Reyes – [...] "That's what they always try against us when they're in a difficult situation" [...] and accused Van Nistelrooy of being a cheat in his post-match television interview. Vieira, like his manager, was disappointed in Riley's handling of the match, but sought positives: [...] "We're still eight points clear of United and two points clear of Chelsea. We're in a really good position and all the other teams would want to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> position." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E

The Skylink was designed and built to accommodate Terminal F, as the track follows a roughly semicircular path over the parking lot, similar to its path through the other terminals, instead of running in a straight line between Terminals D and E; with straight sections that are long enough to allow for station platforms.

After this the fun soon becomes fast and furious — too furious to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> judgment characteristic of the author's happiest manner. [...] There is certainly a good deal of drollery in Foggerty's interview with Malvina de Vere, and their friendly steps towards an action for breach of promise. [...] But there is almost too much of it, and there is certainly too much of the satire upon mad-doctors and their ways which occurs when Foggerty's friends believe him demented, and try to get a certificate to that effect from Dr. Lobb and Dr. Dobb. The climax, therefore, which is brought about when the hero takes a pill, summons the fairy once more, and brings matters back to their status quo, is very welcome, for towards the last the fun is felt to be flagging. [...] The mad dream has been almost too long as well as too elaborate in its absurdities. [...] This fault, if it be found to exist, can, of course, be readily remedied, as there seems no real need for the hero's false confession, à la Topsy, of a crime which he never committed.|$|E

2500|$|Facing the {{possibility}} of defeat in the 2012 Presidential election the Obama Administration accelerated work {{in the weeks before}} the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures. The work to codify U.S. drone policy began in summer 2011. [...] "There was concern that the levers might no longer <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hands," [...] said one unnamed U.S official. With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an [...] "amorphous" [...] program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mitt Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said. [...] "One of the things we've got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in terms of some of the decisions that we're making," [...] Obama said and added [...] "creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, {{is going to be a}} challenge for me and my successors for some time to come." [...] U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. [...] "There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In the humiliating {{aftermath}} of Suez in 1956, Lady Avon's most famous public remark {{to a group}} of Conservative woman that, [...] "in the past few weeks I have really felt as if the Suez Canal was flowing through my drawing room", was widely reported. Lady Avon has since described this observation as [...] "silly, really idiotic", though it remains probably the most quoted utterance of the whole crisis. One example of its durability was a journalist's observation some 54 years later, with reference to the Iraq War of 2003, that [...] "if, as Clarissa Eden remarked, the Suez Canal ran through her drawing room, Iraq and the decisions that flowed from it still haunt [...] Labour [...] and stir up antipathies and discomforts". Another instance was in 2013 when options for airport expansion around London were being debated. Journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of London's mayor Boris Johnson, recalled Lady Avon's remark and added, [...] "But for those of us in West London, any further expansion to Heathrow and the airport really will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> back yards". More directly, The Times newspaper cited Lady Avon's words in 2011 in connection with a call by the outgoing Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus (later Lord) O'Donnell for Prime Ministerial spouses to receive greater support from public funds: [...] "In a constitutional monarchy, the consort of the prime minister is not an official role ... Yet, as the Countess of Avon so vividly pointed out, it can be impossible to keep public scrutiny at bay altogether". In Lady Avon's view, both she and her husband [...] "were quite naive about how the press works. Neither of us should have been, but we were." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discrimination on {{the basis}} of race or {{ethnicity}} was legally sanctioned until 1975. Australia's new official policy on racial diversity is: [...] "to build on our success as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united through a shared future". The White Australia Policy continues to be mentioned in modern contexts, although it is generally only mentioned by politicians when denouncing their opposition. As Leader of the Opposition, John Howard argued for restricting Asian immigration in 1988 as part of his One Australia policy; in August 1988, he said: I do believe that if it is – in the eyes of some in the community – that it's too great, it would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it [...] were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.Howard later retracted and apologised for the remarks, and was returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1995. The Howard Government (1996–2007) in turn ran a large programme of non-discriminatory immigration and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Asian countries became an increasingly important source of immigration over the decade from 1996 to 2006, with the proportion of migrants from Southern and Central Asian countries doubling from 7% to 14%. The proportion of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also increased. By 2005–06, China and India were the third and fourth largest sources of all migration (after New Zealand and the United Kingdom). In 2005–06, there were 180,000 permanent additions of migrants to Australia (72% more than the number in 1996–97). This figure included around 17,000 through the humanitarian programme, of whom Iraqis and Sudanese accounted for the largest portions. China became Australia's biggest source of migrants, for the first time in 2009, surpassing New Zealand and Britain.|$|E
