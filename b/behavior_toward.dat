5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E
5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E

The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return that he put a good word for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies.|$|E

50|$|Cross-culturally, {{representational}} {{models of}} gods' minds take {{an array of}} diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, {{or some combination of}} these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods. Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge. The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> other people, (2) <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> the gods themselves and (3) <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> nature and/or the environment. While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges. This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.|$|R

The resulting increase in impunity and decline in security in Avaradrano contributed to declining popular support of his rule.

Oral history describes him as prone to anger and violence, which he did not hesitate to inflict against women and children. He is also said to have frequently seized the property and valuables of his people for his own use without justification or compensation.|$|E
25|$|Because {{relatedness}} differs in haplodiploid species, {{the effects}} of kin selection are predicted to differ {{from that of a}} diploid species. V. pensylvanica is a haplodiploid species. Thus, female offspring have a 0.75 relatedness to their sisters, but only a 0.25 relatedness to their brothers. As a result, kin selection posits that workers will be more inclined to show altruistic <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> sisters than brothers. Further, this implies that a conflict over sex ratio may result, with workers preferring their mothers to have daughters. Because the mother is related equally to sons and daughters, kin selection predicts the mother will not show a preference toward either sex.|$|E

30|$|In the workplace, {{perception}} of women’s communality {{is perceived as}} a predisposition for success at female-typed careers and as an obstacle in male dominated occupations or leadership positions. Moreover, the female communality stereotype can lead to a benevolent sexism towards women comprising “putatively positive beliefs and <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> women that serve to undermine their status” (Rudman and Phelan 2007, p. 24). Benevolent sexism can manifest in the patronizing <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> female colleagues as well as low expectations and standards for women’s excellence and less tangible rewards in male dominated occupations. One of the strategies for women to be accepted and valued in the male dominated occupations and positions is to “actively disconfirm the female gender stereotype by acting ‘more like men’” (ibid., p. 28).|$|R
40|$|Although adults {{generally}} prefer helpful {{behaviors and}} those who perform them, there are situations (in particular, when the target of an action is disliked) in which overt antisocial acts are seen as appropriate, {{and those who}} perform them are viewed positively.

We find that although 5 -mo-old infants uniformly prefer individuals who act positively toward others regardless {{of the status of}} the target, 8 -mo-old infants selectively prefer characters who act positively toward prosocial individuals and characters who act negatively toward antisocial individuals. Additionally, young toddlers direct positive <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> prosocial others and negative <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> antisocial others.

40|$|The {{viability}} of gold open access publishing models {{into the future}} will depend, in part, on the attitudes of authors toward open access (OA). In a survey of academics at four major research universities in North America, we examine academic authors’ opinions and <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> gold OA.

25|$|Elizabeth {{became the}} {{catalyst}} in the uneasy – and ultimate breakup of – the Savage–Hogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan's overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth. At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches {{during the fall}} of 1988, including matches against King Haku, Akeem, and Bad News Brown that aired on Saturday Night's Main Event. In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth's safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, Slick and Akeem's tag-team partner, The Big Boss Man (who wrestled together as The Twin Towers) when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climatic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth's well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan. At the 1988 Survivor Series, Hogan's obviously friendly <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> Elizabeth angered Savage, something pro-heel commentator Jesse Ventura played up during a post-match interview with Savage. Savage emphatically denied any animosity between himself and Hogan, but Savage would become increasingly jealous and wary of Hogan as the weeks went by.|$|E

40|$|Pathological <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> {{drugs and}} food rewards have {{underlying}} commonalities. Risk-taking has a fourfold pattern varying {{as a function}} of probability and valence leading to the nonlinearity of probability weighting with overweighting of small probabilities and underweighting of large probabilities. Here we assess these influences on risk-taking in patients with pathological <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> drug and food rewards and examine structural neural correlates of nonlinearity of probability weighting in healthy volunteers. In the anticipation of rewards, subjects with binge eating disorder show greater risk-taking, similar to substance-use disorders. Methamphetamine-dependent subjects had greater onlinearity of probability weighting along with impaired subjective discrimination of probability and reward magnitude. Ex-smokers also had lower risk-taking to rewards compared with non-smokers. In the anticipation of losses, obesity without binge eating had a similar pattern to other substance-use disorders. Obese subjects with binge eating also have impaired discrimination of subjective value {{similar to that of the}} methamphetamine-dependent subjects. Nonlinearity of probability weighting was associated with lower gray matter volume in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in healthy volunteers. Our findings support a distinct subtype of binge eating disorder in obesity with similarities in risk-taking in the reward domain to substance use disorders. The results dovetail with the current approach of defining mechanistically based dimensional approaches rather than categorical approaches to psychiatric disorders. The relationship to risk probability and valence may underlie the propensity <b>toward</b> pathological <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> different types of reward...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} three factors {{as they relate}} to functioning: selfharm, substance abuse and age. Research has shown girls highest in mid-adolescent selfharm are those who engage in high levels of bullying (Barker, Arseneault, Brendgen, Fontaine, 2 ̆ 6 Maughan, 2008). Little research has been done to analyze specific <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> others among adolescents who self-harm. Dembo, la Voie, Schmeidler, 2 ̆ 6 Washburn (1987) found a positive correlation between antisocial orientation and illicit drug use. Further research was done {{to understand the nature of}} behaviors and functioning of juveniles who abuse substances. Johnson (1988) found a history of substance abuse in the majority of families of children who engaged in sexually abusive behaviors. Juvenile substance abuse may also be correlated with children who engage in sexually abusive behaviors. Previous research suggests age may be a factor in functioning. In a study on bullying, aggressive victims became less prevalent and passive victims and bullies became more prevalent with age (Hanish, 2 ̆ 6 Guerra, 2004). Additionally, inappropriate sexual behaviors may decrease with age. Sexual harassment of same- and opposite-sex peers has been shown to increase over early adolescent years and level off in later high-school years (Pepler, Craig, Connolly, Yuile, McMaster, 2 ̆ 6 Jiang, 2006). The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the relation among selfharm, substance abuse and age {{as they relate to}} functioning.

When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} to do. After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E
25|$|Declines in the {{abundance}} of wild salmon due to over fishing placed greater pressure on hatcheries to increase production and restore the wild salmon stock to supply fisheries. The problem is that hatcheries can never truly replicate the environment of wild salmon, an issue which often results in physiological and behavioral differences between wild salmon and those reared in hatcheries. These differences are often the product of genetic changes associated with inbreeding, artificial selection, and natural selection as well as different environmental pressures acting on hatchery fish than wild populations. Due to the size selective nature of fishing favoring larger fish, a reduction in average size of the adult salmon has been observed over time. The smaller salmon make {{a greater proportion of}} the remaining individuals continuing the population, and problems arise when these hatchery-reared fish are introduced into the wild populations. Unlike wild salmon, larger salmon are selected for in hatcheries and are typically much larger than wild salmon. The result is that hatchery-produced salmon tend to out-compete wild salmon for space, food, and other resources. Some salmon species in hatcheries exhibit predatory <b>behavior</b> <b>toward</b> wild salmon because they grow to be much larger. Regardless of whether predation is observed, natural social interactions are disturbed by the release of large numbers of hatchery-reared salmon where wild populations are low because salmon in hatcheries naturally have a higher propensity towards aggressive behavior. Overall, natural salmon populations are put at risk when hatchery-reared salmon populations are introduced due to competition for resources, predation by larger individuals, and negative social interactions that upset the natural order observed in wild salmon populations. As a result, wild salmon populations are steadily dropping as the pressure to continue breeding salmon in hatcheries increases. Conservation efforts that work to place limitations on hatcheries to increase the wild salmon populations are hindered by financial pressures because hatcheries effectively support many states economically by accounting for over 70% of the salmon harvested for recreational and commercial purposes.|$|E

30|$|The TAM was {{proposed}} by Davis (1986) and Davis et al. (1989) {{on the basis}} of the TPB and the theory of rational behavior to explain users’ acceptance <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> a new technology. Owing to the simplicity of the model and the verification of its value in various empirical studies, the TAM has become widely used in studies on the acceptance of a wide array of information technologies. However, Kim (2007) pointed out that some traditional technology acceptance models are insufficient to explain users’ acceptance <b>behaviors</b> <b>toward</b> new information and communication technology (ICT) (e.g., mobile payment technology) because consumers utilizing new ICT are automatically users of both the technology and the service. Thus, Yang et al. (2012 a) indicated that the validity of some studies has been gradually questioned. In this context, online mobile users are not only adopters of new technology or information systems but also consumers of the mobile value-added service, and, in this case, value maximization is the most basic principle for decision making.|$|R
