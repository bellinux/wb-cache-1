She stood as Labour candidate for Portsmouth South in the general elections of 1923, 1924 and 1929, and for Kidderminster in 1931.|$|E

Six candidates were shortlisted for the nomination, with Siân Berry, the party's {{candidate in}} the 2008 election, selected by London-based members of the Green Party. Unsuccessful nominees were Jonathan Bartley (candidate for Streatham in the 2015 general election, co-founder of Ekklesia, and Work and Pensions Spokesperson for the Green Party); Tom Chance (candidate for Lewisham West and Penge in the 2015 general election and Housing Spokesperson for the Greens); Benali Hamdach (Equalities Spokesperson for the Green Party, and former National Health Service researcher); Rashid Nix (a Camera operator and candidate for Dulwich and West Norwood in the 2015 general election); and Caroline Russell (Islington <b>Borough</b> <b>Councillor</b> for Highbury East Ward since 2014 and clean air campaigner).|$|E

25|$|In World War II, {{the site}} was again used for {{military}} aircraft production, in particular the Vickers Wellington, Vickers Warwick and Hawker Hurricane and was extensively camouflaged. Trees were also planted in some sections of the concrete track to help conceal the Hawker and Vickers aircraft factories there. Despite these efforts, the Vickers factory was successfully bombed by the Luftwaffe and extensively damaged on 4 September 1940 with nearly 90 aircraft workers killed and at least 419 injured. Five unidentified victims were buried in unmarked graves in Burvale Cemetery, Hersham, on 9 September although one of these was later confirmed to be 36 year old William E Hunt. On 10 March 2016, thanks {{to the efforts of}} local residents, sponsors and supporters, permanent memorials to Mr Hunt and the other four civilians were dedicated by the Reverend Martin Fletcher and Elmbridge <b>Borough</b> <b>Councillor</b> Mary Sheldon. Attendees included relatives of Vickers factor worker Eric S Powell who also died on 4 September 1940 aged 26 and is now believed {{to be one of the}} remaining four unidentified casualties buried at Burvale.|$|E
500|$|The present clock tower, {{which has}} a stone spire, was built to replace the one {{destroyed}} in the 1883 fire. It was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in a similar style {{to one of his}} earlier works, the clock tower of Manchester Town Hall. The first stone was laid by Thomas Schofield JP, Alderman and Rochdale <b>Borough</b> <b>Councillor,</b> on 19 October 1885 and the tower was declared complete on 20 June 1887, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It contains five bells which ring on the hour and at 15-minute intervals. The design of the original tower was more elaborate and [...] higher than its successor, which is [...] tall.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] 1931 general election, in the {{nationwide}} rout of Labour, the Jarrow constituency was {{won by the}} National Government's candidate, William Pearson, a Conservative <b>borough</b> <b>councillor</b> and former mayor. In 1932, when the mood in Jarrow was desperate—"a workhouse without walls" [...] according to one commentator—the local Labour Party selected Ellen Wilkinson as its parliamentary candidate for the next general election. [...] Wilkinson had helped to found the British Communist Party in 1920, and had a firebrand reputation. She had been associated with Hannington and the NUWM in the early 1920s, but had left the Communist Party in 1923 and had served as Labour MP for Middlesbrough East between 1924 and 1931.|$|E

Between 14 August and 10 September, affiliated and registered supporters {{and members of the}} Labour Party in London voted for their preferred candidate. The winning candidate was Sadiq Khan, with 59% of the vote. He defeated: Diane Abbott, former Shadow Minister for Public Health, candidate for leader in 2010 and MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington; Tessa Jowell, former Olympics Minister and former MP for Dulwich and West Norwood; David Lammy, former Universities Minister and MP for Tottenham; Gareth Thomas, Shadow Foreign Office Minister, Chair of the Co-operative Party and MP for Harrow West; and [...] Christian Wolmar, journalist, author, and railway historian.|$|E
500|$|As the {{new century}} began, Shaw became {{increasingly}} disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus, although a nominated Fabian delegate, he {{did not attend the}} London conference at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street in February 1900, that created the Labour Representation Committee—precursor of the modern Labour Party. By 1903, when his term as <b>borough</b> <b>councillor</b> expired, he had lost his earlier enthusiasm, writing: [...] "After six years of Borough Councilling I am convinced that the borough councils should be abolished". Nevertheless, in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections. After an eccentric campaign, which Holroyd characterises as [...] " [...] absolutely certain of not getting in", he was duly defeated. It was Shaw's final foray into electoral politics. Nationally, the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and saw the Labour members as inconsequential: [...] "I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body".|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{national}} campaigns, Lansbury remained a Poplar <b>borough</b> <b>councillor</b> and [...] Poor Law guardian, and between 1910 and 1913 served [...] a three-year term as a London County Councillor. In 1919 {{he became the}} first Labour mayor of Poplar. [...] Under the then-existing financial system for local government, boroughs were individually responsible [...] for poor relief within their boundaries. This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar, where rates revenues were low and [...] poverty and unemployment, always severe, were exacerbated in times of economic recession. Under this system, Postgate argues, [...] "The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility, as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council". In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations, the council was required to levy precepts [...] to pay for [...] services provided by [...] bodies such as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Police. [...] Lansbury had long argued that a degree [...] of rates equalisation across London was necessary, to share [...] costs more fairly.|$|E
