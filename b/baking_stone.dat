5000|$|To prevent {{fracturing}} of {{the stone}} by thermal shock, some bakers place the <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> in a cold oven and heat it over at least 45 minutes, then allow it to cool down slowly inside the oven after switching it off. Because {{of the possibility of}} rapid temperature change, baking stones should not be left in an oven while it is in self cleaning mode. Some cooks recommend sprinkling corn meal, semolina, bread crumbs or rice flour on the <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> to prevent the crust from sticking. [...] Because it is porous, a <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> will absorb any fluid which it comes into contact with, including detergent. They should be cleaned with a dry brush and then plain water.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> is a {{portable}} cooking surface used in baking. They {{may be made}} of ceramic, stone, or more recently, salt. [...] Food is put on the <b>baking</b> <b>stone,</b> which is then placed in the oven, though sometimes the stone is heated first. Baking stones are used much like cookie sheets, but may absorb additional moisture for crispier food. Due to the thermal mass of baking stones and the material's property as a poor heat conductor, food {{is less likely to}} burn when using a <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> than when using metal or glass bakeware. Baking stones are a variation on hot stone cooking {{which is one of the}} oldest cooking techniques known. Baking [...] "stones" [...] may be purchased as unglazed ceramic tiles, unglazed fired clay tiles and quarried tiles, very cheaply from tile shops and hardware stores.|$|E
50|$|Blocks of salt {{are also}} used as serving dishes, <b>baking</b> <b>stones,</b> and griddles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{red rock}} of the mesa is Entrada Sandstone, with white bands. The {{top layer of}} rock is Dakota Sandstone. The mesa's white Zuni Sandstone {{is the source of}} flat <b>baking</b> <b>stones</b> for [...] "hewe", a paper-thin cornbread {{prepared}} for special occasions. Springs around the mesa are a traditional source of water.|$|R
50|$|From the 1960s Javier Cabrera Darquea {{collected}} and popularized the stones, obtaining {{many of them}} from a farmer named Basilio Uschuya. Uschuya, after claiming them to be real ancient artifacts, admitted to creating the carvings he had sold and said he produced a patina by <b>baking</b> the <b>stone</b> in cow dung.|$|R

50|$|Ovens have a {{recovery}} time after being opened. Opening an oven door {{can reduce the}} temperature within an oven by up to 50° F (30° C). Methods to reduce oven recovery time include the placement of a <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> or pizza stone, tiles made of ceramic, or a brick insert device in an oven, all of which serve to reduce recovery time through their heat retention properties.|$|E
5000|$|When {{designed}} for cooking pizzas, a <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> {{is often referred}} to as a pizza stone. Using a pizza stone more or less mimicks the effects of cooking a pizza in a masonry oven. The porous nature of the stone used also helps absorb moisture, resulting in a crispy crust. Small pizza stones can be purchased to fit in any conventional cooking oven or an enclosed barbecue-style grill. High-end ovens sometimes offer optional pizza stones that are specifically {{designed for}} each oven model and may include a specialized heating element. In addition to traditional methods, a Pizza stone can also be made out of metal.|$|E
50|$|Grimm Adventure Forest (Gurimu Boken no Mori) is a themed {{campground}} {{based on}} Grimm's Fairy Tales. It offers cottage and tent camping. There are many extra activities for children such as <b>baking</b> with a <b>stone</b> oven and dying fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The Brothaus or bakery from 1985 is {{a replica}} of a bakehouse (Backhaus) on a {{traditional}} farm near Gifhorn. Here bread and cakes based on traditional recipes are baked in two, wood-fired, <b>stone,</b> <b>baking</b> ovens and sold to the museum's visitors.|$|R
5000|$|Padraic, Mona, and Noaille are cinders of {{scorched}} <b>stone,</b> <b>baking</b> in the austere {{glare of}} the Great White Star. Tidally locked Noaille is notable for its rains of liquid mercury which fall on the dark side and flow to the hot side where they vaporize, to return once again to the dark side.|$|R
50|$|Historically {{a part of}} the Blackburn Hundred {{the first}} record of Baxenden appears in 1194 as the site of a vaccary subject to Kirkstall Abbey. In the records Baxenden appears under the name Bastanedenecloch likely meaning valley where baking stones are found from the Old English bæc-stan meaning <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> denu meaning valley (see dale) and clōh meaning ravine (in Northern Middle English clōh evolved into cloghe which has survived in a number of local place names as clough). By 1305 in the records of the de Lacy family the name of Baxenden had evolved to Bakestonden where records show 12s 2d were spent {{transporting}} seven loads of lead from Baxenden to Bradford. By 1494 the name had evolved to Baxtonden.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the rise}} time of most sourdough {{starters}} {{is longer than}} that of breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable {{for use in a}} bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin.|$|E
5000|$|Blue corn, {{a staple}} {{grain of the}} Hopi, is first reduced to a fine powder on a metate. It is then mixed with water and burnt ashes of native bushes or juniper trees for {{purposes}} of nixtamalization (nutritional modification of corn by means of lime or other alkali). The thin batter is then smeared by hand over a large flat <b>baking</b> <b>stone</b> that has been heated over a fire and coated with oil made from pounded seeds of the native American plants squash and sunflower, and also from the seeds of watermelon, which though originally from Africa, {{has been in the}} Americas for at least 500 years. [...] Piki bread bakes almost instantaneously and is peeled from the rock in sheets so thin they are translucent. Several sheets of the bread are often rolled up loosely into flattened scrolls.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Erich von Däniken, Uschuya stated he had faked the stones that he had sold. [...] In 1975 Uschuya and another farmer named Irma Gutierrez de Aparcana confirmed that they had forged the stones they gave to Cabrera by copying the images from comic books, text books and magazines. [...] Later, Uschuya recanted the forging story {{during an interview}} with a German journalist, saying that he had claimed they were a hoax to avoid imprisonment for selling archaeological artifacts. In 1977, during the BBC documentary Pathway to the Gods, Uschuya produced an Ica stone with a dentist's drill and claimed to have produced a fake patina by <b>baking</b> the <b>stone</b> in cow dung. [...] That same year, another BBC documentary was released with a skeptical analysis of Cabrera's stones, and the new-found attention to the phenomenon prompted Peruvian authorities to arrest Uschuya, as Peruvian law prohibits the sale of archaeological discoveries. Uschuya recanted his claim that he had found them and instead admitted they were hoaxes, saying [...] "Making these stones is easier than farming the land." [...] He engraved the stones using images in books and magazines as examples and knives, chisels and a dental drill. He also said that he had not made all the stones. He was not punished, and continued to sell similar stones to tourists as trinkets. [...] The stones continued to be made and carved by other artists as forgeries of the original forgeries.|$|R
