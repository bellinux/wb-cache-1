Methods and Results: We studied 18 pigs subjected to right atrial appendage rapid pacing at 500 beats/min for 3 hours that were randomly assigned to the absence or presence of <b>bepridil</b> administration for 14 days. They were divided into 2 groups, an atrial pacing only group (PG; n = 10) and an atrial pacing plus <b>bepridil</b> group (PBG; n = 8).

Like <b>bepridil,</b> both TFP and W 7 reduced the severity of arrhythmias evoked by 30 min of coronary artery occlusion in the anaesthetized rat. TFP (2. 5 - 10 mg kg- 1, i. v.), W 7 (2. 5 - 10 mg kg- 1, i. v.) and <b>bepridil</b> (1 - 5 mg kg- 1, i. v.) also antagonized the development of ventricular fibrillation induced by 5 min of occlusion followed by reperfusion. All three drugs also reduced mortality. TFP and <b>bepridil</b> also reduced the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular tachycardia whilst all 3 drugs reduced its duration. Although TFP was shown to possess alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties, the classical alpha-blocker, phentolamine, failed to reduce significantly the incidence or severity of reperfusion arrhythmias. In contrast to <b>bepridil</b> (2 - 20 microM), which markedly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) of guinea-pig isolated papillary muscle, W 7 (5 - 50 microM) showed only weak effects on Vmax and was at least 10 times less potent than <b>bepridil</b> whilst TFP only reduced Vmax in high concentrations (40 - 100 microM) which lowered resting membrane potential. Unlike <b>bepridil,</b> neither TFP (4 - 40 microM) nor W 7 prolonged the absolute refractory period. The results suggest that drugs which inhibit calmodulin confer protection against both ischaemia-and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in the rat.

Methods and resultsIn 119 patients with non-valvular AF lasting > 6 months who failed to maintain sinus rhythm after medical cardioversion without <b>bepridil</b> or electrical cardioversion, we prescribed <b>bepridil.</b> We divided our patients into success group who maintained sinus rhythm for at least 6 months using <b>bepridil</b> and failure group, and compared the following parameters, which were measured just before prescription of <b>bepridil,</b> between the two groups: hs-CRP as a marker of inflammation, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, ejection fraction, and left atrial dimension as echocardiographic markers, and the incidence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. After the treatment with <b>bepridil,</b> 57 patients converted to sinus rhythm; however, 12 patients among these 57 patients could not maintain sinus rhythm. Therefore, the success group consisted of 45 patients (38 %). Univariate analysis revealed that left atrial dimension and the value of hs-CRP were significantly lower and ejection fraction was significantly higher in the success group than the failure group. Multivariate analysis showed that hs-CRP and left atrial dimension were independent factors for AF recurrence. ConclusionsBepridil is effective in restoring sinus rhythm for refractory AF patients. Inflammation, in addition to left atrial dimension, may be associated with successful cardioversion using <b>bepridil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Antiarrhythmic agents {{may affect}} {{electrical}} remodeling but {{little is known}} regarding clinical cases. We evaluated fibrillation cycle length (FCL) of atrial fibrillation (AF) by spectral analysis of fibrillation waves (FW) in surface ECG for patients on antiarrhythmic agents. Methods and Results: 18 patients (14 males; 58 ± 2 year-old) with paroxysmal AF (pAF) lasting over 30 minutes recorded by Holter ECG were enrolled. FW was purified by subtraction of QRS-T, and calculated by fast Fourier transformation analysis. FCL was defined as reciprocal of mean peak frequency. Temporal variability was expressed as FCL coefficient of variation (FCL-CV). FCL and FCL-CV were calculated at 0, 1, 5, 10, and 30 minutes after the onset of AF. We evaluated three groups: control group (6 patients with no medication), class I group (6 patients with pilsicainide or flecainide), and <b>bepridil</b> group (6 patients with <b>bepridil).</b> FCL showed quick-shortening at first minute in control group (p < 0. 001), and relatively slow-shortening in class I group. In <b>bepridil</b> group, FCL was not significantly shortened within 30 minutes. FCL-CV did not change, but was significantly larger in <b>bepridil</b> group. Conclusions: FCL of pAF showed significant shortening in control group, but FCL shortening was suppressed and FCL-CV was larger in <b>bepridil</b> group. This result may indicate the specific effect of <b>bepridil</b> for electrical changes in early phase of pAF...|$|E
40|$|The Ca 2 +-sensor protein {{troponin}} C (TnC) exerts a {{key role}} in the regulation of muscle contraction, and constitutes a target for Ca 2 + sensitizer compounds, such as <b>bepridil,</b> known to increase its apparent Ca 2 + affinity. Moreover, <b>bepridil</b> has been reported to exert a differential effect in slow and fast skeletal muscle fibres, which express the slow/cardiac and fast TnC isoform, respectively. The role of the TnC isoform in establishing the differential effect of <b>bepridil</b> was assessed in slow soleus and fast tibialis rat skinned fibres, by extraction of endogenous TnC and consecutive reconstitution with either slow or fast recombinant TnC. A mutant (VG 2), lacking the regulatory site II, was also used to distinguish the role of each regulatory site. Fast tibialis fibres reconstituted with cardiac TnC exhibited a typical slow <b>bepridil</b> reactivity, while slow soleus fibres reincorporated with fast TnC displayed a typically fast reactivity to <b>bepridil.</b> These results indicated that the differential effect of <b>bepridil</b> in slow and fast fibres is related to the TnC isoform predominantly expressed in a fibre. Experiments with the VG 2 mutant demonstrated that BPD can achieve an increase in the Ca 2 + affinity in the absence of a functional site II. Thus, site I was necessary for the BPD effect to be independent of the Ca 2 + concentration. Moreover, the amplitude of the reinforcement in the Ca 2 + affinity, induced by the binding of <b>bepridil</b> to the TnC molecule, is dependent on the number of functional regulatory sites, the larger affinity reinforcement being detected when only one regulatory site (either site I or II) is functional...|$|E
40|$|A {{randomised}} double-blind parallel group {{study was}} performed to compare the clinical efficacy of <b>bepridil,</b> a new calcium slow channel blocker, with that of propranolol and placebo in patients with chronic stable angina of effort. Efficacy was assessed objectively by dynamic exercise testing using an upright bicycle ergometer and subjectively by patient documentation of anginal frequency and nitrate consumption. The administration of <b>bepridil</b> resulted in a significant improvement in physical work capacity expressed as calculated maximal oxygen uptake (Vo 2 max) and exercise time. This was associated with subjective improvement in terms of reduced anginal frequency. Despite baseline differences in exercise performance and anginal frequency between the three treatment groups, the beneficial effects of <b>bepridil</b> were statistically significant when compared to propranolol. Although minor electrocardiographic changes were noted, no adverse effects were evident when <b>bepridil</b> was prescribed in doses of up to 400 mg/day over a 10 week period...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} intravenously administered <b>bepridil,</b> a new anti-anginal drug with slow calcium current blocking properties, were studied in 20 patients undergoing an endocavitary cardiac exploration for various reasons. Classical techniques of programmed electrical stimulation were used. <b>Bepridil</b> markedly increased the refractory {{period of the}} atrium, atrioventricular node and the AH- interval. The effects on HR and ventricular refractory period were minimal, and sinus rate decreased slightly. A pronounced reduction in the heart {{rate at which the}} Wenckebach phenomenon was obtained in the anterograde direction (16 %) and particularly in the retrograde direction (26 %) was observed. During this study the drug appeared beneficial in suppressing atrial flutter, atrial extrasystoles, and ven-tricular extrasystoles. In two patients with intranodal reciprocal rhythm, the injection of <b>bepridil</b> terminated the tachycardia which could not be reinitiated later. No side-effects occurred and it appears that bundle branch block and prolonged HV interval are not contraindications to the use of <b>bepridil...</b>|$|E
