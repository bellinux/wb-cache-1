2500|$|... 86 x Style Cb Spider (model ZN6-A2B8) is a Toyota {{convertible}} by Toyota Original Accessory, with 6-speed automatic transmission, fender {{garnish with}} side lamp, trunk spoiler and licence garnish, rear combination lamp (in dark smoke plated), <b>backup</b> <b>lamp</b> rear bumper, spider aero bulge, rear diffuser integrated into rear bumper, one-off style Cb sport seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, style Cb original meter panel/new decorative panel with lighting, style Cb original floor mat, brembo brake with front 4-piston and rear 2-piston calipers, Goodyear Eagle LS Premium tires (215/40R18 89W front, 225/45R18 91W rear) ...|$|E
50|$|On the outside, the SE30 {{differed}} from other Diablo models with a revised front fascia featuring straked brake cooling ducts and a deeper spoiler, while the rear cooling ducts were {{changed to a}} vertical body-colored design. The raging bull emblem was moved {{from the front of}} the luggage lid to the nose panel of the car between the front indicators. The engine lid had slats covering the narrow rear window, while a larger spoiler was installed as standard equipment. The single rear fog lamp and rear <b>backup</b> <b>lamp,</b> which had been on either side of the rear grille, were moved into the bumper; this change would be applied to all Diablo models across the lineup. Completing the exterior variations were special magnesium alloy wheels, SE30 badging, and a new metallic purple paint color (this could be changed upon request).|$|E
50|$|The {{composite}} sitting/sleeping car, VAM1, {{was built}} with 10 evenly-spaced windows per side, plus a closer window and a {{door at the}} No.2 end. Access to the car was via the doors at the No.2 end, or via coupled carriages and the diaphragms linking them to VAM1. The ten windows each represented a single compartment. The first and second compartments at the No.1 end were fitted with bench seats for four people each, while the other eight compartments were fitted with three-person seats divisible with retractable armrests. All seats could fold down to form a bed, and above that was a second bed, giving capacity for up to 20 sleeping passengers or up to 24 first-class and 8 second-class passengers. Generally speaking only the first four compartments at the No.1 end were used for sitting passengers, and the remaining six were used exclusively for sleeping passengers. Partially because of this, the public address system was only wired to the four compartments at the No.1 end, {{and not the other}} six. Each compartment also had its own cupboard, shower, toilet, card table and wardrobe. The interior was sheathed with laminex panels.At the No.2 end a small curtained-off area was reserved for the carriage conductor, with a seat to work at. Weight of the car was 51 tons 13 cwt. Water capacity was 280 gallons of cold water, plus 75 gallons of hot water for the showers. The car was fitted with marker lights, <b>backup</b> <b>lamp</b> brackets and tail discs at both ends, allowing it to trail any train. Notably, even though the car would only normally trail trains in New South Wales, the end-of-train marker was a Victorian Railways disc rather than a New South Wales Railways triangle.|$|E
50|$|Effective in 1966, US-market {{passenger}} cars {{were required to}} be equipped with padded instrument panels, front and rear outboard lap belts, and white reverse (<b>backup)</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Accessories: this {{includes}} cigarette lighter outlet, radio/CD player, ignition switch, cabin fan and heater, speedometer, horn, turn signals, automotive lighting (headlamps, taillamps and <b>backup</b> <b>lamps),</b> door switch, seat belt, brake alarms, power windows and windshield wiper.|$|R
5000|$|Thus the D43-3 Dodge Mayfair was {{introduced}} in both hardtop and sedan models. [...] (Contrary to published articles, the D43-3 series was not a wagon). The exterior had the front fender trim extend onto {{the front door and}} <b>backup</b> <b>lamps</b> were standard. Interiors were two-tone, in either blue or green, with a matching steering wheel. [...] With the new D43-3 Mayfair, the Regent Mayfair hardtop was dropped.|$|R
50|$|The Flight Hawk was {{a product}} of a Raymond Loewy design. It was based on the Champion two-door coupe that was {{introduced}} for the 1953 model year. Like the other 1956 Hawks, the Flight Hawk received a new hood, grille, deck lid, and instrument panel. Flight Hawks otherwise had the minimum amount of exterior chrome. Things like oil filter, <b>backup</b> <b>lamps,</b> radio, clock, windshield washers, outside mirrors, heater, and full hubcaps were available from the factory or could be added through the dealer.|$|R
50|$|Studebaker's {{executives}} allowed Stevens {{to continue}} the process of modernizing main line vehicles {{that resulted in a}} more extensive (but still inexpensive) restyling for 1964. What resulted was the most mainstream looking Studebakers since 1946. The Mercedes-like grille of 1962-63 gave way to a full-width, stamped aluminum grille and squared-off headlamp surrounds. Stevens flattened the hood, roofline and trunklid, and reworked the tail panel to incorporate new horizontal taillamps and <b>backup</b> <b>lamps,</b> all the while ingeniously retaining the sculpted quarter panels introduced in 1962, which still suited the new look and reduced by a considerable amount the cost of tooling.|$|R
5000|$|The Speedster's {{list price}} started at $3,346, or about $800 {{more than a}} base 1955 President State hardtop. The reason was the 1955 President Speedster was loaded with {{standard}} equipment including: choice of Studebaker Automatic Drive or overdrive transmissions, power steering, power brakes, four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust, [...] "Shoemaker-stitched" [...] diamond-quilted genuine top-grain leather seating, carpeting front and rear, a map pocket (but no glove box) an eight-tube push-button radio, an engine-turned dashboard with a Stewart-Warner 160 mph speedometer and an 8,000 rpm tachometer, turn signals, electric clock, tinted glass, cigarette lighter, oil filter and oil bath air cleaner, dual <b>backup</b> <b>lamps,</b> triple horns, two-speed electric wipers, tubeless whitewall tires, simulated wire wheel covers and fog-light bumperettes.|$|R
2500|$|Fender and hood {{stampings}} {{were similar}} to the 1960-'61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat's-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim {{was applied to the}} tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for optional <b>backup</b> <b>lamps,</b> which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter [...] "VALIANT" [...] callout on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field callouts were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylized-V Valiant logo.|$|R
2500|$|Carpathias lower decks were well-ventilated {{by means}} of deck ventilators, {{supplemented}} by electric fans. The ventilation systems were designed to force fresh air over coiled thermotanks, which could be fed with cool water during the summer or steam during the winter, thus heating and cooling the ship as conditions warranted. [...] Although the ship was fully electrified with over 2,000 lamps, the ship still had <b>backup</b> oil <b>lamps</b> in the cabins when she entered service.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 {{was a year}} {{of major}} change. The most {{noticeable}} of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted {{and were able to}} accommodate <b>backup</b> <b>lamps,</b> which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with ECE regulations rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of [...] A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below , which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires. A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid. For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by 78 mm.|$|R
50|$|The Diablo GT was noticeably {{different}} on the exterior. While previous Diablo models had differed one from another with subtle fascia refinements or {{changes in the}} brake cooling ducts, the Diablo GT opted for an all new black carbon fiber front air dam with large brake ducts and a central vent for the oil cooler (the car still featured driving lamps, the single pair of round units featured on the Diablo VT Roadster). In the front luggage compartment lid, a large air extractor was added, while the small corner vents on the front fenders were changed to NACA style ducts. The fenders themselves were widened to accommodate a wider front track. In the rear, the bumper and its lamps were removed entirely, replaced by a carbon fiber diffuser that forced the fog and <b>backup</b> <b>lamps</b> into the outer pair of tail lamps, and shielded a pair of large center-mounted exhaust pipes. The engine lid featured a large central ram air duct protruding above the roof; a rear spoiler was standard equipment. This radical new body was composed mostly of carbon fiber, with the steel roof and aluminum doors being the only components to retain their standard material. Special 3-piece OZ wheels finished the GT's exterior package.|$|R
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the backup lights were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their <b>backup</b> <b>lamps</b> {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamic field}} {{experiment}} was conducted, both {{during the day}} and at night, {{to examine the effects of}} rear-window transmittance and backup-lamp intensity on driver backing behavior (stopping distance, velocity, acceleration, and trial duration) toward a known stationary object. In addition, three years of crash data from the General Estimates System (GES) file were examined for backing crashes. Specific variables of interest in the GES data were driver age, ambient light condition, and the type of passenger vehicle involved (car versus minivan or sport utility vehicle). The results of the field experiment indicate that drivers do not adjust their backing behavior to variations in the amount of available light, at least under conditions where there is little uncertainty regarding obstacles. However, drivers do appear to adjust their backing behavior as they grow older, for the most part driving more cautiously. Nevertheless, the crash data indicate that older drivers are still over-represented in backing crashes. Minivans and sport utility vehicles, which are much more likely to have rear-window tinting, are also over-represented in backing crashes. Based on the crash data, despite the findings of the field experiment, it is suggested that older drivers might benefit from higher-transmittance windows, higher-intensity <b>backup</b> <b>lamps,</b> and rearward detection and warning devices. These same modifications might also benefit the drivers of minivans and sport utility vehicles...|$|R
5000|$|During the {{management}} of civil engineer Gaudêncio Fontana (1843), the lighthouse was updated with a new rotation platform, comprising sixteen Argand lamps with parabolic reflectors. Yet, by 1865, there were critics of the system, noting the inefficiency of the lighthouse. Over time this was addressed by the installation of a blow-horn signal and the renovation to electric-powered machines. The [...] "electrical" [...] lighthouse began functioning in 1897, with a system that included a <b>backup</b> petroleum <b>lamp.</b> The main unit was a fourth-order optical system, with rotational platform and clock mechanism, and was paired with a steam siren.|$|R
5000|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel.

50|$|If {{power is}} interrupted, even briefly, the lamp's arc will extinguish, {{and the high}} {{pressure}} {{that exists in the}} hot arc tube will prevent restriking the arc; with a normal ignitor a cool-down period of 5-10 minutes will be required before the lamp can be restarted, but with special ignitors and specially designed lamps, the arc can be immediately re-established. On fixtures without instant restrike capability, a momentary loss of power can mean no light for several minutes. For safety reasons, many metal-halide fixtures have a <b>backup</b> tungsten-halogen incandescent <b>lamp</b> that operates during cool-down and restrike. Once the metal halide restrikes and warms up, the incandescent safety light is switched off. A warm lamp also tends to take more time to reach its full brightness than a lamp that is started completely cold.|$|R
50|$|For 2010, the Sentra {{received}} a mid-cycle refresh. It revisions included a new, Altima-inspired grille, a revised lower fascia and slightly different headlights. In back, new taillights (though {{almost identical to}} previous years) and additional chrome trim pieces on the trunk and side moldings highlight the major changes. New trimlines are offered to balance out the prices. Inside is a new red back-lighting color for the speedometer and knobs, and a new CD player with an optional navigation system. The new audio system includes iPod and USB integration on certain models, {{as well as a}} <b>backup</b> camera. Fog <b>lamps</b> are no longer standard on the 2.0S and SL model and leather seats are now only available as an option rather than standard on the SL model for 2010, which is reflected in the new, lower MSRP. The Brazilian export variant features a flexible fuel engine and retractable side mirrors were adopted from the Nissan Versa.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} from the SMOV IR FSM (Filter Select Mecha-nism) and internal lamp check proposals, programs designed to verify the operability of the IR filter wheel {{and the health of}} the primary and <b>backup</b> IR internal <b>lamps.</b> A tungsten flatfield was taken in each filter of the wheel, excluding the grisms. The wheel performed as expected and all data were successfully acquired. The resulting flatfield features, e. g the scratches, areas of lower QE, bad and unresponsive pixels, were similar to those seen in ground testing. However, some flatfields (F 098 M, F 130 N, F 132 N, and F 167 N) showed what appear to be glints and reflections at the few percent level or less, possibly caused by a light leak around the diffuser paddle used to acquire the internal flatfields. The output flux of both lamps is 6 - 10 % higher than it was on the ground, likely due to the lamps run-ning hotter in the space environment than they did in the thermal vacuum test chamber. The relative output of the primary to spare lamp is {{the same as it was}} on the ground, to within 1 - 2 %. On a more general note, the behavior of the early reads in the IR multiaccum files could benefit from a closer investigation: there appears to be a significant non-lin...|$|R
