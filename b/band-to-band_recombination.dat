Excess carrier {{dynamics}} in 6 H-SiC substrates with {{n- and p-type doping}} were detected using femtosecond pump-probe measurements with supercontinuum probing. <b>Band-to-band</b> <b>recombination</b> and carrier trapping were determined {{as the main}} recombination processes in both materials. Spectral fingerprints corresponding to each of these recombination components were obtained using the global and target analysis.

The optical gap of the p, i, and n layers were 2. 0, 2. 25, and 1. 7 eV, respectively. The reverse current producing the radiative emission is mainly due to a field-enhanced thermal injection mechanism. At low-current densities the total light emitted {{is proportional to the}} fifth power of the injected current. At higher injections, however, it becomes quadratic.

The measurements are performed using laser light excitation with wavelengths ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 5 mu m to reduce inhomogeneity effects in the extraction of the Auger recombination parameters. A linear approximation of the initial excess carrier decay lifetime yields an approximate value of the Auger recombination coefficient in Ge gamma(A,Ge) congruent to 2 x 10 (- 31) cm(6) /s, which is close to that in Si. These characteristics also indicate that the difference in Auger recombination coefficients for the ehh and eeh processes is small.

Photoluminescence (PL) imaging of the <b>band-to-band</b> radiative <b>recombination</b> is used to characterize silicon quality and defects regions within the brick. PL images of the brick surfaces are compared to minority-carrier lifetimes measured by resonant-coupled photoconductive decay (RCPCD). Photoluminescence images on silicon bricks can be correlated to lifetime measured by photoconductive decay and could be used for high-resolution characterization of material before wafers are cut. The RCPCD technique has shown the longest lifetimes of any of the lifetime measurement techniques we have applied to the bricks. RCPCD benefits from the low-frequency and long-excitation wavelengths used. In addition, RCPCD is a transient technique that directly monitors the decay rate of photoconductivity and does not rely on models or calculations for lifetime. The measured lifetimes over brick surfaces have shown strong correlations to the PL image intensities; therefore, this correlation could then be used to transform the PL image into a high-resolution lifetime map...|$|R

Here, we show how to correctly reproduce this experimental data by including an exponential tail of localized states into the density of states for both electrons and holes, and allowing recombination to occur between free charge carriers and charge carriers trapped in these states. When this recombination via tail states is included, the dependence of charge-carrier concentration on voltage is distinctly different from the case of <b>band-to-band</b> <b>recombination</b> and the dependence of recombination current on carrier concentration to a power higher than 2 can be explained...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} {{photovoltaic conversion efficiency}} of highly effective silicon solar cells (SC) has been performed for n-type and p-type bases. Considered here is the case when the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination in the silicon bulk {{is determined by the}} deep level of Fe. It has shown that, due to asymmetry of recombination parameters inherent to this level, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency is increased in SC with the n-type base and decreased in SC with the p-type base with the increase in doping.

40|$|In {{traditional}} <b>band-to-band</b> Auger <b>recombination</b> theory, the low-injection carrier lifetime is {{an inverse}} quadratic {{function of the}} doping density. However, for doping densities below about 3 E 18 cm^- 3, the low-injection Auger lifetimes measured in the past on silicon were significantly smaller than predicted by this theory. Recently, a new theory has been developed [A. Hangleiter and R. H¿cker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 215 (1990) ] which attributes these deviations to Coulombic interactions between mobile charge carriers. This theory has been supported experimentally to {{a high degree of}} accuracy in n-type silicon, however, no satisfactory support has been found in p-type silicon for doping densities below 3 E 17 cm^- 3. In this work, we investigate the most recent lifetime measurements of crystalline silicon and support experimentally the Coulomb-enhanced Auger theory in p-type silicon in the doping range down to 1 E 16 cm^- 3. Based on the experimental data, we present an empirical parameterisation of the low-injection Auger lifetime. This parameterisation is valid in n- and p-type silicon with arbitrary doping concentrations and for temperatures between 70 and 400 K. We implement this parameterisation into a numerical device simulator to demonstrate how the new Auger limit influences the open-circuit voltage capability of silicon solar cells.

Although many progresses have been made for silicon-based light emitter in recent years [1 – 4], it is still a big challenge to overcome the inefficient <b>band-to-band</b> radiative <b>recombination</b> of silicon. With large band offset and strong quantum confinement, the self-assembled QDs are promising structure to enhance the optical characteristics [5]. In the past two decades, the self-assembled Ge QDs on Si substrates, which are compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor processes, have been widely studied for Si-based optoelectronic device applications [6, 7]. Unfortunately, the Ge QDs on Si can only provide a good confinement for the holes, which is hard to capture the electrons. Lacking of electrons for radiative recombination in Ge QDs limits its emission efficiency. A lot of efforts had been made to investigate luminescence of Ge QDs/Si(001) multilayer structure [8 – 10]. However, the radiative recombination in Ge QDs is still weak, even observed at low temperature [8, 9, 11]. How to increase the radiative recombination of Ge QDs is still a problem. Usually, carrier collection is a size-dependent behavior [12]. Therefore, increasing Ge QDs’ probability of capturing the electrons by increasing Ge QDs’ size is a feasible way to improve the Ge QDs’ emission performance. However, many studies concentrated on lower temperature grown small-size Ge QDs [6, 13], which have stronger quantum confinement and lower Si-Ge interdiffusion.|$|R
