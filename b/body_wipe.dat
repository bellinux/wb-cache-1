40|$|Children {{generally}} have higher Flame Retardant (FR) concentrations in serum {{compared to other}} age groups. Toddler behavior enhances direct contact with house dust since their frequent presence proximate to the floor, and their mouthing behavior. This study aimed to thoroughly investigate FR levels in <b>body</b> <b>wipes</b> of toddlers 8 – 18 months old) and in indoor dust using a noninvasive sampling technique. In this cross-sectional study, <b>body</b> <b>wipes</b> from hands, mouth and back, and indoor household dust samples were collected in twenty-one families and analyzed for one brominated- and seven organophosphorus FRs (polybrominated diphenyl ether 209 (BDE 209), tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), tris(phenyl) phosphate (TPHP), tris(methylphenyl) phosphate (TMPP), resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate)). Accelerated solvent extraction was used for extraction and the extract was measured with liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Non-parametric correlation analyses were performed to assess associations. All FRs were detected in body- and indoor dust samples (median range: 1. 0 ng/hand wipe (BDE 209) to 65 ng/hand wipe (TCIPP)) and were mostly correlated with each other. We estimated that approximately 260 mg dust (range 50 – 880 mg) accumulated on toddler's hands per day. Hand-to-mouth frequency was negatively associated with FR levels in wipes (τ = − 0. 38, p = 0. 04). With increasing age FR concentrations (BDE 209, TCEP, TDCIPP, TPHP and TMPP) on hands decreased significantly (p = 0. 01 – 0. 03). Girls had significantly less FRs (TCEP, TCIPP, TPHP and TMPP) on the hands (p = 0. 01 – 0. 03) than boys. This is {{to the best of}} the authors’ knowledge the first study in Europe that measured brominated- as well as organophosphorus FRs in several types of <b>body</b> <b>wipes</b> from toddlers and that estimated the amount of house dust that accumulates on toddler's hands...|$|R
40|$|Protocols for the {{screening}} and decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus prior to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have become widely adopted. The goals {{of this study}} were to determine: (1) whether implementation of a screening protocol followed by decolonization with mupirocin/vancomycin and chlorhexidine reduces the risk of revision compared with no screening protocol (i. e., chlorhexidine alone) and (2) whether clinical criteria could reliably predict colonization with MSSA and/or MRSA. Electronic medical records of primary patients undergoing TJA that were screened (n= 3, 927) and were not screened (n= 1, 751) for Staphylococcus aureus at least 4 days prior to surgery, respectively, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received chlorhexidine <b>body</b> <b>wipes</b> preoperatively. Patients carrying MSSA and MRSA were treated preoperatively with mupirocin and vancomycin, respectively, along with the standard preoperative antibiotics and chlorhexidine <b>body</b> <b>wipes.</b> Screened patients were 50 % less likely to require revision due to prosthetic joint infection compared to those not screened (p= 0. 04). Multivariate regression models were poorly accurate in predicting colonization with MSSA (AUC = 0. 58) and MRSA (AUC = 0. 62).

Efforts should be made to improve wrestler hygiene practices, to utilize recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, and to handle blood and other bodily fluids appropriately. Suggested measures include: promotion of hand hygiene practices; educating athletes not to pick, squeeze, or scratch skin lesions; encouraging athletes to shower after activity; educating athletes not to share protective gear, towels, razors or water bottles; ensuring recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection of wrestling mats, all athletic equipment, locker rooms, and whirlpool tubs are closely followed; and verifying clean up of blood and other potentially infectious materials." [...] More ways of prevention include wearing long sleeve shirts and sweatpants to limitthe amount of skin to skin contact. A wrestler should also not share theirequipment with other teammates and should regularly check their skin for any lesions or other signs of outbreaks. <b>Body</b> <b>wipes</b> are also common to see Coaches must also enforce the disinfecting and sanitary cleansing of the wrestling mats and other practice areas.

40|$|Background: Skin {{exposure}} to isocyanates, {{in addition to}} respiratory exposures,may contribute to sen-sitization and asthma. Quantitative skin exposure data are scarce and quantitative methods limited. Methods: As part of the Survey of Painters and Repairers of Autobodies by Yale study, a method to sample and quantify human isocyanate skin exposure was developed (based on NIOSH 5525 method) and used to evaluate aliphatic isocyanate skin exposure in 81 auto body shop painters and <b>body</b> technicians. <b>Wipe</b> samples were collected from unprotected skin and from under PPE (gloves, clothing and respirator) using a polypropylene glycol-impregnated wipe. Hexam-ethylene diisocyanate (HDI), its polyisocyanates [HDI-derived polyisocyanates (pHDI) ], isophor-one diisocyanate (IPDI) and its polyisocyanates and IPDI-derived polyisocyanates (pIPDI) were quantified separately and also expressed as the total free isocyanate groups (total NCO). Results: For unprotected skin areas, 49 samples were collected for spray painting, 13 for mixing, 27 for paint-related tasks (e. g. sanding and compounding) and 53 for non-paint-related tasks.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of {{chemicals in the}} environment is ubiquitous. Human biomonitoring {{studies have shown that}} various chemicals can be detected in the majority of the population, including pregnant women. These compounds may pass the placenta, and reach the fetus. This early life exposure in particular may be detrimental as some chemicals may disrupt the endocrine system, which is involved in various processes during development. The LINC study is a prospective birth cohort designed to study associations between early life environmental exposures and child health, including growth and neurodevelopment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to give an overview of this cohort. Methods and design Recruitment for this cohort has started in 2011 in three Dutch areas and is still ongoing. To date over 300 mother-child pairs have been included. Women are preferably included during the first trimester of pregnancy. Major congenital anomalies and twin births are reasons for exclusion. To assess exposure to environmental chemicals, cord blood, placenta, meconium and vernix are collected. Parents collect urine of the child shortly after birth and breast milk in the second month of life. Exposure to a broad range of environmental chemicals are determined in cord plasma and breast milk. Furthermore various hormones, including leptin and cortisone, are determined in cord plasma, and in heel prick blood spots (thyroxine). Data on anthropometry of the child is collected through midwives and youth health care centres on various time points until the child is 18  months of age. Furthermore cognitive development is monitored by means of the van Wiechen scheme, and information on behavioral development is collected by means of the infant behavior questionnaire and the child behavior checklist. When the child is 12  months of age, a house visit is scheduled to assess various housing characteristics, as well as hand-to-mouth behavior of the child. At this visit exposure of the child to flame retardants (with endocrine disrupting properties) in house dust is determined by means of <b>body</b> <b>wipes.</b> They are furthermore also measured in a saliva sample of the child. Next to these measurements, women receive questionnaires each trimester regarding amongst others lifestyle of the parents, general health of the parents and the child, and mental state of the mother. Discussion This study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the VU University Medical Centre. Consent for the infant is given by the mother, who is specifically required to give consent for both herself as well as her child. Results will be published regardless of the findings of this study, and will be widely disseminated among related medical stakeholders (e. g. midwives and pediatricians), policy makers, and the general public...|$|R
50|$|Stardust the Super Wizard {{learned that}} the {{criminal}} scientist called the “Demon” had determined that the Earth's population {{was out of control}} and was planning to destroy every large city—starting with New York. The Demon had built an undersea pressure disturber that could generate a tidal surge large enough drown the entire city. Once the wave hit New York, he would use vibrating heat waves to trigger earthquakes. The Demon and his associate Max set out to sea on his yacht and activated his tidal device. A massive wave grew and began heading towards shore. Along its path, the wave smashed an ocean liner, killing all 2,000 of its passengers. Stardust flashed onto the Demon’s yacht and destroys the controls to the tidal device. Stardust then grabbed the Demon by the arm, whisked him away. Meanwhile, the people of New York City caught sight of the great wave and started panicking. Stardust flew across the ocean and dropped the Demon into the great wave. The crest of the wave crashed down and killed its creator. Stardust then used his disintegrating ray to destroy the Demon’s <b>body</b> and <b>wipe</b> him from existence. Stardust then halted the momentum of the tidal wave and gradually returned sea levels to normal. To calm the city, Stardust flew over New York displaying a message across the wake of his tubular spacial: “All danger passed. Tidal wave has disappeared.” The super wizard then rocketed back into space.|$|R
