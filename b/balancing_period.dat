30|$|The {{family of}} PROMETHEE methods were {{developed}} by Brans and Vincke (1985) to help a decision-maker rank partially (PROMETHEE I) or completely (PROMETHEE II) {{a finite number of}} options which are evaluated on a common set of non-commensurable multiple criteria (Mutikanga et al. 2011). PROMETHEE is an outranking method for a finite set of alternative actions to be ranked and selected among criteria which are often conflicting. PROMETHEE is also a quite simple ranking method in conception and application compared to the other methods for multi-criteria analysis (Brans et al. 1986). Alternatives are evaluated according to different criteria, which have to be maximized or minimized. Determination of the weights is an important step in most multi-criteria methods. It is assumed that the decision-maker is able to weigh the criteria appropriately, at least when the number of criteria is not too large (Macharis et al. 2004). For each criterion, the preference function translates the difference between the evaluations obtained by two alternatives into a preference degree ranging from zero to one.

Load imbalance presents itself {{as one of the}} significant challenges to achieving scalability and high performance. Manually handling the imbalance in dynamic applications and finding an optimum distribution of load becomes a herculean task. Charm++ provides the user with a run time system that can carry out dynamic load balancing. To enable Charm++ to carry out load balancing, the user takes certain decisions related to the load <b>balancing</b> <b>period</b> and strategy and informs these decision to the Charm++ run-time system.

40|$|Abstract—Performance of {{applications}} executed on large parallel systems suffer due to load imbalance. Load balancing {{is required to}} scale such applications to large systems. However, performing load balancing incurs a cost {{which may not be}} known a priori. In addition, application characteristics may change due to its dynamic nature and the parallel system used for execution. As a result, deciding when to balance the load to obtain the best performance is challenging. Existing approaches put this burden on the users, who rely on educated guess and extrapolation techniques to decide on a reasonable load <b>balancing</b> <b>period,</b> which may not be feasible and efficient. In this paper, we propose the Meta-Balancer framework which relieves the application programmers of deciding when to balance load. By continuously monitoring the application characteristics and using a set of guiding principles, Meta-Balancer invokes load balancing on its own without any prior application knowledge. We demonstrate that Meta-Balancer improves or matches the best performance that can be obtained by fine tuning periodic load balancing. We also show that in some cases Meta-Balancer improves performance by 18 % whereas periodic load balancing gives only a 1. 5 % benefit.

However, it is understood that both the definition and the surrounding energy supply system will affect significantly the way buildings are designed to achieve the ZEB goal. Since the energy system in Europe is expected to change significantly in the coming decades, especially for electricity, it is indispensable to tie the definition of ZEB to possible scenarios on such development of the energy system. A scenario is defined as a combination of options chosen within a framework of different uncertain futures. Two uncertainties are identified as most important for the development and deployment of ZEB: Technology development and Public attitude. These two uncertainties are used to span out a set of four relevant futures, also termed storylines, as a common background for scenario analysis. A formal definition of ZEB is characterized by a set of criteria that are: the system boundary, feeing-in possibilities, balance object, <b>balancing</b> <b>period,</b> credits, crediting method, energy performance and mismatch factors.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the value and}} cost of line-pack flexibility in liberalized gas markets through examination of the techno-economic characteristics of gas transport pipelines and the trade-offs between different ways to use the infrastructure: transport and flexibility. Line-pack flexibility is becoming increasingly important {{as a tool to}} balance gas supply and demand over different periods. In the European liberalized market context, a monopolist unbundled network operator offers regulated transport services and flexibility (balancing) services according to the network code and balancing rules. Therefore, gas policy makers should understand the role and consequences of line-pack regulation. The analysis shows that the line-pack flexibility service has an important economic value for the shippers and the TSO. Furthermore, the analysis identifies distorting effects in the gas market due to inadequate regulation of line-pack flexibility: by disregarding the sunk costs of flexibility in the balancing rules, the overall efficiency of the gas system is decreased. Finally, the analysis demonstrates that the actual costs of line-pack flexibility are related to the peak cumulative imbalance throughout the <b>balancing</b> <b>period.</b> Any price for pipeline flexibility should, therefore, be based on the related trade-off between the right to use the line-pack flexibility and the provision of transport services.

It is a kind of working time layout, which allows the employees to be assigned work in a certain period to the extent that will meet the needs of employers. Employees are simultaneously paid permanent or flat wage. In this kind of layout, the employee is not legally entitled to the assignment of work within the extent of the weekly working time. The first part of the thesis explains the basic concepts of working time and working time account, including their regulation in the Labour Code. Furthermore, this section {{deals with the}} use of flexible forms of work in the Czech and Slovak Republics. It was found that in both countries, in comparison with other European countries, flexible forms of work, including the working time accounts, are not as popular.

To support cities to become sustainable the German Fraunhofer Society on applied research formed a research network under the brand name »Morgenstadt – City of the future«. Urban energy systems are a relevant research topic since energy {{is very important for}} cities to become sustainable. The transformation of an urban energy system to a sustainable energy system based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) needs several years at least for large cities. New technologies, equipment and infrastructure must be developed and installed for generation, conversion, storage, distribution and consumption of electricity, heat and cold, and energy sources for transport. At the beginning of the transformation, an ENERGY MASTER PLAN must be developed including the ENERGY TARGET SYSTEM and the ENERGY ROADMAP, which describes the path to achieve the ENERGY TARGET SYSTEM. A procedure to develop the ENERGY MASTER PLAN step-by-step is described. An extensive involvement of main stakeholders and strong governance structures are important to implement such a process successfully. To identify the optimal ENERGY TARGET SYSTEM the ENERGY TARGET must be set precisely. Especially the origin of the RES and the <b>balancing</b> <b>period</b> must be well defined. Based on that ENERGY SYSTEM SCENARIOS can be simulated and the TARGET ENERGY SYSTEM identified. Since the fluctuating solar energy and wind energy are usually the main RES used, temporally resolved simulations of ENERGY SYSTEM SCENARIOS are necessary.

Measured amounts of a diet first-limiting in threonine or lysine were fed by intubation each day for 4 d to give a range of intakes (unbalanced series) of from 0 to 239 mg threonine/kg or 0 to 40 mg lysine/kg body weight.

40|$|Small graphite-moderated and gas-cooled {{reactors}} {{have been}} around {{since the beginning of the}} atomic age. Though their existence in the past has been associated with nuclear weapons programs, they are capable of being used in civilian power programs. The simpler design constraints associated with this type of reactor would make them ideal for developing nations to bolster their electricity generation and help promote a greater standard of living in those nations. However, the same benefits that make this type of reactor desirable also make it suspicious to the international community as a possible means to shorten that state?s nuclear latency. If a safeguards approach could be developed for a fuel cycle featuring one of these reactors, it would ease the tension surrounding their existence and possibly lead to an increased latency through engineered barriers. The development of this safeguards approach follows a six step procedure. First, the fuel cycle was analyzed for the types of facilities found in it and how nuclear material flows between facilities. The goals of the safeguards system were established next, using the normal IAEA standards for the non-detection and false alarm probabilities. The 5 MWe Reactor was modeled for both plutonium production and maximum power capacity. Each facility was analyzed for material throughput and the processes that occur in each facility were researched. Through those processes, diversion pathways were developed to test the proposed safeguards system. Finally, each facility was divided into material balance areas and a traditional nuclear material accountancy system was set up to meet the established safeguards goals for the facility. The DPRK weapons program is a great example of the type of fuel cycle that is the problem. The three major facilities in the fuel cycle, the Fuel Fabrication Facility, the 5 MWe Reactor, and the Radiochemical Laboratory, can achieve the two goals of safeguards using traditional methods. Each facility can be adequately safeguarded using methods and practices that are relatively inexpensive and can obtain material <b>balance</b> <b>periods</b> close to the timeliness limits set forth by the IAEA. The Fuel Fabrication Facility can be safeguarded at both its current needed capacity and its full design capacity using inexpensive measurements. The material <b>balance</b> <b>period</b> needed for both capacities are reasonable. For the 5 MWe reactor, plutonium production is simulated to be 6. 7 kg per year and is on the high side of estimates. The Radiochemical Laboratory can also be safeguarded at its current capacity.

Objective: Our aim {{was to determine the}} development of nitrogen balance during pregnancy compared with nitrogen balance before pregnancy in women consuming imposed constant diets. We also tracked changes in muscle mass and lean body mass by measuring urinary 3 -methylhistidine (3 -MeH) and urinary creatinine. Design: Nitrogen balance was determined over 8 d in 12 healthy Dutch women before pregnancy and at weeks 12, 23, and 34 of gestation. Complete daily diets were supplied during each <b>balance</b> <b>period</b> so that each subject's energy, protein, and macronutrient intakes were similar in amount and composition in all 4 <b>balance</b> <b>periods.</b> Results: Throughout pregnancy there was no significant change in loss of nitrogen in feces and therefore no change in protein digestibility. The amount of nitrogen excreted in urine in late pregnancy (11. 0 ± 1. 4 g/d) was significantly (P < 0. 01) less than in early pregnancy (12. 6 ± 1. 3 g/d). Nitrogen retention increased toward term, even though energy balance became progressively negative. The difference between the first (- 0. 4 ± 1. 7 g N/d) and third (1. 2 ± 1. 6 g N/d) trimester was significant (P < 0. 05). No differences were found in either 3 -MeH or creatinine excretion between trimesters. Conclusions: These urinary nitrogen excretion and nitrogen retention data show that when the dietary supply remains constant, nitrogen balance increases toward the end of pregnancy, suggesting a more efficient use of dietary protein later in pregnancy.
