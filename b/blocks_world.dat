Bryant scored 23 of his 30 {{points in the}} fourth quarter, and Gasol had 22 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and three <b>blocks.</b> <b>World</b> Peace played 15 minutes in the game, returning 12 days after his surgery though initial estimates were six weeks. In his absence, D'Antoni was using a reduced seven-man rotation with Bryant playing close to all 48 minutes each game. The next night, the Lakers played in Portland, where they had lost 12 of their previous 14 and, since 2002, 17 of their past 21. Portland appeared vulnerable without three starters and starting four rookies, but they led 95–90 in the fourth quarter. The Lakers came back to win, 113–106, as Bryant scored 47 points while playing all 48 minutes. It was the Lakers' first sweep in back-to-back games after 16 attempts during the season. Gasol also had 23 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while Howard contributed 20 points and 10 rebounds. Bryant, Gasol, and Howard combined for 90 points, their highest of the season. The Lakers moved a full game ahead of the Jazz with three games remaining, all at home, against playoff-bound Golden State, San Antonio and Houston.|$|E

The mechanisms for learning and decision-making are generic {{in the sense that}} they are the same for all animats. The goal of the decision-making is always the same: to keep the needs as satisfied as possible for as long as possible. All learning is driven by surprise relating to need satisfaction. The learning mechanisms are of two kinds: (i) structural learning that adds nodes and connections to the memory structure; (ii) a local version of multi-objective Q-learning. The animats are autonomous and capable of adaptation to arbitrary <b>block</b> <b>worlds</b> without any need for seed knowledge...|$|R

50|$|The <b>blocks</b> <b>world</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{planning}} domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of wooden blocks of various shapes and colors sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved. Moreover, some kinds of blocks cannot have other blocks stacked on top of them.|$|E

5000|$|Winograd {{grew up in}} Colorado and {{graduated}} from Colorado College in 1966. He wrote SHRDLU as a PhD thesis at MIT in the years from 1968-70. In making the program Winograd was concerned {{with the problem of}} providing a computer with sufficient [...] "understanding" [...] {{to be able to use}} natural language. Winograd built a <b>blocks</b> <b>world,</b> restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated [...] "world of toy blocks". The program could accept commands such as, [...] "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box" [...] and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, [...] "I do not know which block you mean." [...] The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or [...] "brittle" [...] such programs are.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{formalization}} of the <b>blocks</b> <b>world</b> {{on the basis}} of the situation calculus and circumscription, and investigate its mathematical properties. The main theorem describes the effect of the circumscription which solves the frame problem in the presence of ramifications.
