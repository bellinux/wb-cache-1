2500|$|In mule {{spinning}} the roving is {{pulled off a}} bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several different speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause {{a break in the}} yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> known as a [...] "cop", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled ring spinning.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{activity}} that originates from the sinoatrial node is propagated via the His-Purkinje network, the fastest conduction pathway within the heart. The electrical signal travels from the sinoatrial node (SAN), which stimulates the atria to contract, to the atrioventricular node (AVN) which slows down conduction {{of the action}} potential, from the atria to the ventricles. This delay allows the ventricles to fully fill with blood before contraction. The signal then passes down through a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> called the bundle of His, located between the ventricles, {{and then to the}} purkinje fibers at the bottom (apex) of the heart, causing ventricular contraction. This is known as the electrical conduction system of the heart, see figure 4.|$|E
50|$|Twisting in the {{opposite}} direction is due to the tensions resulting from the yarn twisting that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure. The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to increasedtwisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in {{the opposite}} direction from the original twist direction balance the yarn’s torque.These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread core. Although thicker yarns are less twisted than fine ones, the inner tension rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming. Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension imparted to the yarn by twisting.|$|E

50|$|Coherent Fibre OpticsIf a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> {{could be}} {{arranged}} {{such that the}} ends of the fibres were in matching locations at either end, then focusing an image {{on one end of the}} bundle would produce a 'pixel-ated' version at the further end which could be viewed via an eyepiece or captured by a camera. A German medical student, Heinrich Lamm produced a crude coherent bundle in the 1930s of perhaps 400 fibres. Many of the fibres were misaligned and it lacked proper imaging optics. It also suffered from leakage where adjacent fibres touched; which degraded the image still further. To produce a useful image, the bundle would need to contain not a few hundred but tens of thousands of fibres all correctly aligned. In the early 1950s, Hopkins devised a way to accomplish this. He proposed winding a single continuous length of fibre in a figure-of-eight around a pair of drums. Then, when sufficient turns had been added, a short section could be sealed in resin, cut through and the whole straightened out to produce the required coherent bundle. Having polished the ends, he was then able to add the optics he had designed to provide an objective and eyepiece. Once enclosed in a protective flexible jacket the 'fibroscope' (now more commonly called a fiberscope) was born. Details of this invention were published in papers by Hopkins in Nature in 1954 and Optica Acta in 1955. However, the bare fibres still suffered from light leakage where they touched. At the same time a Dutchman, Abraham van Heel was also trying to produce coherent bundles and had been researching the idea of cladding each fibre to reduce this 'cross-talk'. In fact he published details of his work in the very same issue of Nature. Eventually a system for cladding fibres with a layer of glass of lower refractive index was developed (see Larry Curtis et al.) which reduced the leakage to such an extent that the full potential of the fiberscope was realised.|$|E

Secondly, (i) the position, the orientation, the displacement and the deformation of each fibre together with (ii) the position and the evolution of each fibre-fibre contact were followed during the compression. The tracking of these microstructure descriptors allows the consolidation micro-mechanisms to be analysed and provides useful information for theoretical or numerical models used to predict fibre bundle deformation during processing of fibre bundle reinforced polymer composites...|$|E
40|$|This paper focusses on the {{prediction}} {{of one of the}} main mechanisms of acoustic attenuation, the dynamic drag impedance, of a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> typical of lightweight fibrous porous materials. The methodology uses geometrical properties derived from microscopy, and {{is based on the assumption}} that the interaction between the shear stress fields of neighbouring fibres may be neglected in the predicted drag force of an individual fibre. An analytical procedure is discussed which provides an estimate of the drag forces acting on infinite longitudinal and transversely orientated cylinders oscillating sinusoidally in a viscous incompressible fluid of infinite extent, at rest. The frequency-dependent viscous drag forces are estimated from the shear stresses on the surface of the cylinders, and may be scaled in terms of fibre diameter distributions and orientation angles in order to predict the dynamic drag impedance of a real material. The range of validity for this modelling approach is assessed through finite element solutions of three different fibre arrangements. QC 20170419 </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that increasing the resting {{length of the}} masseter and temporalis muscles by a bite-opening appliance with or without detachment and re-attachment of the masseter would not affect the contractile properties of these muscles. Appliances opened the bite of 10 adult female monkeys 20 mm. Five received the appliance alone (Group A); five received the appliance and in addition the masseter was detached and re-attached (Group ADR). Comparisons were made 48 weeks later. Small <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> were excised from the masseter and temporalis muscles of experimental animals and from 8 control animals.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model for}} yielding, inspired by fracture models {{and the failure of}} a sheared granular medium in which the applied shear is resisted by self-organized force chains. The force chains in the granular medium (GM) are considered as a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> of finite strength amongst which stress is randomly redistributed after any other fibre breaks under excessive load. The model provides an exponential distribution of the internal stress and a log-normal shaped distribution of failure stress, in agreement with experimental observations. The model displays critical behaviour which approaches mean field as the number of random neighbours $k$ becomes large and also displays a failure strength which remains finite in the limit of infinite size. From comparison with different models it is argued that this is an effect of uncorrelation. All these macroscopic properties appear statistically stable with respect to the choice of the chains' initial strength distribution. The investigated model is relevant for all systems in which some generic external load or pressure is borne by a number of units, independent of one another except when failure of a unit causes load transfer to some random choice of neighbouring units.

40|$|Various anode-cathode {{configurations}} in a nerve cuff are modelled {{to predict}} their spatial selectivity characteristics for functional nerve stimulation. A 3 D volume conductor {{model of a}} monofascicular nerve {{is used for the}} computation of stimulation-induced field potentials, whereas a cable model of myelinated nerve fibre is used for the calculation of the excitation thresholds of fibres. As well as the usual configurations (monopole, bipole, longitudinal tripole, ‘steering’ anode), a transverse tripolar configuration (central cathode) is examined. It is found that the transverse tripole is the only configuration giving convex recruitment contours and therefore maximises activation selectivity for a small (cylindrical) <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in the periphery of a monofascicular nerve trunk. As the electrode configuration is changed to achieve greater selectivity, the threshold current increases. Therefore threshold currents for fibre excitation with a transverse tripole are relatively high. Inverse recruitment is less extreme than for the other configurations. The influences of several geometrical parameters and model conductivities of the transverse tripole on selectivity and threshold current are analysed. In chronic implantation, when electrodes are encapsulated by a layer of fibrous tissue, threshold currents are low, whereas the shape of the recruitment contours in transverse tripolar stimulation does not change...|$|E

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} fibrils have circular {{cross sections}} with radii mostly distributed in between 50 and 100 nm and {{are characterized by}} an axial banding pattern with a period of 67 nm. The constituent long molecules of those fibrils, the so-called triple helices, are densely packed but their nature is such that their assembly must conciliate two conflicting requirements : a double-twist around the axis of the fibril induced by their chirality and a periodic layered organization, corresponding to the axial banding, built by specific lateral interactions. We examine here how such a conflict could contribute to {{the control of the}} radius of a fibril. We develop our analysis with the help of two geometrical archetypes : the Hopf fibration and the algorithm of phyllotaxis. The first one provides an ideal template for a twisted <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> and the second ensures the best homogeneity and local isotropy possible for a twisted dense packing with circular symmetry. This approach shows that, as the radius of a fibril with constant double-twist increases, the periodic layered organization can not be preserved without moving from planar to helicoidal configurations. Such changes of configurations are indeed made possible by the edge dislocations naturally present in the phyllotactic pattern where their distribution is such that the lateral growth of a fibril should stay limited in the observed range. Because of our limited knowledge about the elastic constants involved, this purely geometrical development stays at a quite conjectural level...|$|E
40|$|Externally Bonded (EB) {{composite}} materials {{are becoming a}} widespread solution for strengthening interventions on masonry buildings, even Cultural Heritage structures, due to several positive aspects mainly related to their high strength-to-weight ratio. In recent years, beside common epoxy-based Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP), steel-based composites have been proposed: they are composed by unidirectional high-strength steel cords that can be coupled to either organic (Steel Reinforced Polymers, SRP) or inorganic (Steel Reinforced Grouts, SRG) matrices, {{in relation to their}} optimized spacing. The bond behaviour of all these EB composites has a strong influence over the effectiveness of interventions, since the detachment of reinforcements from the substrate generally represents the weaker failure mechanism. In order to improve this aspect, several anchorage devices have been proposed, being spikes, among them, one of the most suitable for masonry supports. Spikes are made of a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> partly {{in the form of a}} bar, to be inserted and glued into a hole drilled in the substrate, and partly loose, to be spread and connected to reinforcement strips.

Focused on the spike-to-masonry connection, this paper is aimed at investigating the performance of steel cord spikes applied to existing clay brick masonry, by means of overall 39 pull-out tests carried out taking into account the bonded length (equal to the hole depth), the type of embedding material and the number of steel cords forming the anchorage.

40|$|Seven new 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-phenylalanine {{derivatives}} were synthesized {{in order}} to investigate {{the effect of the}} amino acid chirality on the gelating properties of these small molecules in water. Gelation tests have shown that enantiomerically pure homochiral 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-L-phenylalanine is a non-hydrogelator as it crystallizes from water, whereas the heterochiral derivatives with either two L-phenylalanine moieties and one D-phenylalanine (LLD), or vice versa (DDL), are very good hydrogelators. Concentration-dependent gel-to-sol transition-temperature (T-gs) curves for LLD or DDL gels show a siamoidal behaviour, which is in contrast to the logarithmic curves generally observed for gels derived from low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs). Such sigmoidal behaviour can be related to interactions between fibre bundles, which give rise to intertwined bundles of fibres. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of LLD and DDL gels show a network of thin, unbranched, fibre bundles with diameters of 20 nm. Right-handed twisted fibre bundles are present in the LLD gel, whereas left-handed structures can be found in tile DDL gel. Each <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> consists of a finite number of primary fibres. Gels consisting of mixtures of gelators, LLD and DDL, and nongelators (LLL or DDD) were investigated by means of T-gs measurements, CID spectroscopy and TEM.

Furthermore, it was found that peripheral functionalization of the homochiral derivatives LLL or DDD by means of a second amino acid or a hydrophilic moiety can overcome the effect of chirality; this process in turn leads to good hydrogelators...|$|E
