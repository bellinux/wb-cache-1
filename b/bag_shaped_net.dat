40|$|March 5 - 6, 2009, Bangkok, ThailandTo reduce {{incidental}} {{mortality of}} sea turtles in a pound net, a new releasing system {{was developed to}} allow turtles {{to escape from the}} bag net. The turtle releasing device with flapped vent has already been developed for small-scaled pound nets, but seems ineffective for large-scaled pound nets because the turtles rarely encounter the device in a large bag net. This study examined the validity of the sloping upper panel for guiding sea turtle to the releasing device in the bag net. Tank experiments were performed with three types of experimental bag nets: a box-shaped net with horizontal upper panel, one with square-pyramid shaped upper panels of 10 degrees (10 degrees slope <b>net),</b> and square-pyramid <b>shaped</b> <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> with upper panel of 20 degrees (20 degrees slope net). Five loggerheads in captivity (SCL: 42. 8 cm- 50. 0 cm) were prepared. The turtle swam around after entering the bag net, and about five minutes later it started to push its head up against the upper panel. In the 20 degrees slope net, the turtle moved to the shallowest space of the net. This suggested that the sloping upper panel guided the loggerhead turtle to the releasing device in the bag net of a largescaled pound net...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an antenna especially {{designed for a}} RFID passive tag working at UHF (867 MHz), for healthcare applications. In particular for the transfusional medicine and the blood supply chain. The tag {{has to be able}} to work placed on the top of a blood bag, while the bag is full of blood, and the antenna has been designed with this goal in mind. Therefore we require an antenna able to work close to a (relatively large amount of) lossy medium with high permittivity. Moreover, the <b>bag</b> <b>shape</b> is curved but its shape cannot be predicted exactly, so that the antenna must retain its behavior for a large set of different environments. In order to comply with all those requirements, a printed slot antenna built with a exible substrate has been selected, so that the whole tag can be exible too. The first step was the optimization of the working parameters of the antenna while placed on a perfect planar surface (i. e., assuming the blood bag to be a parallelepiped). Since the actual <b>bag</b> <b>shape</b> is not known, this choice allows to take into account the lossy material, but using a simple geometry. The antenna has been optimized to get the maximum reading distance. Then we consider the effects of a real blood bag (i. e., a curved one), filled with blood, on the antenna behavior. We consider a bag with a transverse section bounded by two arc of circles (with a radius quite larger than the bag size). Since we found a reasonable agreement with the planar antenna we can assume that the antenna behavior is quite insensitive to the <b>bag</b> <b>shape.</b> A robustness analysis, respect to the bag curvature radius, has been performed, too, to assess the antenna use in real environments...|$|R

40|$|A novel roll-platen {{forming process}} {{described}} in this paper has been proposed {{for the production of}} elongated components to <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> or near <b>net</b> <b>shape.</b> Although significant progress in <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> forging has been achieved in circular and axisymmetric components through flashless forging with completely closed die cavity techniques, similar progress has not been reported for elongated components. The feasibility of this process has been demonstrated through physical modelling experiments with Plasticine. This process essentially consists of a single roll and a flat platen. The platen can move with a speed equal to or higher than that of the peripheral speed of the roll. When it moves with a higher speed, the deformed workpiece becomes curved. With this characteristic, the roll-platen forming process seems promising for the manufacture of curved elongate components to near <b>net</b> <b>shape.</b> This paper presents an investigation of how the curvature is influenced by the speed ratio.

40|$|Bearings are {{products}} {{which are usually}} manufactured in mass production. For {{a long period of}} time, metal cutting technologies were dominant in this field of production. However, due to significant material waste, this way of ring production has been abandoned and replaced by more efficient methods. For that reason, several procedures- based on the application of near and <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> forming technologies such as forging, extrusion and rolling- have been developed. The introduction of near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> forming technologies in bearing industry has led to significant savings in material, time, energy and man power, especially for rings with complex profiles.

Fabrication processes of <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> / near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> components, such as uniaxial die-pressing, cold isostatic pressing (CIP), sintering, roll compaction and stamping, have been evaluated.

Up to 96. 4 % theoretical density has been achieved with the press-and-sinter technology. Tensile properties of the consolidated samples exhibit good ductility as well as equivalent yield/ultimate tensile strengths to those of fully consolidate materials, even with the presence of a certain amount of porosity.
