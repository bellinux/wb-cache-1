25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait.</b> The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|E
500|$|The {{impact was}} a {{substantial}} news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television. There {{was a genuine}} suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over {{the result of the}} impact. Various experts debated whether the impactor would go straight through the comet and out the other side, would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated [...] "All we can do now is sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait.</b> Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done." [...] In the final minutes as the impactor hit the comet, more than 10,000 people watched the collision on a giant movie screen at Hawaii's Waikiki Beach.|$|E
500|$|Fearless, {{the fifth}} ship {{of that name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard on 15 November 1911, {{launched}} on 12 June 1912 and completed in October 1913. The ship was assigned to the 1st LCS when she commissioned that same month. Fearless was serving {{as the leader of the}} DF as of 18 July 1914 and was transferred, together with her flotilla, to the Harwich Force after the start of the war. On the morning of 4 August, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, led the 1st and 3rd Destroyer Flotillas on a patrol southeast to the vicinity of Borkum, one of the East Frisian Islands, off the Dutch coast. Fearless and her flotilla encountered nothing of note, but the 3rd Flotilla sank the German minelayer , although they accidentally sailed over the minefield that she'd just laid on the return voyage and Fearlesss sister ship [...] struck a mine and sank. On the morning of 17 August, the 1st DF was at sea when some of its destroyers were attacked by the light cruiser [...] They correctly identified the German ship, but Fearlesss lookouts misidentified her as an armoured cruiser and her captain ordered his ships to fall <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> for assistance. After learning of the mistake, he ordered his ships to turn around and attack Stralsund, but it was too late and the Germans had turned for home after misidentifying a distant British ship as another cruiser.|$|E

2500|$|The convoy and escorts {{sailed through}} [...] "Bomb Alley" [...] between Crete and Cyrenaica {{under attack from}} Axis bombers, dive-bombers, torpedo-bombers, E-boats and {{submarines}} and were then threatened by the sailing of an Italian battlefleet from Taranto. The British relied on aircraft and submarines to repel the Italian fleet {{in the absence of}} battleships and aircraft carriers but only one heavy cruiser was sunk. When the Italian battleships were within [...] the British convoy and escorts were ordered to turn <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> for the Italians to suffer losses from torpedo-bombers, bombers and submarines but little more damage was inflicted and after several more turns towards and away from Malta, the convoy and escorts returned to Alexandria on 16 June. The Battle of Gazala (26 May – 21 June) was being fought in Libya during Operation Julius and beginning on 14 June, the British defeat forced the Eighth Army to withdraw eastwards, losing landing grounds from which aircraft could provide air cover for MW11.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to his battalion, he is {{detailed}} for a {{party to}} the front line by the colonel within an hour; when the narrator arrives six weeks later, he discovers Penrose is under arrest for cowardice {{in the face of the}} enemy. It transpired that each time the party advanced, it had to break for the ditches to avoid shellfire, then regroup and move further; after some time, Penrose decided to fall <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> under cover for the shelling to halt. Seeing a dugout down the road, they make a run for it under shellfire – to find it occupied by a senior officer, himself sheltering from the shelling, who promptly reports that [...] "he had seen the officer in charge and some of the party running down the road – demoralized" [...] and is ordered to arrest him and return. Penrose is court-martialled on these charges, and convicted; the court's recommendation for mercy is ignored, and he is shot one morning, a week later, by a party of men from his own company.|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Wender and Klein {{point out}} that pessimism {{can be useful in}} some circumstances: [...] "If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a {{conservative}} game plan of sitting <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources." ...|$|R
2500|$|On stage eleven to La Toussuire, Froome rolled {{all day in}} the {{mountains}} {{in front of the}} pack or near it, setting the pace for his leader Wiggins, but he was forced to take two rests during the flatter, faster sections, dropping in behind Wiggins' group, leaving Wiggins out in front. Froome recovered well, however, and in a surprising event, due to what appear to be confused team orders, he attacked the remaining group on the last climb, just as Wiggins was easing off after the hard chase to catch Nibali [...] away from the finish line. He subsequently received the order from his team manager to hold <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> for yellow jersey Wiggins. He finished third of the stage after a late burst of speed. For his efforts in assisting Wiggins, Froome was lauded in the media as a super-domestique. On stage seventeen, Froome and Wiggins finished second and third respectively on the final mountain stage to further cement their general classification positions, although Froome repeatedly waited for Wiggins on the final climb, costing him the chance of winning the stage. On stage nineteen, a time trial, Froome finished second to Wiggins, mirroring the overall standings. Wiggins {{went on to win the}} tour with Froome second, becoming the first two British riders to make the podium of the Tour de France in its 109-year history (Although Wiggins finished fourth in the 2009 Tour de France he was later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong's results were annulled in 2012).|$|E
2500|$|Rivière {{assaulted}} Nam Định {{the following}} day. [...] He disembarked his force at 11 a.m., after a devastating five-hour bombardment of the citadel by the gunboats. The attack force numbered just under 600 men, as Rivière supported the marine infantry and Cochinchinese riflemen with the landing companies of the gunboats Pluvier and Fanfare. [...] The troops went ashore {{in a suburb}} beyond the city's outer walls {{and were able to}} advance under cover of the buildings until they reached the main defences. [...] In accordance with Rivière's plan, capitaine du génie Dupommier used dynamite charges to blow in the gate of the eastern demilune, then the eastern gate of the citadel. [...] Dupommier and his party of engineers came under heavy fire from the Vietnamese defenders as they advanced to lay their charges, and had to fall <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> for covering fire before making a second attempt. [...] Once both gates had been blown in, the French charged into the citadel. [...] Rivière led from the front, urging on his troops as they fought their way into the city and setting an example of personal courage. [...] The Vietnamese resisted fiercely, but were overwhelmed by the superior firepower and morale of the French. [...] By late afternoon the city was in French hands and its governor in flight. [...] Sailors from Fanfare and Pluvier reached the summit of the citadel together. [...] Unable to agree on who was first to the top, they hauled down the Annamese flag and hoisted two French flags in its place.|$|E

In so doing, he's attempted to reverse the Segway back. As a result of that he's got into difficulty." ...|$|R
