5|$|Blizzard {{posted a}} release {{date for the}} game's first beta of Summer 2009, but failed to release a beta during that time. Since May 6, 2009, it was {{possible}} to sign up for the <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> of the game. In November 2009, the game's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured fans that it would happen next year. In February 2010, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month. On February 17, 2010, StarCraft II began closed beta testing, as promised. The beta was expected to last for 3–5 months. Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $400. Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9. According to the company, they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of beta testing. As of July 23, 2010, eighteen patches had been released for the beta (only seventeen on European servers), including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor. On May 12, 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X, for the users who had signed up. On May 17, 2010, Blizzard announced that {{the first phase of the}} beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31, but it was later extended to June 7. The second phase began on July 7, 2010, and ended on July 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Development of Dota 2 {{began in}} 2009 when IceFrog, the pseudonymous lead {{designer}} of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve to create a modernized sequel. Dota 2 was officially released on Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers in July 2013, following a Windows-only public <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> that began two years prior. Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, the game was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor. The game initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported to Source 2 in 2015, making it the first game to use it. Since its release, Dota 2 {{has been one of}} the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise being produced for it, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and hero cosmetics, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop and curated by Valve.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the inaugural}} event of The International, several other eSport events began to {{transition}} from Defense of the Ancients to Dota 2, including the Electronic Sports World Cup. DreamHack would also support Dota 2 in 2011, following a year without {{support for the}} original, on account of other MOBA titles such as Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends. By {{the end of its}} first year in its <b>beta</b> <b>phase,</b> Dota 2 was one of the highest-paying eSport titles of 2011, second only to StarCraft II. In 2012, Dota 2 began as an official title for the World Cyber Games annual event at World Cyber Games 2012. The Electronic Sports League (ESL) began a seasonal tournament for Dota 2 called the RaidCall EMS One in 2013, which was the largest independent tournament for Dota 2 by the beginning of 2013. Beginning in September 2013, the Association for Chinese eSports began a league, called the WPC ACE Dota 2 League, which had the largest third-party prize pool in Dota 2 eSports history at the time. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, Nexon announced the investment of two billion South Korean won, (approximately $1.7 million), into amateur and professional leagues in South Korea for 2013, to coincide with the launch of their distribution agreement in the fall of that year. Modeled after the interactive compendium for The International, Valve introduced a compendium third-party tournament organizers could sell, beginning with DreamLeague in February 2014. In February 2015, the Valve-sponsored Dota 2 Asia Championships was held in Shanghai with a prize pool of over $3 million, raised through compendium sales.|$|E
500|$|Tantalum {{exists in}} two {{crystalline}} phases, alpha and beta. The alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft; it has {{body-centered cubic structure}} (space group Im3m, lattice constant a = 0.33058nm), Knoop hardness 200–400 HN and electrical resistivity 15–60 µΩ⋅cm. The <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> is hard and brittle; its crystal symmetry is tetragonal (space group P42/mnm, a = 1.0194nm, c = 0.5313nm), Knoop hardness is 1000–1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170–210 µΩ⋅cm.

The W3C pre-beta phase uses a system of numbers up to 0.99, which indicated that these builds were in alpha-quality and the browser could have new features. The <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> changed the version numbering to a system consisting of the word [...] "Beta-" [...] beta followed by a number. After the beta-phase, the final product would have the version 1.0. After Yggdrasil overtook the development, the development status was changed from the W3C beta builds back to alpha, implying that the Arena browser wasn't yet ready for release. The beta-3e version numbering then became 0.3.5 in GNU style Development remained in alpha stage until 0.3.62, and never again advanced to beta.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{pressure}} {{effects on}} three different AlOOH structures (alpha, gamma, and <b>beta</b> <b>phases)</b> are systematically analyzed by density functional theory with different exchange and correlation energy functional approximations, namely two local, two generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), and two GGA for solids (GGAsol). Phase stability, compressibility and hydrogen bond evolution are studied {{in a range}} of pressures from 0 to 30 GPa. In general, the use of GGAsol functionals is mandatory in order to have the correct phase stability order, a good description of the hydrogen bonds, and a close agreement with the experimental lattice parameters at the various pressures. Pressure-induced hydrogen-bond symmetrization is found in gamma and <b>beta</b> <b>phases</b> at high compression, while the hydrogen bonds in the alpha phase remain asymmetric. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties on the values of the bulk moduli and their pressure derivative at zero pressure deduced by fitting calculated or experimental (P, V) data is also presented...|$|R
500|$|Dota 2 {{was first}} made {{available}} to the public at Gamescom in 2011, coinciding with the inaugural International championship, the game's premier eSport tournament event. At the event, Valve began sending out closed beta invitations, with the first few being sent out shortly after Gamescom. During the event, Newell speculated that Dota 2 would likely ship in 2012, despite original plans for a full release in late 2011. In September 2011, Valve scrapped its previous development and release plans, which would have kept the game in its closed <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> for over a year. The new plans, which IceFrog revealed via an online announcement, were to begin beta testing as soon as possible and to implement the remaining heroes afterward. Simultaneously, Valve announced that the non-disclosure agreement for the beta was being lifted, allowing testers to discuss the game and their experiences publicly.|$|E
500|$|Gard was keen to animate the {{character}} realistically, an aspect {{he felt the}} industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with {{the character}} more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols {{was inspired by the}} film Hard Boiled and an Æon Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, [...] "It had been dropped from the original because it just didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves – it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came {{up with a way to}} get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked." [...] There is a misconception that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent and the rest of the creative team argued to keep the change. Gard, however, has stated thasich notion [...] "came out of a silly remark made in an interview". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the <b>beta</b> <b>phase</b> of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).|$|E

Following the selection of beta testers, the amount of traffic caused the site to crash for a short time. Once the website was placed back up it was revealed that third-party professional testers would be testing the game, and several open <b>beta</b> <b>phases</b> would begin in the near future. The purpose of these <b>beta</b> <b>phases</b> is to test server capacity as players download the game and whether the servers provided can handle the intense use.
