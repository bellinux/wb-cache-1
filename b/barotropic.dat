5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are classified}} mainly as baroclinic, because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient known as frontal zones.

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become <b>barotropic</b> late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is <b>barotropic</b> in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1950s, {{numerical}} forecasts {{with computers}} became feasible. The first weather forecasts derived this way used <b>barotropic</b> (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude Rossby waves, that is, {{the pattern of}} atmospheric lows and highs. In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a Ferranti Mercury.|$|E
25|$|In 1776, Laplace {{formulated}} {{a single}} set of linear partial differential equations, for tidal flow {{described as a}} <b>barotropic</b> two-dimensional sheet flow. Coriolis effects are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the fluid dynamic equations. But {{they can also be}} derived from energy integrals via Lagrange's equation.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} the {{dispersion}} relation allows for two modes: a <b>barotropic</b> mode where the free surface amplitude is large compared with the amplitude of the interfacial wave, and a baroclinic mode where the opposite is the case – the interfacial wave is higher than and in antiphase with the free surface wave. The dispersion relation for this case is of a more complicated form.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>barotropic</b> atmosphere, where {{density is}} a {{function}} only of pressure, a horizontal pressure gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars, the isobars will be thicker. This causes {{the slope of the}} isobars to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} pressure force.|$|E
500|$|In September 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby {{assembled}} {{an international}} group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) {{based on the}} <b>barotropic</b> equation. Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Weather Bureau. [...] The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer <b>barotropic</b> model, also developed by Charney. [...] It only modeled {{the atmosphere in the}} Northern Hemisphere. [...] In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two-layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates. The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the [...] and [...] geopotential height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them. [...] However, due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model, the JNWPU reverted to the single-layer <b>barotropic</b> model in 1958. [...] The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959. [...] The first real-time forecasts made by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single-layer <b>barotropic</b> model.|$|E
500|$|Tested in 1989 and 1990, The Vic Ooyama <b>Barotropic</b> (VICBAR) {{model used}} a cubic-B spline {{representation}} of variables for the objective analysis of observations and {{solutions to the}} shallow-water prediction equations on nested domains, with the boundary conditions defined as the global forecast model. [...] It was implemented operationally as the Limited Area Sine Transform <b>Barotropic</b> (LBAR) model in 1992, using the GFS for boundary conditions. [...] By 1990, Australia had developed its own storm surge model which {{was able to be}} run in a few minutes on a personal computer. [...] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) developed its own Typhoon Model (TYM) in 1994, [...] and in 1998, the agency began using its own dynamic storm surge model.|$|E
500|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient, they can sometimes become <b>barotropic</b> late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform along the radius {{from the center of}} low pressure. [...] An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection, which warms its core and causes temperature and dewpoint gradients near their centers to fade.|$|E
500|$|Thermal wind is a {{meteorological}} term not {{referring to}} an actual wind, but {{a difference in}} the geostrophic wind between two pressure levels [...] and , with in essence, wind shear. It is only present in an atmosphere with horizontal changes in temperature (or in an ocean with horizontal gradients of density), i.e. baroclinicity. In a <b>barotropic</b> atmosphere, where temperature is uniform, the geostrophic wind is independent of height. The name {{stems from the fact that}} this wind flows around areas of low (and high) temperature in the same manner as the geostrophic wind flows around areas of low (and high) pressure.|$|E
500|$|The {{vertical}} coordinate {{is handled}} in various ways. Lewis Fry Richardson's 1922 model used geometric height (...) as the vertical coordinate. Later models substituted the geometric [...] coordinate with a pressure coordinate system, {{in which the}} geopotential heights of constant-pressure surfaces become dependent variables, greatly simplifying the primitive equations. [...] This correlation between coordinate systems can be made since pressure decreases with height through the Earth's atmosphere. The first model used for operational forecasts, the single-layer <b>barotropic</b> model, used a single pressure coordinate at the 500-millibar (about [...] ) level, and thus was essentially two-dimensional. High-resolution models—also called mesoscale models—such as the Weather Research and Forecasting model tend to use normalized pressure coordinates referred to as sigma coordinates. [...] This coordinate system receives {{its name from the}} independent variable [...] used to scale atmospheric pressures with respect to the pressure at the surface, and in some cases also with the pressure {{at the top of the}} domain.|$|E
500|$|The first {{successful}} numerical prediction was performed using the ENIAC digital computer in 1950 {{by a team}} composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and computer programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. [...] They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the <b>barotropic</b> vorticity equation over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the geopotential height of the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface. [...] This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day. [...] When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an [...] "enormous scientific advance." [...] The first calculations for a 24‑hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24hours to produce, but Charney's group noted that {{most of that time}} was spent in [...] "manual operations", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Barotropic</b> models {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly <b>barotropic,</b> {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. [...] In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. [...] It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. [...] In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. [...] Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones). A <b>barotropic</b> model tries to solve a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics {{based on the assumption that}} {{the atmosphere is}} in geostrophic balance; that is, that the Rossby number of the air in the atmosphere is small. If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the <b>barotropic</b> vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately [...] is mostly divergence-free, the <b>barotropic</b> model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a geopotential height corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|E

2500|$|This {{atmospheric}} model assumes both molecular weight and temperature are constant {{over a wide}} range of altitude. Such a model may be called isothermal (constant temperature). Inserting constant molecular weight and constant temperature into the equation for the ideal gas law produces the result that density and pressure, the two remaining variables, depend only on each other. [...] For this reason, this model may also be called <b>barotropic</b> (density depends only on pressure).|$|E
2500|$|Of course, {{one might}} wonder {{whether we are}} {{justified}} in assuming that [...] The answer is affirmative, if the flow satisfies certain basic assumptions. In particular, if [...] and , then the assumed relation follows directly from the linear theory of sound waves (see, e.g., the linearized Euler equations and the acoustic wave equation).

2500|$|An {{atmospheric}} {{model is a}} mathematical model constructed around the full set of primitive dynamical equations which govern atmospheric motions. It can supplement these equations with parameterizations for turbulent diffusion, radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, the kinematic effects of terrain, and convection. Most {{atmospheric model}}s are numerical, i.e. they discretize equations of motion. They can predict microscale phenomena such as tornadoes and boundary layer eddies, sub-microscale turbulent flow over buildings, as well as synoptic and global flows. The horizontal domain of a model is either global, covering the entire Earth, or regional (limited-area), covering {{only part of the}} Earth. [...] The different types of models run are thermotropic, <b>barotropic,</b> hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic. [...] Some of the model types make assumptions about the atmosphere which lengthens the time steps used and increases computational speed.|$|E
50|$|A fluid {{which is}} not <b>barotropic</b> is baroclinic, i. e., {{pressure}} {{is not the only}} factor to determine density. For a <b>barotropic</b> fluid or a <b>barotropic</b> flow (such as a <b>barotropic</b> atmosphere), the baroclinic vector is zero.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>barotropic</b> flow is a {{generalization}} of a <b>barotropic</b> atmosphere. It is a flow {{in which the}} pressure {{is a function of}} the density only and vice versa.

5000|$|The {{density of}} most liquids is nearly {{constant}} (isopycnic), {{so it can}} be stated that their densities vary only weakly with pressure and temperature.

50|$|In fluid dynamics, a <b>barotropic</b> fluid is a fluid whose {{density is}} a {{function}} of pressure only. The <b>barotropic</b> fluid is a useful model of fluid behavior {{in a wide variety of}} scientific fields, from meteorology to astrophysics.|$|E

Hence, the motions of a rotating <b>barotropic</b> air mass is strongly constrained.
