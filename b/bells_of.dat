5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E
5|$|Some {{relics of}} the Bastille survive: the Carnavalet Museum holds objects {{including}} one of the stone models of the Bastille made by Palloy and the rope ladder used by Latude {{to escape from the}} prison roof in the 18th century, while the mechanism and <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> the prison clock are exhibited in Musée Européen d'Art Campanaire at L'Isle-Jourdain. The key to the Bastille was given to George Washington in 1790 by Lafayette and is displayed in the historic house of Mount Vernon.

5|$|The Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin {{dates from}} the late 11th century and was rebuilt in the 15th century. The tower {{contains}} eight <b>bells,</b> <b>of</b> which two {{were made in the}} 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has moulded string courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. There is a church room, built in 1827. The Baptist Church in Holyrood Street was built in 1842.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{formally}} inspected by the Railway Inspectorate on 1 July 1889, {{and the first}} official service on the line left Chesham for London's Baker Street at 6.55am on 8 July 1889. Throughout the day large crowds flocked to Chesham station to watch the trains, and the arrival and departure of each train at Chesham was greeted with peals of the <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> St. Mary's Church. Over {{the course of the}} day 1,500 passengers travelled on the line, and 4,300 used the line in its first week of operations.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1980s to {{the first}} half <b>of</b> the 1990s, <b>Bell</b> <b>of</b> Pennsylvania, also called Pennsylvania Bell, kept its {{traditional}} identity.

5|$|In 1746 Thomas Bilbie, from Chew Stoke in Somerset, {{created a}} new bell foundry (The West of England Church Bellfoundry) in the town, paying an annual rent of £1/13/4 (£1.67) for {{premises}} in the Almshouse building. He recast the six <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> Cullompton church as eight new ones. In 1754 Thomas's eldest son also called Thomas moved to Cullompton {{to take over the}} bell foundry. Over a period of 26 years he cast 239 bells, the majority for churches in Devon. When he died, aged 53 in 1780, his son Thomas Castleman Bilbie took over the business and cast 197 bells from 1780 to 1813. The business was then sold to Pannell and Co. who moved it to Exeter in 1850.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found {{throughout}} the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay put and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church <b>bells</b> <b>of</b> the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.|$|E
