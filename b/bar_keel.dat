In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length.

2500|$|The {{most common}} type of keel is the [...] "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the {{majority}} of ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the [...] "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, <b>bar</b> <b>keels</b> often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.|$|R
40|$|This {{test program}} {{evaluated}} aluminum, steel, and fiberglass lifeboats in one- to three-minute liquid spills fires {{to determine which}} type of lifeboat provides superior resistance to a transitory deck fire. Each lifeboat consisted of a half-hull built on a continuous <b>keel</b> <b>bar</b> with side benches, and foam-filled flotation devices. Eight half-hulls, three of aluminum, two of steel, and three of fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP), were tested. A specially designed pen permitted videotaping the exterior and interior hull surface during actual fires. A water spray necessary to protect the superior lifeboat during a long-term fire was also calculated and tested. The results indicated: (1) aluminum lifeboats melt and collapse when exposed to one-minute deck fires, (2) steel lifeboat hulls remain intact, but the interior structures and buoyancy tanks {{would have to be}} extinguished before the lifeboat would be useable, (3) FRP lifeboats provide good fire resistance and retain superior lifesaving capabilities, and (4) a water spray application rate of 0. 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to study phase transformations in cast superaustenitic stainless steels. Experiments were performed to determine the phase transformation behavior for alloys CN 3 MN and CK 3 MCuN. Samples were taken from <b>keel</b> <b>bars</b> that were heat treated between 1160 and 1230 °C and then isothermally held for times ranging from 1 min to 2040 h at temperatures in the range of 700 - 900 °C. The resulting microstructures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy. The microstructures, composed primarily of sigma- and Laves-phases within a purely austenitic matrix, showed relatively slow transformation kinetics, with transformation not completed even after the longest anneals. SEM and TEM analysis of superaustenitic samples reveal that precipitation takes place initially on grain boundaries and proceeds intragranularly. The results of these SEM and TEM investigations, along with volume fractions and number densities as a function of time and temperature, will be presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|South Steyne is a double-ended, double-screw {{steamship}} {{constructed to}} ocean-going standards. The hull is riveted steel, with a <b>bar</b> <b>keel,</b> 8 watertight bulkheads and a double bottom under the engine only. At 70 metres long {{she was the}} world's largest operational steam ferry. The steel superstructure rises to sun deck level, with teak decks and wheelhouses. One of her two funnels is a dummy, containing a water tank.|$|E
