40|$|Abstract. This thesis {{focuses on}} the definitions, {{characterizations}} and quantifications of ecological disturbances, as well as hypotheses on their impacts on biological communities. The most prominent model on effects of disturbance on diversity is the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), which is utilized in management of national reserves, has received over 3300 citations and has been corroborated by a multitude of studies from terrestrial and aquatic systems. According to the predictions of the IDH, diversity is high at intermediate levels of disturbance due to coexistence of competitors and colonizers. At low levels of disturbance diversity will be low due to competitive exclusion and few species can persist at high levels of disturbance. In {{an extension of the}} IDH, the Dynamic Equilibrium Model (DEM) predicts that the effects of disturbance depend on the productivity of communities, because at high growth rates a stronger disturbance is required to counteract increased rates of competitive exclusion. The IDH and the DEM were tested in a field experiment on effects of physical disturbance (scraping) and productivity (nutrient availability) on hard-substratum assemblages in paper I, where the patterns predicted by the IDH, but not the DEM, were observed. This outcome shows the importance of the nature of productivity alterations, as the productivity treatment had a general positive effect on growth rates but only marginal effects on the dominant species, thereby leaving rates of competitive exclusion unaffected. In paper II I tested another extension of the IDH, which predicts that smaller, more frequent disturbances will have different effects on diversity compared to larger, less frequent disturbances. In this experiment I used two different regimes of disturbance, small and frequent vs. large and infrequent disturbances, while the overall rate (the product of area and frequency) was kept equal for both regimes. At the site where the IDH was supported, the regime with {{a large proportion of the}} area disturbed infrequently showed higher richness, due to a stronger decrease of dominants, compared to the regime with a small proportion disturbed frequently. In addition to these significant differences in diversity effects between different disturbance regimes, it may also matter what agent of disturbance that is causing the damage. In paper III I contrasted the effects of a physical disturbance (wave-action) to that of a <b>biological</b> <b>disturbance</b> (grazing), as well as their respective interactions with productivity in a multifactorial design tested on natural epilithic assemblages. The composition of assemblages and the total species richness was significantly affected by physical disturbance and interactively by <b>biological</b> <b>disturbance</b> and productivity. The algal richness was significantly affected by productivity and <b>biological</b> <b>disturbance,</b> whereas the invertebrate richness was affected by physical disturbance. The results show, for the first time, that <b>biological</b> <b>disturbance</b> and physical disturbance interact differently with productivity due to differences in the distribution and selectivity among disturbances. In paper IV I investigate how the choice of diversity measure may impact the outcomes of tests of the IDH, which, surprisingly, has not previously been discussed. This was done by an extensive literature review and meta-analysis on published papers as well as by two different approaches to mathematical modelling. Both models support the IDH when biodiversity is measured as species richness, but not evenness. The meta-analysis showed that two-thirds of the published studies in the survey present different results for different diversity measures. Hence, the choice of diversity measure is vital for the outcome of tests of the IDH and related models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{reciprocal}} {{interaction of}} landscape structure and ecological processes is {{a cornerstone of}} modern landscape ecology. We use a simulation model to show how landscape structure and herbivory interact to influence outbreaks of southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann) in a landscape representative of the southern Appalachian Moun-tains, USA. We use LANDIS and its <b>biological</b> <b>disturbance</b> agent module to simulate the effects of landscape composition (proportion of landscape in host area) and host aggregation on the size and severity of insect outbreaks and {{the persistence of the}} host species, Table Mountain Pine (Pinus pungens Lamb.). We find that landscape composition is less important in the modeled landscapes than host aggregation in structuring the severity of insect outbreaks. Also, simulated southern pine beetle outbreaks over time tend to decrease the aggregation of host species on the landscape by fragmenting large patches into smaller ones, thereby reducing the severity of future outbreaks. Persistence of Table Mountain pine decreases throughout all simulations regardless of landscape structure. The results {{of this study indicate that}} when considering alternative restoration strategies for insect-affected landscapes, it is necessary to consider the patterns of hosts on the landscape as well as the landscape composition...|$|E

Depressed patients demonstrated significantly higher basal glucose levels, greater cumulative glucose responses after the GTE, and larger cumulative insulin responses after the GTT than control subjects.

40|$|Beef cow-calf farming {{systems are}} assumed to be {{resilient}} to <b>biological</b> <b>disturbances</b> that induce variations in herd demography; however, this hypothesis has not been fully investigated to date. Modeling is an interesting approach to study farming system resilience and to evaluate the impact of <b>biological</b> <b>disturbances,</b> taking into account interactions between system components, including biological variability and management practices. Our objective was to evaluate the resilience of beef cow-calf farming systems to variations in fertility and mortality using a modeling approach. We studied the direct effect of variations in demographic parameters on production objectives without explicitly representing the causes of the variations. We developed a stochastic model to represent the population dynamics of a beef cow-calf herd with breeding by natural service and biological processes occurring at the animal level. The model was validated by comparing observed and simulated distributions of the calving-to-calving interval, which were found to be consistent. Resistance was evaluated by the proportion of simulations where the objective in terms of number of weaned calves is reached even when there is a disturbance that persists for 10 yr. Reversibility was evaluated by the time needed to return to the predisturbance production level. Beef cow-calf farming systems {{did not appear to be}} resistant to variations in mortality and infertility rates except when increases in the infertility rates were low (0. 02 for cows and 0. 03 for heifers). Critical situations, consequently, may emerge with regard to farm production if management practices are not adapted. Reversibility was observed for disturbances that persist for up to 5 yr. However, the system needed 2 to 3 yr to recover its predisturbance production level and up to 4 yr after an increase in cow infertility of 0. 12...|$|R
40|$|Summary: <b>Biological</b> and {{physical}} <b>disturbance</b> {{has had a}} severe impact on New Zealand’s endemic flora and fauna. Along with {{the lessons of the}} past, predicting the sensitivity of communities to disturbance in the future may help direct more attention to those communities with a greater need for preservation (i. e., a lower ability to recover from any such disturbances). In theory it is possible to measure the resilience (or local stability) of a community by constructing a matrix to describe that community and then examining its eigenvalues. Local stability characteristics of invertebrate communities in 11 aquatic habitats were examined with respect to differing levels of habitat disturbance. It was predicted that communities in more unstable habitats would be more resilient in order to persist despite more frequent disturbances. All communities had eigenvalues outside the stability criteria, although those in the unstable habitats did have eigenvalues closer to these criteria. The open and/or patchy nature of stream communities may explain why local stability is not a prerequisite for these communities, however examining the local stability of community matrices still remains a potentially useful tool for predicting the effects of physical and <b>biological</b> <b>disturbances...</b>|$|R

40|$|The recent {{invasion}} of San Francisco Bay by the suspension-feeding clam Potamocorbula arnu-rensis has {{provided an opportunity}} to document the ecological consequences of a major <b>biological</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Previous work {{over the last two}} decades has shown that phytoplankton biomass in the upper estuary is low (2 - 3 mg Chl a m-') during seasonal periods of high river flow and short residence time, and it is usually high (peak> 30 mg Chl a m- 3) during the summer-autumn seasons of low river flow and long residence time. However since P. amurensis became widespread and abundant in 1987, the summer phytoplankton biomass maximum has disappeared, presumably because of increased grazing pressure by this newly introduced species. For the period 1977 - 1990, mean estimated primary production was only 39 g C m-Z yr-I during years when bivalve suspension feeders were abundant (> 2, 000 m-'), compared to 106 g C rn-> yr-I when bivalves were absent or present in low numbers. These observations support the hypothesis that seasonal and interannual fluctuations in estuarine phytoplankton biomass and primary production can be regulated jointly by direct physical effects (e. g. river-driven transport) and trophic interactions (episodes of enhanced grazing pressure by immigrant populations of benthic suspension feeders) ...|$|E
