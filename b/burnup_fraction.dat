2500|$|Early studies include Project Daedalus, {{performed}} by the British Interplanetary Society in 1973–1978, and Project Longshot, a student project sponsored by NASA and the US Naval Academy, completed in 1988. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, [...] "Discovery II", designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, based on the D3He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, {{has been described by}} a team from NASA's Glenn Research Center. It achieves characteristic velocities of >300nbsp&km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10−3 g, with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%. Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept's 2.2% <b>burnup</b> <b>fraction</b> it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000nbsp&km/s.|$|E
40|$|The {{resulting}} dose consequences from {{releases of}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) residing in a dry storage casks are examined parametrically. The dose consequences are characterized by developing dose versus distance curves using simplified bounding assumptions. The dispersion calculations are performed using the MELCOR Accident Consequence Code System (MACCS 2) code. Constant weather and generic system parameters were chosen {{to ensure that the}} results in this report are comparable with each other and to determine the relative impact on dose of each variable. Actual analyses of site releases would need to accommodate local weather and geographic data. These calculations assume a range of fuel <b>burnups,</b> release <b>fractions</b> (RFs), three exposure scenarios (2 hrs and evacuate, 2 hrs and shelter, and 24 hrs exposure), two meteorological conditions (D- 4 and F- 2), and three release heights (ground level - 1 meter (m), 10 m, and 100 m). This information was developed to support a policy paper being developed by U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff on an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) and monitored retrievable storage installation (MRS) security rulemaking...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{tests with}} {{irradiated}} Zircaloy-clad fuels from Robinson, Oconee, Saxton, and Point Beach reactors with burnups from about 200 to 28, 000 MWD/MTHM {{have been made}} to determine the dissolution behavior of both voloxidized (U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }) and nonvoloxidized (UO{sub 2 }) fuel. No significant technical problems were encountered in batch-dissolving of either form. Dissolution rates were well-controlled in all tests. Significant characteristics of U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } dissolution that differed from UO{sub 2 } dissolution included: (1) reduced tritium and ruthenium ({sup 106 }Ru) concentrations in product solutions, (2) increased insoluble noble metal fission product residue (about 2. 2 X greater), and (3) increased insoluble plutonium in the fission product residue. The insoluble plutonium is easily leached from the residue by 10 M HNO{sub 3 }. The weight of the fission product residue collected from both U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } and UO{sub 2 } fuels increased aproximately linearly with fuel <b>burnup.</b> A major <b>fraction</b> (> 83 %) of the {sup 85 }Kr was evolved from U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } fuel during dissolution rather than voloxidation. The {sup 85 }Kr evolution rate was an appropriate monitor of fuel dissolution rate. Virtually all of the {sup 129 }I was evolved by air sparging of the dissolver solution during dissolution. 30 tables, 18 figures...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project {{was to assess the}} feasibility of improving the performance of PWR and BWR cores by using solid hydride fuels instead of the commonly used oxide fuel. The primary measure of performance considered is the bus-bar cost of electricity (COE). Additional performance measures considered are safety, fuel bundle design simplicity – in particular for BWR’s, and plutonium incineration capability. It was found that hydride fuel can safely operate in PWR’s and BWR’s without restricting the linear heat generation rate of these reactors relative to that attainable with oxide fuel. A couple of promising applications of hydride fuel in PWR’s and BWR’s were identified: (1) Eliminating dedicated water moderator volumes in BWR cores thus enabling to significantly increase the cooled fuel rods surface area as well as the coolant flow cross section area in a given volume fuel bundle while significantly reducing the heterogeneity of BWR fuel bundles thus achieving flatter pin-by-pin power distribution. The net result is a possibility to significantly increase the core power density – on the order of 30 % and, possibly, more, while greatly simplifying the fuel bundle design. Implementation of the above modifications is, though, not straightforward; it requires a design of completely different control system that could probably be implemented only in newly designed plants. It also requires increasing the coolant pressure drop across the core. (2) Recycling plutonium in PWR’s more effectively than is possible with oxide fuel by virtue of a couple of unique features of hydride fuel – reduced inventory of U- 238 and increased inventory of hydrogen. As a result, the hydride fuelled core achieves nearly double the average discharge <b>burnup</b> and the <b>fraction</b> of the loaded Pu it incinerates in one pass is double that of the MOX fuel. The fissile fraction of the Pu in the discharged hydride fuel is only ~ 2 / 3 that of the MOX fuel and the discharged hydride fuel is more proliferation resistant. Preliminary feasibility assessment indicates that by replacing some of the ZrH 1. 6 by ThH 2 {{it will be possible to}} further improve the plutonium incineration capability of PWR’s. Other possibly promising applications of hydride fuel were identified but not evaluated in this work. A number of promising oxide fueled PWR core designs were also found as spin-offs of this study: (1) The optimal oxide fueled PWR core design features smaller fuel rod diameter of D= 6. 5 mm and a larger pitch-to-diameter ratio of P/D= 1. 39 than presently practiced by industry – 9. 5 mm and 1. 326. This optimal design can provide a 30 % increase in the power density and a 24 % reduction in the cost of electricity (COE) provided the PWR could be designed to have the coolant pressure drop across the core increased from the reference 29 psia to 60 psia. (2) Using wire wrapped oxide fuel rods in hexagonal fuel assemblies it is possible to design PWR cores to operate at 54 % higher power density than the reference PWR design that uses grid spacers and a square lattice, provided 60 psia coolant pressure drop across the core could be accommodated. Uprating existing PWR’s to use such cores could result in 40 % reduction in the COE. The optimal lattice geometry is D = 8. 08 mm and P/D = 1. 41. The most notable advantages of wire wraps over grid spacers are their significant lower pressure drop, higher critical heat flux and improved vibrations characteristics...|$|R
