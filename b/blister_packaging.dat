25|$|On April 11, 2008, McFarlane Toys {{announced}} {{their plans to}} redesign their current packaging. Instead of having a full <b>blister</b> <b>packaging,</b> they have returned to their traditional cardback packaging. After their release, there have been mixed reactions from collectors mainly those who like to keep their figures mint on card. The lines to first debut this new packaging is the NFL Legends 4 and their Halo series 2 lines.|$|E
25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in <b>blister</b> <b>packaging.</b> It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive monthly data subscription.|$|E

25|$|Medication Event Monitoring Systems, in {{the form}} of smart {{medicine}} bottle tops, smart pharmacy vials (or smart <b>blister</b> <b>packages</b> are frequently used in clinical trials and other applications where exact compliance data are required. Such systems usually work without any patient input, and record the time and date the bottle or vial was accessed, or the medication removed from a <b>blister</b> <b>package.</b> The data can be read via proprietary readers, or NFC enabled devices, such as smartphones or tablets. There is evidence that the use of such devices can help improve adherence.|$|R
5000|$|Playart (the name in all {{lower case}} with a larger [...] "a" [...] in [...] "art" [...] and dots in the bowls of the letters) {{die-cast}} cars were made in Hong Kong and mostly were distributed with the name Peelers, the in-house brand of toy cars for Woolworth. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sears sold <b>blister</b> <b>packaged</b> Playarts as Road Mates. McCrory stores had a line of Playart vehicles called Freewheelers. They were blister-packaged on a blue, white and yellow card. Another Playart <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> stated [...] "Die cast metal - En metal moule", perhaps for the French market. In another twist the American distribution company for Playart was Model Power which focused on train accessories. The small sized cars were packaged under this name as Road Kings.|$|R
2500|$|... 80% {{of pills}} {{in the world}} are packed with <b>blister</b> <b>packaging,</b> which is the most {{convenient}} type for several reasons. Blister packs have two main components, the “lid” and the “blister” (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with aluminum (Al) and paper. The Cavity consists of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET) or aluminum (Al). If users employ proper disposal methods, all these materials can be recycled and the harmful effects to the environment can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.|$|E
2500|$|When the NHLPA {{figures were}} first released, they were cardback {{packaged}} {{but once the}} first NHL licensed series came out, McFarlane decided to use [...] "clamshell" [...] <b>blister</b> <b>packaging.</b> Since the Series 1 to Series 14, the figures {{have had the same}} packaging design. From the start of Series 15, the company decided to change the packaging design which took on a more [...] "streamline" [...] look. The Series 15 design would eventually evolve into a more compact version at the start of NHL 16 and Legends 6. The amount of space that was reduced would also influence the size of the new bases and also eliminated the addition of a net for goalies.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of colors and {{finishes}} that <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> can be constructed to feature. Manufacturers can use that to help make their products stand out on shelves. <b>Blister</b> <b>packaging</b> allows either the manufacturer or retailer to include promotional materials or advertisements to help build a brand and increase customer loyalty.|$|E

This was {{in place of the}} usual cardboard box. Some Mini-Dinkys were also <b>blister</b> <b>packaged</b> in a dark grey pack (some with garage and some not) with bright yellow lettering (Mini Dinky 2011).|$|R
50|$|<b>Blister</b> <b>packaging</b> is a cost {{effective}} way of showcasing a product. Due {{to the nature of}} the material and design, it makes it more {{cost effective}} than other types of packages that are on the market. There are several different types of <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> - Face Seal, Trap, Mock, Slide and Interactive. Each one has its unique qualities and price points, from entry level to high end.|$|E

40|$|Pharmaceutical high barrier <b>blister</b> <b>packages</b> are {{manufactured}} from aluminium-polymer laminate foils (e. g. consisting of PA-Al-PVC layers). By a cold stretch forming process cavities are formed. The {{aim of this}} work is to determine a homogenized elastic-plastic description of the laminate by micromechanics. Therefore, a microstructural model is developed where the layers are mapped in a representative volume element. The obtained homogenized material model is applied to simulate the stretch forming to gain more insight into the forming process...|$|R

5000|$|To {{compete in}} the global toy car market, Tomy early on, had plans of {{exporting}} its models. This was done starting in 1974 {{with the appearance of}} [...] "Tomy Pocket Cars" [...] in Canada and the United States of America. The marketing ploy was a <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> designed like a denim jeans 'pocket' with yellow 'stitching' around the outside of the card and the vehicle. Since Japanese cars were not yet booming sellers overseas, in 1976 Tomy started producing 'foreign' (non-Japanese) models. Present were American, German, Italian, British, and French cars, among others, making the Tomica product line more global.|$|R
50|$|To prevent retail theft, {{packages}} {{are specifically designed}} so that the customer cannot “touch and feel” the product.

50|$|Casado {{started his}} own design firm with his then-wife Barbara in 1970. He met Christopher Whorf, art {{director}} for Warner Bros. Records, and that relationship {{opened the door for}} Casado to do projects with Warner Bros., Capitol Records, A&M Records, United Artists and many smaller labels. He designed the Grammy Award-winning album cover for Mason Proffit’s Come and Gone (1973), art directed by Whorf. In 1978, he created the iconic logotype for The Band and The Last Waltz album and film, directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring appearances from Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and others. During that time, he also created a Warner Bros. Records sampler album, featuring Frank Zappa, which replicated a <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> of baloney making the three records inside baloney color.|$|R
5000|$|Though most Majorette {{models have}} since been made in Thailand, one {{exception}} was the Portuguese NOVACAR series acquired by Majorette. These were well-done models with plastic bodies and metal bases - for a time these cars were marketed as a new '100' series, but later regular Majorette models were also made in Portugal as <b>blister</b> <b>packages</b> were marked with red [...] "P"s, [...] "F"s, and [...] "T"s for Portugal, France, or Thailand.At this time, Majorettes began to lose the proud and familiar 'Made in France' on their bases and on packaging. Actually, the shiny metal base itself gradually disappeared from new models, replaced by ordinary black plastic, a cost saving solution common in many toy brands. The loss was not only visual or tactile - Majorettes lost their characteristic weight and solid feel.|$|R
5000|$|With the series' success, it was spun-off into Marvel Legends. At that point, the toyline {{ended and}} was {{replaced}} by a new one simply called Spider-Man on the packaging but [...] "Spider-Man Classic" [...] (notice the singular form) on ToyBiz's website. The new line has <b>blister</b> card <b>packaging,</b> and no comics are included.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> {{machines}} use {{heat and}} pressure via a die {{to form the}} cavity or pocket from a roll or sheet of plastic. In recent years, improvements in cold forming, specifically allowing steeper depth/angles during forming, which minimizes the amount of material used for each cavity—have helped this technology increase. The main advantages of the plastic-based blister pack are its more compact size compared to cold formed aluminum and its transparency to see the product.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of real {{time is not}} solved by simply generating data {{which is based on}} a proxy of ingestion. If such data isn't being parsed and used in an effective fashion to assist patients, caregivers and medical professionals with adherence management, then it is not a useful application of expensive resources. It can be argued that the highest and best use of technologies such as smart <b>blister</b> <b>packages,</b> are in stratifying patient groups into good compliers and poor compliers. In this case, the poor compliers maybe coached more intensively, and the good compliers have a continued incentive to remain adherent. Real time in this case might be achieved by sending a regular series of SMS, frequency depending on their adherence status, and requesting them to upload their NFC sensor data through their handheld or wrist worn device.|$|R
5000|$|Club Series was {{introduced}} in 1990 and consisted of die-cast trucks and farm vehicles made in smaller scale (usually 1:87). These were similar to the Super Series in that the <b>blister</b> <b>packages</b> were {{the same size and}} shape as those of small cars. The only difference was that the packaging had a different design and read [...] "Siku Club." [...] However, after {{the first few years of}} production, the Club line was fully incorporated into the Super Series and adopted the Super packaging design. Interestingly, a few 1:55 models from the Super Series in the 08 price range were also packaged in the [...] "Siku Club" [...] package for a short period of time in 1992, when production switched from Germany to China (The Club Series vehicles have always been produced in China since their beginning in 1990).|$|R

[...] with the Danish flag and crown prominently shown (Hobby Talk 2008). The cars {{were more likely to}} be colored in more [...] "spectra-flame"-type colors, perhaps in an attempt to compete with Mattel's Hot Wheels. A few years ago, one of these was reported to have sold for $800.00.MPC also marketed some Tekno trucks and cars as MPC. These were castings made by Kirk (Hobby Talk 2008).

5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{material}} for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of <b>blister</b> <b>packaging</b> the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is {{sometimes referred to as}} Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical <b>blister</b> <b>packaging,</b> whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 [...] "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{first three}} series of figures took obvious {{influence}} {{from the original}} Mirage comics. The Turtles lacked pupils and had bulging muscles with large veins. The blister card art was also very unrefined and reflected the comics; in fact, Shredder's pose was based directly on art from the debut issue. Each figure had at least 7 points of articulation (neck, shoulders, wrists, hips), many accessories including the characters signature weapon, and a bio card {{on the back of}} the <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> that kids could cut out and collect. Also included was a fully illustrated origin story on the card's backside which was phased out during the 4th series. The figures boasted highly detailed sculpting, especially for the time. Colorful characters like General Traag, Rat King, Mutagen man, Scumbug, Pizza Face, Muckman, and many others featured intricate details such as small animals crawling over them, large scars, torn clothing, and pieces of garbage stuck to their bodies.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{trucks were}} {{produced}} {{with a basic}} unadorned black wheel design, while later ones incorporated a triangular chrome wheel that {{looked a lot like}} a Majorette design. Packaging in the 1980s was simple as trucks were held in flimsy plastic containers with an EFSI identification sticker on the lower side of the container. Later, more design and color was incorporated on a cardboard blister, but, still, the presentation was simpler than more developed diecast companies - no printing was usually seen {{on the back of the}} blister card. One interesting aspect of packaging was the eight sided STOP sign in red seen on the <b>blister</b> <b>packages</b> for EFSI Toys. The sign, which says [...] "code" [...] right next to it, seems to be a warning that the toy is unsafe for children under a certain age. Most EFSI toys were stamped 'Holland' or 'Made in Holland'. Blister packs for smaller trucks and cars were variously marked as Efsi RevWheels, Efsi Toppers, or Efsi Plus (Bras 2012a).|$|R
40|$|A new {{dry powder}} inhaler (DPI) for {{respiratory}} drug delivery was developed. This novel device {{is characterized by}} a micro-dose, passive delivery and multiple doses individually sealed in one replaceable disk. The micro-dose delivery system uses only a small amount of excipient, such as 2 - 3 mg lactose, thereby improving the drug delivery efficiency. The passive delivery method eliminates the need for coordination between breath and device actuation such as the pressure metered dose inhaler (pMDI). Finally, 14 doses on a disk reduce the need to frequently change dosage disks. In addition, each dose is effectively protected by a <b>blister</b> <b>package</b> to minimize damage from moisture and oxygen. A comprehensive evaluation on key parameters, including dosage emittion, air flow resistance and fine particle fraction, has been conducted. The air resistance of our device is about 0. 06 kPa 0. 5 ·min/liter, slightly higher than several marketed products but close to Inhalator®. The in vtiro performance results show that this new dry powder inhaler is able to achieve a high efficiency for drug delivery, with 10...|$|R
