40|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} in North America, Europe and Australia use different approaches for {{the estimation of}} exposure reduction effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) in registration processes of agrochemical pesticides. TNO has investigated current views and facts {{for the use of}} default values and set up a discussion paper which {{can be used as a}} starting point to achieve an internationally harmonised set of PPE protection factors for regulatory use. For inhalation exposure Loading it is proposed to use the assigned protection factors (APF) as deduced by BSI (<b>British</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Institution)</b> and ANSI (American National <b>Standards</b> <b>Institution).</b> Since these values are somewhat variance and since in agricultural settings efficient control and proper training and education with respect to inhalation protection devices is generally absent, it is good to err on the safe side and to use the Lowest of both values, if available. For dermal exposure Loading differentiations are made for operators and re-entry workers and further for hand and body protection. Next to this the restrictions and framework for the use of the proposed defaults are very relevant. Oral exposure loading is only considered in special cases where dermal exposure may be relatively high and the hand-mouth shunt may lead to appreciable oral exposure loading. The presented defaults for PPE have been discussed with experts of regulatory authorities and industry, but a formal discussion still has to take place. This needs to be done on EU level between Member States. The current proposal is based on state-of-the-art knowledge and policy considerations, but further research is needed to better underpin the proposed values and/or to adapt them...|$|R

After {{eight years of}} service, the TSA coating on the production risers and tethers was still in good condition. The condition in the splash zone was indistinguishable from other inspected components. However, there were notable differences between the production risers and the tethers. The tethers, having a vinyl sealer, showed a blistered surface, while the risers, with a silicone sealer, did not show any blistering. No corrosion has been observed underneath any of the blisters. The importance of adequate sealers in connection with blistering has been documented by testing. The excellent performance of TSA coating in the splash zone is further documented by field studies published {{in the last few}} years.

40|$|Problem statement: Organic {{soils and}} peat were {{believed}} to be geotechnically problematic due to their very high compressibility, very low shear strength and difficult accessibility. Although conventional soil mechanics theory could be applied to the soils, it was found that important anomalies existed which required special considerations. Correlations between geomechanical parameters for the soils were known to be important for geotechnical engineers to be able to obtain suitable design parameters, as well as to find suitable construction techniques on these soft materials. Approach: To evaluate the geomechanical characteristics of the soils, field and laboratory investigations were carried out according to the organic contents. To achieve such purpose, the soils samples having different organic contents from several locations in Malaysia were collected to determine the correlations of various geomechanical properties of the soils. The classifying tests were determined based on the test procedures according to the <b>British</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Institution.</b> The compressibility behavior of the soils was determined by Rowe cell consolidation test. Results: The test results indicated that the natural water contents, organic contents, liquid limits, specific gravities and bulk densities ranged from 150 - 700 %, 50 - 95 %, 180 - 500 %, 1. 05 - 1. 9 and 0. 8 - 1. 2 Mgm&# 61485; 3, respectively. The compression indexes of the soils were higher than Hobbs and Skemptons approximations. Conclusion/Recommendations: The soils properties were highly dependent on the organic contents. With an increase in organic content, the natural water content, liquid limit, compression index and void ratio increased and the specific gravity and bulk density decreased. Furthermore, the hemic and sapric peat had lower shear strength than the fibrous peat. The first-of-its-kind study was the first step on the road to persuade researchers to improve these problematic soils...|$|R
