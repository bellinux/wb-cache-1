5|$|Early {{education}} in Hagley was by private tutors. In 1855 a school {{opened in the}} Church of England building, taking in both borders and day scholars. Schooling had to sometimes <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> as the building was used during school hours for marriages, and religious services.|$|E
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover. The street was torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E

50|$|The {{match between}} Ethnikos Latsion and Anagennisi Trachoniou <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> at 2-0; It was awarded 3-0 to Ethnikos.*The match between Ethnikos Latsion and Achyronas Liopetriou <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> at 1-3; It was awarded 0-3 to Achyronas.|$|R
50|$|In bandy, {{the game}} is {{restarted}} with a face-off when the game has <b>been</b> temporarily <b>interrupted.</b> The face-off <b>is</b> executed on {{the place where the}} ball was situated when the game <b>was</b> <b>interrupted.</b> If the ball was inside the penalty area when the game <b>was</b> <b>interrupted,</b> the face-off <b>is</b> moved to the nearest free-stroke point on the penalty line.|$|R
5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E
5|$|Holm (1992) {{considers}} Egil's saga {{to equate}} the Kylfings with the Finnic Karelians. In the 14th century, when the Swedish kings began to direct their attention northwards and encourage Swedish colonization in Norrbotten, there were regulations that the Birkarls and the Saami peoples were not to <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> in their traditional activities. A {{large part of the}} Karelians were under Novgorod which was included in what Icelandic sources called Kylfingaland, and thus the Kylfings could have been Baltic Finnish tribes under Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{air-stream}} <b>is</b> <b>interrupted</b> periodically.|$|R
50|$|Matches {{consist of}} one innings per side, with fifty overs bowled per innings. Where matches <b>are</b> <b>interrupted</b> or delayed because of weather, {{the number of}} overs may {{be reduced to a}} minimum of 20. Duckworth Lewis is {{employed}} where a match <b>is</b> <b>interrupted</b> after it has started.|$|R

5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E
5|$|Wes and Rui {{then go to}} Realgam Tower. All four {{administrators are}} there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum {{at the top of}} the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice {{attempts}} to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested.|$|E

6000|$|At {{this point}} the {{conversation}} <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> by a loud burst of whistling, as the street-door opened and the strains of [...] "Rule Britannia" [...] filled the entire building. The music <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> by the sudden opening of another door, and a rough growl from a male voice.|$|R

25|$|Things {{began to}} change again for the Borgo during the French {{occupation}} under Napoleon. The Préfet of Rome, Camille de Tournon, started the demolition of the spina, but the project had to <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> shortly after it began {{due to a lack}} of funds.|$|E
25|$|Devices {{need to be}} {{installed}} in new premises and when repairs are carried out. Protection is required for power outlets and lighting, {{with the exception of}} emergency lighting that should not <b>be</b> <b>interrupted.</b> The standard device used in South Africa is indeed a hybrid of ELPD and RCCB.|$|E

25|$|A hat-trick {{occurs in}} cricket when a bowler dismisses three batsmen with {{consecutive}} deliveries. The deliveries may <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> by an over bowled by another bowler {{from the other}} end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.|$|E
25|$|At the 87th AES Convention in 1989, Dugan {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} using an automixer inserted within target channels on a professional audio mixer. Each microphone's signal would <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> inside its channel strip and sent to a variable gain circuit contained within the automixer. The signal would then be returned to the mixer at a level consistent with the Dugan algorithm. This became the Dugan Model D automixer.|$|E

25|$|A regular daily {{rest period}} may <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> {{no more than}} twice, but the total {{interruption}} must not exceed 1 hour in total. This allows for a vehicle to be driven on to a ferry and off again {{at the end of}} the crossing. Where the rest period is interrupted in this way, the total accumulated rest period must still be 11 hours. A bunk or couchette must be available during the rest period.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} rhythmical {{breathing in}} and out, can <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> by coughing, sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by {{the expression of}} a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated intakes of breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the standard role-playing gameplay, there are several minigame events that come up {{over the course of}} the game. The player can engage in swoop racing to gain money, and sometimes interplanetary travel will <b>be</b> <b>interrupted</b> by enemy starfighters, which begins a minigame where the player controls a turret to shoot down the opposing starcraft. The player can also engage in a card game known as pazaak, which is similar to the game of blackjack, to gamble money.|$|E
