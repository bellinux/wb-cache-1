25|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{maintained}} their {{claim that the}} crash {{was the result of}} Alvarez's aborted suicide attempt and he never intended to hurt anyone, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> claimed he deliberately caused the crash in an attempt to get attention from his estranged wife, citing that he doused his SUV with gasoline beforehand. A relative of one of the victims questioned why Alvarez did not simply lie down on the tracks if it was really a suicide attempt.|$|E
25|$|Espionage {{was already}} a talking point during the electoral campaign. Teodor Meleșcanu, who ran the Foreign Intelligence Service, {{resigned}} in September and joined the presidential race as an independent candidate one day later. Around the same time, Robert Turcescu, a popular television anchor, confessed live on air {{that he had been}} an undercover lieutenant-colonel for an espionage service and resigned his post. Under Romanian law, outing oneself as a spy is illegal, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> did not press charges.|$|E

He pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, {{and was sentenced to}} six months' probation and a small fine. Issa has said he believes the record has since been expunged.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{evidence}} against Müller was circumstantial, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutor</b> Mr Serjeant Ballantine made a strong case. Defence claims that Matthews had come forward only to receive the reward had little effect. Müller maintained his innocence throughout his three-day trial at the Old Bailey. After he was found guilty, {{he was sentenced to}} death. King Wilhelm I of Prussia (subsequently the Kaiser of Germany) failed to get the British Government to postpone Müller's execution.|$|R
50|$|Six {{was called}} {{as one of}} four {{witnesses}} by defense attorney Robert Servatius in the 1961 trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann, and gave his testimony by deposition in West Germany.

Six's testimony was introduced in Eichmann's defense, but proved to be of more help to the prosecution.|$|R

25|$|The case {{received}} {{national attention}} {{both for the}} brutality of the crime and for the controversial sentence. The crime was committed in Michigan, which {{does not have the}} death penalty, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in federal court were able to seek a death sentence because the murder took place on federal land. Gabrion is the first person in the United States to receive the death penalty for a crime committed in a non-death penalty state since federal capital punishment was reinstated in 1988 as well as the first person to be sentenced to death in the state of Michigan since 1937.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} stated {{they discussed}} Bradley's software discrepancy with Baez on June27, and {{he raised the}} issue in court testimony. Baez also asked Judge Perry to instruct the jury about this search information, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> disputed this {{and it was not}} done. Also on June 27, the defense called two private investigators who, in November 2008, had searched the area where the body was later found. The search was videotaped, but nothing was found. On June28, the defense called a Texas EquuSearch team leader who did two searches of the area and found no body. The defense then called Roy Kronk, who recounted the same basic story he told police about his discovery of Caylee Anthony's remains in December 2008. He acknowledged receiving $5,000 after the remains were identified, but denied that he told his son that finding the body would make him rich and famous. The next day, his son testified he had made such statements.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, Nasheed {{was arrested}} again {{and ordered to}} stand on trial for his {{decision}} to arrest Abdulla Mohamed in 2012 while he was the President. On 13 March 2015, Nasheed was sentenced to thirteen years in Maafushi Prison for abducting Abdulla Mohamed. He was charged under the Anti-Terrorism Act of Maldives. The three-judge bench unanimously found him guilty of ordering the arrest of Abdulla Mohamed in January 2012, when he held {{the office of the}} President. The ruling came four days after Nasheed's lawyers quit in protest against what they called was a biased trial aimed at destroying his political career. He was originally cleared of the charge but a few days later, the prosecutor general had him re-charged and arrested under tough anti-terror laws. The court rejected an objection from Nasheed’s lawyers that two of the judges were not suitable to hear the case because they had testified against Nasheed at a police inquiry on the judge’s arrest. The court also dismissed four witnesses produced by Nasheed’s lawyers before they even testified, saying they were not strong enough witnesses. Nasheed had earlier been charged with abuse of power <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> last month filed more serious charges under the country’s terrorism law. The trial was completed after 10 hearings over 23 days.|$|E

500|$|Pussy Riot {{said their}} protest was a {{political}} statement, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> said the band was trying to [...] "incite religious hatred" [...] against the Orthodox Church. In [...] "Putin Zassal", Pussy Riot had stated [...] "The Orthodox Religion is a hardened penis / Coercing its subjects to accept conformity", among other examples of the group's antagonism to the Church as an organization, which it views as corrupt. Thus central issues of the case were the definition of [...] "hatred" [...] against a religion, and whether blasphemy can exist in a secular state. Pavel Chikov, Chairman of the Agora Human Rights Association, said that defense lawyers were able to maximize publicity by creating [...] "a huge public outcry over the case", but {{at the expense of}} defendants' liability.|$|E

2500|$|The indictments {{charge that}} the lane {{closures}} were retribution against Sokolich for not endorsing Christie.

[...] Kelly vigorously denied wrongdoing. Baroni argued that his indictment was improperly based on the unsworn testimony and documents he had provided to the legislative committee in 2014, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> countered that he had not been offered immunity at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century, American courts have tried over 400 murders {{in which the}} victim's body had not been found; Bonie's case {{would have been the}} first in the Bronx. [...] "It's like running a 100-meter race when the {{criminal}} gets to start at the 20-meter mark," [...] a former federal prosecutor told the Times. “When you don't have a body, you don't have the best evidence in the crime."

2500|$|Press {{reported}} on November 6, 2006, {{the arrest of}} a construction worker Diego Pillco, a 19-year-old Ecuadorian illegal immigrant who according to police had confessed on tape to attacking Shelly, and then staging the fake suicide by hanging her. Pillco's original version of {{what happened was that}} when Shelly asked if the noise could be kept down, he threw a hammer at her and, afraid she would make a complaint that might result in his deportation, followed her back to her apartment, where the petite 40-year-old hit him, and was killed by a fall during a struggle. Subsequently, Pillco gave a completely different [...] account in which he said while on a break he had noticed Shelly returning to her apartment and followed her. After assaulting her and rendering [...] her unconscious, he killed her by staging the fake suicide. The second version was consistent with the lack of dust on Shelly's shoes (which she was not wearing when found) and seemed to be a confession to murder, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutors</b> reportedly thought if charged with murder Pillco might return to his original account and a jury trial could find him guilty of a lesser charge. The medical examiner determined that Shelly was still alive when hanged. Pillco pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years in prison without parole.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Malaysia Police {{took charge}} of {{investigations}} involving seven pirates who allegedly attacked MT Bunga Laurel in the Gulf of Aden on 20 January 2011. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Ismail Omar said the police were taking statements from the crew members of the vessel {{as well as the}} commandos from the navy elite PASKALs. Apparently all pirates, aged 15 to 35, had no identification documents on them. The police chief would also seek the Immigration Department's assistance. The suspects were brought to Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital in Klang for a medical examination after they arrived in Port Klang at 4:00am. They were detained at Bukit Jalil Detention Centre after the police had successfully obtained a seven-day remand order. Seven hijackers, including three minors, face a possible death sentence under Malaysian law for attempting to hijack Bunga Laurel. They were [...] prosecuted in the Magistrate Court on 11 February 2011, on charges of robbery with discharging their firearms at Malaysian forces with intent to cause death or seriously wound those on board the Bunga Laurel. The offences were committed on board the Bunga Laurel at the co-ordinates Latitude 20 '14.73N Longitude 083' 39.96E, 250 nautical miles from the coast of Oman. Under Section 3 of the Firearms Act (Increased Penalties) 1971 (Act 37) along with Section 34 of the Penal Code, the offence carries the mandatory death penalty if convicted. Earlier, Deputy Prosecutor Mohd Abazzafree Mohd Abbas told the court, all the accused did not speak Malay or English but the prosecution called one Somali student from Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), Yaser Mohamad Ahmad to translate for them. Malaysian prosecutors filed charges that carried the death penalty Friday against the seven pirate suspects in an attack on a Malaysian-operated ship, in the first such charge in Southeast Asia, and the second in Asia (after South Korea) against the African sea bandits. In bringing them here after rescuing the vessel and booking them, Malaysia is following in the steps of the US, Germany, South Korea and the Netherlands which have charged foreign pirates who attacked their vessels in international waters. The pirates were identified as Ahmed Othman Jamal (25), Abdil Eid Hasan (20), Koore Mohamed Abdile (18) and Abdi Hakim Mohd Abdi (18), and each were explained the charges in their native language in front of the Magistrate Siti Shakirah Mohtarudin. The names of three 15-year-old juveniles were not announced. All seven are accused of using firearms against the Malaysian forces--a charge which carries the death sentence. <b>But</b> <b>prosecutors</b> said three 15-year-old suspects would not face execution because they were too young. On September 2013, the Malaysian High Court sentenced four of the seven Somali to 4 years in prison, and the other three faced 7 years in prison.|$|E

In August 2015, he told a psychiatrist some of the [...] "most anti-social and violent thoughts" [...] the professional had heard, saying that voices were telling him to burn babies and maim prostitutes. Searches of Fairweather's possessions included documentaries about serial killers such as the Yorkshire Ripper, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutor</b> Paul Scothern clarified that not all people with such interests are intent on imitating the killers.|$|R

The alleged assault led to Daniel suffering severe bone fractures in her face. Willoughby claimed self-defense, <b>but</b> <b>prosecutor</b> Sherri Chun disagreed, saying [...] "This incident was not self-defense.
