As of 2004, she owned 26 {{purebred}} and 14 partbred Poitous, making hers the largest Poitou <b>breeding</b> <b>operation</b> in the United States, {{and the second}} largest in the world, behind the French government-sponsored experimental farm. Hamilton works with French officials toward {{the preservation of the}} breed, and has received praise from French veterinarians, who appreciate her technical and financial contributions to the breed. Techniques for using cryopreservation to develop a sperm bank for Poitou donkeys have been in development in France since at least 1997, but Hamilton has pioneered the use of artificial insemination using frozen semen in the breed, in order to use genetic material from France to improve Poitou herds in the US. The North American Baudet de Poitou Society, organized by the American Donkey and Mule Society, is the American registry for the breed, coordinating with French officials for inspections and registrations of American-bred Poitou stock.|$|E

[...] At its peak, Maynesboro was the largest Arabian horse <b>breeding</b> <b>operation</b> in the United States. [...] In 1929, he wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered an authoritative work on the Arabian breed. [...] He served as President of the Arabian Horse Club of America from 1918 until 1939. [...] Brown was a remount agent and had a special interest in promoting the use of Arabian horses by the U.S. Army Remount Service. [...] To prove the abilities of Arabians, he organized and participated in a number of endurance races of up to , which his horses won three times, retiring the U.S. Mounted Service Cup. This accomplishment occurred even though The Jockey Club donated $50,000 to the U.S. Army to buy Thoroughbreds that tried but failed to beat the Arabians. [...] Brown's legacy as a horse breeder was significant. Today, the term [...] "CMK", meaning [...] "Crabbet/Maynesboro/Kellogg" [...] is a label for specific lines of [...] "Domestic" [...] or [...] "American-bred" [...] Arabian horses, many of which descend from Brown's breeding program.

The Auburn University Alumni Association and many Auburn alumni contributed to the effort and a new eagle was located at the Tennessee Valley Authority Raptor Rehabilitation Facility in Land Between The Lakes, Kentucky. Trainers made the trip to the facility to receive Auburn's new mascot.

Smith, who managed the Bald Eagle and Osprey programs at Land Between the Lakes and just happened to have a son at Auburn.
