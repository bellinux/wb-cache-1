That redman, if I could judge, had the gift of information. He took language, and did with it all a Roman can do with macaroni. His vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes. And his syllables was smooth, and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea. I thought I'd heard him talk before, but I hadn't. And it wasn't the size of his words, but the way they come; and 'twasn't his subjects, for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture. Mrs. Conyers understood his accents, and the elegant sounds went back and forth <b>between</b> 'em. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Jefferson D.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 83 - 89). In {{the standard}} model of the Universe, the cosmos has only accelerated once since decoupling and only recently, at around a redshift of z ̃ 0. 5 as supported by different observations including Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Large Scale Structure (LSS), and Weak Lensing (WL). This confirmation however, lacks a fundamental physics explanation. The hypothetical form of energy termed 'dark energy' (DE) assumed to account for that acceleration behavior, is still mysterious and why its dominance only occurred recently is a profound problem widely known as the coincidence problem. So far all attempts for resolving the coincidence the problem have been unsatisfactory. Here we investigate a possible solution to the coincidence problem {{in the form of}} multiples phases of acceleration (MPA). If there were more than one phase of acceleration <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> decoupling, <b>then</b> the current phase of acceleration would be much less special, alleviating the coincidence problem. We use a modified Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique together with the WMAP five year TT data to search for parameters allowing a second phase of acceleration. Despite extensive search we find no models that simultaneously fit the WMAP data and yield a second phase of acceleration, ruling out this particular set of models as the solution to the coincidence problem...|$|R

This assessment covered the entire business and has enabled ecological sustainability to be assessed in terms of quantitative indicators. The LCA was performed by firstly examining a base case which would eventuate if Sydney Water maintained its current operations with only the modifications, augmentations and upgrades planned for implementation <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> 2021. We <b>then</b> performed a number of scenario analyses to examine the benefits of additional demand management, energy efficiency, energy generation, supply augmentation and effluent quality initiatives. The results indicated significant improvements are available {{and that some of}} these measures are more desirable than others. We also examined a scenario for the alternative delivery of water and wastewater services in new urban areas. This showed quantitatively that, since connecting new fringe suburbs to the existing system requires significant expenditure on energy for pumping, major improvements in the sustainability of water and wastewater systems can be achieved by using localised, water-saving alternatives...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that there did exist a typical “managing agency system” in pre-independent {{corporate}} India, which itself was a significant and powerful system of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach – This is a qualitative exploration and analysis of the nineteenth century model of corporate governance and its impact on industrialisation in pre-independent India. Findings – Initially, the system of managing agency was instrumental in improving the performances of companies through economies of scale and scope and other best practices. Gradually, over the century it became corrupt and opposed to the interests of majority of the stakeholders. However, the superstructure of the system, even though not backed by any legal framework, has been found to be solid and not inferior to the present day corporate governance system and practices. Research limitations/implications – Because of the absence of corporate data warehousing, and lack of presence of corporate and business literature in the nineteenth century, the research could not be made empirical. Much of comparisons could not be made <b>between</b> the <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> corporate practices, management style and financial performances. Practical implications – The findings and analysis of this paper provide a direction to the policy makers, governments and researchers in formulating an alternative model of corporate governance for sustainable development of the society. Originality/value – The paper is one of the few attempts made so far on the subject and rediscovers “managing agency system” in the light of the corporate governance practices of modern times. It has paved the path for further meaningful and value adding deliberations and researches. Control systems, Corporate governance, India, Quality management...|$|R

60|$|Ladies and gentlemen,--It may {{perhaps be}} in known to you that, {{for a few}} years past, I have been {{accustomed}} occasionally to read some of my shorter books, to various audiences, in aid of a variety of good objects, and at some charge to myself, both in time and money. It having at length become impossible in any reason to comply with these always accumulating demands, I have had definitively to choose <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reading on my own account, as one of my recognised occupations, or not reading at all. I have had little or no difficulty in deciding on the former course. The reasons that have led me to it--besides the consideration that it necessitates no departure whatever from the chosen pursuits of my life--are threefold: firstly, I have satisfied myself that it can involve no possible compromise of the credit and independence of literature; secondly, I have long held the opinion, and have long acted on the opinion, that in these times whatever brings a public man and his public face to face, on terms of mutual confidence and respect, is a good thing; thirdly, I have had a pretty large experience of the interest my hearers are so generous as to take in these occasions, and of the delight they give to me, as a tried means of strengthening those relations--I may almost say of personal friendship--which it is my great privilege and pride, as it is my great responsibility, to hold with a multitude of persons who will never hear my voice nor see my face. Thus it is that I come, quite naturally, to be here among you at this time; and thus it is that I proceed to read this little book, quite as composedly as I might proceed to write it, or to publish it in any other way.|$|E
6000|$|I don't care {{to recall}} the dreadful doubts and anxieties which began to beset me; the plan after plan which I tried, and in which I failed, for {{procuring}} work and adding to our dwindling stock of money. I bethought me of my friend Mr. Johnson, and when I think of the eager kindness with which he received me, am ashamed of some pert speeches which I own to have made regarding his manners and behaviour. I told my story and difficulties to him, the circumstance of my marriage, and the prospects before me. He would not for a moment admit they were gloomy, or, si male nunc, that they {{would continue to be}} so. I had before me the chances, certainly very slender, of a place in England; the inheritance which must be mine in the course of nature, or at any rate would fall to the heir I was expecting. I had a small stock of money for present actual necessity--a possibility, [...] "though, to be free with you, sir" [...] (says he), [...] "after the performance of your tragedy, I doubt whether nature has endowed you with those peculiar qualities which are necessary for achieving a remarkable literary success"--and finally a submission to the maternal rule, and a return to Virginia, where plenty and a home were always ready for me. [...] "Why, sir!" [...] he cried, [...] "such a sum as you mention would have been a fortune to me when I began the world, and my friend Mr. Goldsmith would set up a coach-and-six on it. With youth, hope, to-day, and a couple of hundred pounds in cash--no young fellow need despair. Think, sir, you have a year at least before you, and who knows what may chance <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Why, sir, your relatives here may provide for you, or you may succeed to your Virginian property, or you may come into a fortune!"
