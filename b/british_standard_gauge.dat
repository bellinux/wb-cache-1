50|$|Tony Miles' Adavoyle Junction in 1963 was an {{important}} early model railway using the P4 Finescale standards. The desire to model a local broad gauge prototype, without commercial model support, meant that scratchbuilding was necessary anyway and so the adoption of P4 was less of a change than was seen by <b>British</b> <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> modellers.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{fractional}} {{inch and}} gauge drill bit sizes are in common use. In nearly all other countries, metric drill bit sizes are most common, and all others are anachronisms or {{are reserved for}} dealing with designs from the US.

25|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} wire diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as <b>British</b> <b>Standard</b> Wire <b>Gauge</b> (SWG), but unlike IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used {{in most parts of the}} world. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.|$|R

A detailed analysis was also done for the falling dust and rain. The results obtained showed that the amount of the falling dust at Sakurajima county in this period was reduced to about on-half the amount in the last period. Maximum value of the sulfur oxide adsorption was 2. 42 mg/ 100 cm^. day which was detected at Sakurajima Hospital in May...|$|R

50|$|British Standard Wire Gauge {{is a set}} of wire sizes {{given by}} BS 3737:1964 (now withdrawn), and is {{generally}} abbreviated to SWG. It is also known as: Imperial Wire Gauge or <b>British</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Gauge.</b> Use of SWG sizes has fallen greatly in popularity, but is still used as a measure of thickness in guitar strings and some electrical wire. Cross sectional area in square millimetres is now a more popular size measurement. The current British Standard for metallic materials such as wire and sheet is BS 6722:1986, which is a solely metric standard.|$|E
5000|$|When {{building}} the Norwegian Trunk Railway (1850-1854), Robert Stephenson built {{the line in}} accordance with <b>British</b> <b>standards</b> of <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> and overdimensioned bridges and curves. This line was very expensive; Pihl argued that narrow-gauged railways would be less expensive to construct. After studying foreign designs, C. W.

During the railway construction boom of the 1870s and 1880s all but the Kongsvinger Line, the Meråker Line and the Østfold Line were built with narrow gauge, leaving Norway with two incompatible systems.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to new builds, {{the company also}} took on repair work, as in the late 1920s, both Good Luck, originally launched on 21 March 1904, and Motorman from 24 March 1925 were on stocks on the main slipway at the same time. Motorman, which was a twin-screw tug, fitted with two Gardner diesel engines, each developing , was used to transfer railway carriages from Carlton near Nottingham on the River Trent to Hull in 1927. 160 carriages were built by Cammell Laird for export to India. They could not be transported by rail, because they were built to Indian gauge rather than the <b>British</b> <b>standard</b> <b>gauge,</b> and were therefore too large. Cammell Laird ordered five dumb barges from Watsons shipyard at Gainsborough, and the tug towed trains of two barges, each loaded with one carriage, down the River Trent.|$|E
5000|$|Collett made {{full use}} of the loading gauge advantage, {{designing}} a basic carriage shape that was 61 ft in length and 9 ft wide—a full 7 in wider than a <b>standard</b> <b>British</b> loading <b>gauge</b> carriage. The result was that the Swindon Works designated [...] "Super Saloons"—which also became known as [...] "Ocean Saloons" [...] and [...] "Cunarders" [...] in service operation—were restricted to the mainline of the GWR that had been originally developed as broad gauge. Hence, each carriage had painted on its end plate:Collett had also designed in a clearance insurance policy, by designing the carriages with a bow-end, allowing him to inset the end doors as well as angling them at 30degrees to the main body.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the rail}} gauge has had {{considerable}} variations, with narrow gauge common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now <b>standard</b> <b>gauge.</b> An important advantage of <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> is that <b>standard</b> railway maintenance equipment {{can be used}} on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives. Additionally, more manufacturers are able to produce <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> vehicles, reducing costs for rolling stock acquisition. Another factor favoring <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout.|$|R
