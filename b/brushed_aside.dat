5|$|Operation Una was {{the only}} {{unsuccessful}} operation by the HV {{from a series of}} offensives which had commenced in November 1994. It was controversial in the Croatian media, but was generally <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> as an aberration from a series of successes. In 2006, Croatian authorities launched an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by HV soldiers during the operation, in which 40 Serb civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{dismissal}} of Constantine was not unanimously {{supported by the}} Entente powers; while France and Britain did nothing to stop Jonnart's actions, the Russian provisional government officially protested to Paris. Petrograd demanded that Alexander should not receive the title of king but only that of regent so as to preserve {{the rights of the}} deposed sovereign and the Crown Prince. Russia's protests were <b>brushed</b> <b>aside,</b> and Alexander ascended the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of its commander, Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković, the mostly ethnic Serb remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia, but were <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> by the 14th Panzer Division as it drove east towards Sarajevo, which fell on 15 April. A ceasefire was agreed on that day, {{and the remains of}} the 4th Army were ordered to stop fighting. The Yugoslav Supreme Command surrendered unconditionally effective on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Commander T'Pol {{takes time}} to rediscover herself {{in the light of}} recent events: the teachings of Surak held in the Kir'Shara; the death of her mother; the {{annulment}} of her marriage; her apparent cure from Pa'nar Syndrome; and her relationship with Commander Tucker. Tucker assists Erickson with the test, but is <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> when he seeks {{to learn more about the}} technology. Following a successful trial-run, which sets a new record for the longest transport ever conducted, Tucker confides in Archer that many of the upgrades and modifications to the ship's power systems were not necessary for the test.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Division <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> 16th Luftwaffe and {{approached}} the outskirts of Caen from the north-east. At 19:15, Meyer and Eberbach authorised {{the withdrawal of the}} 12th SS Panzer Division heavy weapons and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division across the Orne to the southern side of Caen. In the early evening, the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions, as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable. Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and seized a third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had come down from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns {{in the first two}} captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|John Buchan's brigade skirmished {{with the}} French {{defenders}} of Orthez all morning. Having received orders {{to cross the}} Gave de Pau, Hill got his troops marching for the Souars Ford at 11:00 am. Arriving there, the 12,000 Anglo-Portuguese <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> the cavalry regiment and two battalions of the 115th Line Infantry Regiment defending the ford. Hill's troops were soon across the river in strength and pressing back Harispe's outnumbered division. They were joined by Buchan's Portuguese who crossed at the Orthez bridge the moment the town's defenders pulled out. Joined by some newly arrived conscript battalions, Harispe attempted to make a stand at the Motte de Tury heights. The raw recruits proved to be poor fighting material; Hill's men broke Harispe's line and captured three guns.|$|E

5|$|The {{offensive}} was {{the only}} unsuccessful operation undertaken by the HV since Operation Winter '94 in November 1994, and was <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> in Croatia as an aberration. It still remained a subject of controversy in the Croatian media. According to Croatian historian Davor Marijan, the operation was primarily politically motivated and hastily launched in response to Holbrooke's remarks of 17 September. Nonetheless, Marijan claims that the attack was based on incorrect intelligence, leading to an underestimation of the VRS defenses by the HV. In addition, the HV overestimated its own capacity to execute a difficult operation, and neglected {{the condition of the}} rivers that they intended to cross. The HV never attempted to repeat the crossing, instead choosing to threaten Banja Luka from a different direction in early October in Operation Southern Move.|$|E
5|$|When {{drafting}} the Belarus Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies {{were influenced by}} the constitutions of various countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Internally, the Constitution {{was influenced by the}} period of Soviet domination and a desire to bring back traditions <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> by the Soviet Government. The structure of the Constitution is similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Army {{also began}} to {{withdraw}} southwards on 9 April, and on 10 April it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation {{in the face of}} two determined armoured thrusts by the XLVI Motorised Corps, one of which captured Zagreb that evening. Italian offensive operations also began, with thrusts towards Ljubljana and down the Adriatic coast, capturing over 30,000 Yugoslav troops near Delnice. When fifth column elements arrested the staffs of 1st Army Group, 4th Army and 7th Army on 11 April, the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist. On 12 April, a German armoured column linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast, encircling the remnants of the withdrawing 7th Army. Remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia, but were quickly <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> by German armour as it drove towards Sarajevo. The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered on 18 April.|$|E

5|$|In 609BC Necho II went to {{war with}} Babylonia, the Chaldeans, the Medians and the Scythians {{in an attempt to}} save Assyria, which after a brutal civil war was being overrun by this {{coalition}} of powers. However, the attempt to save Egypt's former masters failed. The Egyptians delayed intervening too long, and Nineveh had already fallen and King Sin-shar-ishkun was dead by the time Necho II sent his armies northwards. However, Necho easily <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> the Israelite army under King Josiah but he and the Assyrians then lost a battle at Harran to the Babylonians, Medes and Scythians. Necho II and Ashur-uballit II of Assyria were finally defeated at Carchemish in Aramea (modern Syria) in 605BC. The Egyptians remained in the area for some decades, struggling with the Babylonian kings Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II for control of portions of the former Assyrian Empire in The Levant. However, they were eventually driven back into Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar II even briefly invaded Egypt itself in 567BC. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia (modern Iran), leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.|$|E
5|$|In September 1793 the Sardinian army {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the County of Nice. The French right flank held its ground, but on the left Sérurier gave up the east bank of the Vésubie River and fell back to Utelle on 10 September. Jacques François Dugommier took command of the left wing three days later and Sérurier {{took charge of the}} right wing of the Army of the Alps at Entrevaux. Sérurier was arrested for retreating too much and for being of noble blood. He was reinstated after the representatives on mission and the War Minister Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte termed the charges as unimportant while the citizens of Laon sent a petition vouching for his patriotism. After the fighting petered out in the December snow, Sérurier's division was transferred to form the left flank of the Army of Italy. In January 1794 he was denounced for listening to aristocratic songs and for not caring about desertions, but Bouchotte and the representatives <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> these charges. Under army commander Pierre Jadart Dumerbion a French offensive began on 5 April and Oneglia was seized. André Masséna commanded the 20,000-man main column on the right wing while François Macquard directed the center division and Pierre Dominique Garnier led the left division. Sérurier, who commanded Garnier's left brigade, reoccupied Isola and went on to seize the Colle delle Finestre against weak resistance. In the Second Battle of Saorgio on 24 April 1794, Masséna defeated Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi, the French inflicting 2,800 casualties on the Sardinians while losing 1,500 killed and wounded. In the aftermath, Macquard occupied Saorge and the Col de Tende while Masséna held Ormea in the Tanaro valley. At the end of June, Sérurier took part in a small operation in the Valle Stura di Demonte.|$|E

25|$|On 3 September, Masséna {{attacked}} 1,500 of Vukassovich's troops near Ala {{and drove}} {{them back to}} Marco on the east bank of the Adige.

Vaubois <b>brushed</b> <b>aside</b> some elements of Reuss's brigade at Nago-Torbole and stood poised to attack an Austrian position at Mori on the west bank.
