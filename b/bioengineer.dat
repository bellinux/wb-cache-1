5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to <b>bioengineer</b> bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E
500|$|On May 13, 2005, New Line first {{exercised}} {{their rights}} to use the Friday the 13th moniker when they, along with Avatar comics, released a special issue of Friday the 13th. Written by Brian Pulido and illustrated by Mike Wolfer and Greg Waller, the story takes place after the events of Freddy vs. Jason, where siblings Miles and Laura Upland inherit Camp Crystal Lake. Knowing that Jason caused the recent destruction, Laura, unknown to her brother, sets out to kill Jason with a paramilitary group so {{that she and her}} brother can sell the property. The issue pre‑sold more than 17,500 copies. Avatar released a three-issue miniseries titled Friday the 13th: Bloodbath in September 2005. The series was written by Brian Pulido, illustrated by Mike Wolfer and Andrew Dalhouse, and revolves around a group of teenagers who come to Camp Tomorrow, a camp that sits on Crystal Lake, for work and a [...] "party-filled weekend". The teenagers begin to discover that they share common family backgrounds and soon awaken Jason, who proceeds to kill them. Brian Pulido returned for a third time in October 2005 to write another special issue for Avatar, titled Jason X. Picking up after the events of the Jason X film, Jason is now on Earth 2 where a <b>bioengineer,</b> Kristen, attempts to subdue him in hopes that she can use his regenerative tissue to save her own life and the lives of those she loves. In February 2006, Avatar published their final Friday the 13th comic, a two-issue miniseries titled Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X. The series was written and illustrated by Mike Wolfer. The story takes place after the events of the film Jason X, where a salvage team discovers the spaceship Grendel and awakens a regenerated Jason Voorhees. The [...] "original" [...] Jason and Über-Jason, a version of Jason with mechanical limbs, are drawn into a battle to the death. In June 2006, a one-shot comic titled Friday the 13th: Fearbook was released, written by Mike Wolfer with art by Sebastian Fiumara. In the comic, Jason is captured and experimented upon by the Trent Organization. Jason escapes and seeks out Violet, the survivor of Friday the 13th: Bloodbath, whom the Trent Organization is holding in their Crystal Lake headquarters.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{combines the}} principles of medical, life science, and engineering fields toward the development of biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of bioengineering smooth muscle tissue in vitro; however the contractile properties of <b>bioengineered</b> smooth muscle tissue have not been evaluated. It is imperative that <b>bioengineered</b> tissues have {{a high degree of}} functional testing in order to evaluate tissue-specific function as well as suitability for future clinical applications. This research describes the development and functional testing of novel 3 -dimensional <b>bioengineered</b> smooth muscle tissues in vitro {{and the development of a}} micro-perfusion system to support culture and enhance functionality of <b>bioengineered</b> tissues. All <b>bioengineered</b> tissue models described here were developed utilizing a fibrin biomaterial, which is well-suited for bioengineering contractile tissues. We developed ring-shaped models of rat sphincter and colonic smooth muscle tissue as well as a strip model of human aortic vascular smooth muscle tissue. Functional testing of the contractile properties of <b>bioengineered</b> muscle tissues was accomplished using a custom build force transducer. <b>Bioengineered</b> tissues exhibited striking tissue-specific functionality, which was similar to smooth muscle in vivo, including the generation of spontaneous basal tone and agonist-induced contraction and relaxation, which was calcium-dependent and calcium-independent (respectively). Finally, in order to support the increased metabolic demands of <b>bioengineered</b> tissues, we designed and fabricated a novel micro-perfusion system to promote delivery of a constant supply of oxygenated media to <b>bioengineered</b> tissues. We tested the compatibility of our micro-perfusion system with <b>Bioengineered</b> Heart Muscle (BEHM) and found that the system is capable of supporting viability (mitochondrial activity, total protein, total RNA) and maintaining contractile properties (twitch force, specific force, electrical pacing, and expression of contractile proteins) of <b>bioengineered</b> tissues. In addition, short-term exposure of BEHMs to micro-perfusion resulted in some functional improvement. This research specifically adds to the knowledge base of two critical areas in tissue engineering research: 1) the development of functional <b>bioengineered</b> models, and 2) ancillary technology to support these models.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study assesses in a baboon {{model the}} {{hemodynamics}} and {{human leukocyte antigen}} immunogenicity of chronically implanted <b>bioengineered</b> (decellularized with collagen conditioning treatments) human and baboon heart valve scaffolds. MethodsFourteen baboons underwent pulmonary valve replacement, 8 with decellularized and conditioned (<b>bioengineered)</b> pulmonary valves derived from allogeneic (N =  3) or xenogeneic (human) (N =  5) hearts; for comparison, 6 baboons received clinically relevant reference cryopreserved or porcine valved conduits. Panel-reactive serum antibodies (human leukocyte antigen class I and II), complement fixing antibodies (C 1 q binding), and C-reactive protein titers were measured serially until elective sacrifice at 10 or 26 weeks. Serial transesophageal echocardiograms measured valve function and geometry. Differences were analyzed with Kruskal–Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. ResultsAll animals survived and thrived, exhibiting excellent immediate implanted valve function by transesophageal echocardiograms. Over time, reference valves developed a smaller effective orifice area index (median, 0. 84 cm 2 /m 2; range, 1. 22 cm 2 /m 2), whereas all <b>bioengineered</b> valves remained normal (effective orifice area index median, 2. 45 cm 2 /m 2; range, 1. 35 cm 2 /m 2; P = . 005).

The belief that adverse human health effects can result from consuming <b>bioengineered</b> foods has prompted consumer groups to urge mandatory labeling of foods containing <b>bioengineered</b> ingredients. This report reviews the potential adverse health effects of <b>bioengineered</b> foods, and implications for labeling are addressed. Data Sources.

In our previous studies using rats, it was demonstrated that tracheal fibroblasts accelerated proliferation and differentiation of the tracheal epithelium in vitro and in vivo. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of fibroblasts on epithelial regeneration in larger tracheal defects in rabbits. Methods: We developed a <b>bioengineered</b> scaffold, the luminal surface of which was coated with fibroblasts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Currently, {{acellular}} dermal substitutes {{used for}} skin reconstruction are usually covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The {{goal of this}} study was to develop an animal model in which such dermal substitutes can be tested under standardized conditions using a <b>bioengineered</b> dermo-epidermal skin graft for coverage. METHODS: <b>Bioengineered</b> grafts consisting of collagen type I hydrogels with incorporated human fibroblasts and human keratinocytes seeded on these gels were produced. Two different dermal substitutes, namely Matriderm(®), and an acellular collagen type I hydrogel, were applied onto full-thickness skin wounds created on the back of immuno-incompetent rats. As control, no dermal substitute was used. As coverage for the dermal substitutes either the <b>bioengineered</b> grafts were used, or, as controls, human split-thickness skin or neonatal rat epidermis were used. Grafts were excised 21  days post-transplantation. Histology and immunofluorescence was performed to investigate survival, epidermis formation, and vascularization of the grafts. RESULTS: The <b>bioengineered</b> grafts survived on all tested dermal substitutes. Epidermis formation and vascularization were comparable to the controls. CONCLUSION: We could successfully use human <b>bioengineered</b> grafts to test different dermal substitutes.
