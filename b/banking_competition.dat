Our data source is a new, richer and updated dataset The Global Financial Development Database available at World Bank. Due to the specifics of this dataset we are able to use new combinations of measures of financial stability and of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and to study their relationship in greater depth. We find a positive link between financial stability and <b>bank</b> <b>competition.</b> Furthermore, our results provide evidence that it matters what measures of financial stability and <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> we apply. Lastly, we ascertain that the relationship between financial stability and <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> does not change over time.

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} {{debate on the}} effects of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> on economic welfare and growth, only a handful of single-country studies deal with the impact of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> on the cost of credit. We contribute to the literature by investigating the impact of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> on the cost of credit in a cross-country setting. Using a panel of firms from 20 European countries covering the period 2001 – 2011, we consider a broad set of measures of <b>bank</b> <b>competition,</b> including two structural measures (Herfindahl-Hirschman index and CR 5), and two non-structural indicators (Lerner index and H-statistic). We find that <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> increases the cost of credit and observe that the positive influence of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> is stronger for smaller companies. Our findings accord with the information hypothesis, whereby a lack of <b>competition</b> incentivizes <b>banks</b> to invest in soft information and conversely increased competition raises the cost of credit. This positive impact of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> is however influenced by the institutional and economic framework, {{as well as by the}} crisis...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} recent EU-wide {{movements in}} <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and concentration. We {{start with a}} concise overview {{of the most frequently}} used competition and concentration measures. Given that different measures may capture different aspects of <b>bank</b> <b>competition,</b> we focus on the differences and similarities between concentration and competition measures for a broad sample of EU banks. We show that a high level of bank concentration does not necessarily imply a low level of competition and that competition measures such as the Boone indicator (Boone, The Economic Journal, 118 (531), 1245 – 1261, 2008) and the H-statistic (Panzar and Rosse, The Journal of Industrial Economics, 35 (4), 443 – 456, 1987) might capture different aspects of <b>bank</b> <b>competition.</b> Next, we discuss the evolution of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> in the EU over time. We end with an overview of recent findings on three important issues concerning bank competition: the impact of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> on <b>bank</b> risk-taking, the relationship between <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and systemic risk and the relationship between <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and switching costs for bank customers...|$|R

40|$|We {{exploit the}} {{deregulation}} of interstate bank branching laws {{to test whether}} <b>banking</b> <b>competition</b> affects innovation.

Innovation increases among private firms that are dependent on external finance and that have limited access to credit from local banks. We argue that <b>banking</b> <b>competition</b> enables small, innovative firms to secure financing instead of being acquired by public corporations. Therefore, <b>banking</b> <b>competition</b> reduces the supply of innovative targets, which reduces the portion of state-level innovation attributable to public corporations.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> in Russia by {{measuring}} the market power of Russian banks and its determinants over the period 2001 - 2007 with the Lerner index. Earlier studies on <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> have focused on developed countries whereas this paper contributes to the analysis of <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> in emerging markets. We find that <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> has only slightly improved during the period studied. The mean Lerner index for Russian banks is of the same magnitude as those observed in developed countries, which suggests that the Russian banking industry is not plagued by weak competition. Furthermore, we find no greater market power for state-controlled banks nor less market power for foreign-owned banks. We would consequently qualify the procompetitive role of foreign bank entry and privatization. Finally, our analysis of the determinants of market power enables the identification of several factors that influence competition, including market concentration and risk as well as t the nonlinear influence of size.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of eight chapters investigating {{the relationship between}} <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and capital allocation. Following the introduction (chapter 1), the second chapter provides {{a review of the}} literature. The third chapter extends a seminal contribution in the <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> literature, the model developed by Broecker (1990). In chapter 4 I show that an auction framework may be an inappropriate way of modeling <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and I explore the implications of modeling <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> in a more robust fashion for the allocation of capital. The fifth chapter aims to resolve a long-standing discrepancy between the empirical and theoretical literatures on <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> and capital allocation. While theoretical work tends to see few benefits from more intense competition, the evidence suggests that the allocation of capital improves as <b>bank</b> <b>competition</b> becomes more intense. The theoretical model developed in chapter 5 reconciles these results by modeling banks' objective function in a way consistent with empirical evidence on X-inefficiency in banks. Chapters 6 and 7 investigate the transmission mechanism through which a greater intensity of competition is transmitted within banks and study lending-related incentive structures through interview-based fieldwork. Chapter 6 provides motivation and outlines the scope of the study whereas the actual findings are presented in chapter 7. That chapter also analyzes the implications for the lending and monitoring decisions that co-determine the allocation of capital. Chapter 8 concludes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how <b>banking</b> <b>competition</b> affects {{the transmission of}} monetary policy through the bank lending channel.

This is especially true for banks in Latin American countries and banks of small size, low liquidity, and low capitalization.
