40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>growth</b> is a {{relatively}} new policy of EU enhancing sustainable use of the sea resources. The relation between <b>blue</b> <b>growth</b> and maritime spatial planning (MSP) are not obvious. Both belong to a class of EU policies and both cover the sea space. Since maritime spatial planning in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has recently gained its momentum, the maritime spatial planners face the challenge of incorporating the concept of the <b>blue</b> <b>growth</b> into their planning processes. This paper facilitates this task by providing a comprehensive information on the international projects executed by the maritime spatial planners and the relations of those projects to the concept of the <b>blue</b> <b>growth.</b> This is important in order to capitalize on what has been achieved so far. However, it seems that has been so far no single “planning project” focusing exclusively on the <b>blue</b> <b>growth</b> and this growth has been tackled in such projects rather at ad hoc and non-systematic manner. Thus, the research on relations between MSP and <b>blue</b> <b>growth</b> seems to be still pending.

At the European level there is strong political pressure to enhance the growth of maritime economy sectors.

The purpose is to make a relatively short introduction to questions like what is the potential of sustainable <b>Blue</b> <b>Growth,</b> how can maritime spatial planning (MSP) contribute to sustainable <b>Blue</b> <b>Growth,</b> and what are the cross-border elements of MSP. The experiences of previous MSP projects, EU policy reports and scientific articles with MSP in their focus are used as a source to answer these questions.
