60|$|For a week Columbine rolled about, {{and then}} one morning faint blue lines ran across the sea to the north. Gasping and {{sweating}} with the effort, they hoisted sail and sent up the biggest topsail drenched with salt water. Sometimes it and the light <b>balloon</b> <b>jib</b> filled and although the lower canvas would not draw, Columbine began to move. One could not feel her progress, there was no strain on the helm, but silky ripples left her side and slowly trailed astern.|$|E
60|$|At length, he felt {{an elusive}} chill, and wiping his wet face, looked about. In the east, it was not quite so dark, and when {{he turned his head}} the yacht looked blacker and not so large. Hull and sails were no longer blurred; their outline was getting sharp, and he noted that the <b>balloon</b> <b>jib</b> swelled in a gentle curve. One side of his face got cold and when he began to scull again he thought the strain on the rope was less.|$|E
60|$|Columbine rolled {{heavily on}} the broken swell and the lamp that swung from a beam threw a puzzling light about the cabin. Now and then water splashed on the deck and the slack sails flapped. The fresh breeze had dropped, {{although}} the sea had not yet gone down, and Marston had set the topsail and the <b>balloon</b> <b>jib.</b> The light canvas would chafe and was not of much use, but he must reach Kingston as soon as possible. He was exhausted by physical effort and anxious watching, and when Rupert replaced the bandage on his comrade's face he leaned back slackly on the locker seat.|$|E
40|$|Common {{shrimp trawl}} designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, <b>balloon,</b> semiballoon, <b>jib,</b> and super X- 3. Recent innovations in trawl design and rigging, including the twin trawl rigging and tongue trawl design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and vertical opening for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, <b>jib,</b> <b>balloon,</b> and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue trawl designs.

50|$|The {{end of the}} {{selection}} round robins series found Kookaburra III the leading yacht, with 83 points, followed by Australia IV at 77 and Kookaburra II at 70. Steak and Kidney was eliminated on points halfway through the final round. With ongoing protests over the legality of Australia IVs <b>balloon</b> <b>jib,</b> an agreement was reached in which Australia IV and Kookaburra III would race in a best of nine set. The winning syndicate could then use Kookaburra II as the defender yacht if they so chose.|$|E
5000|$|Launched on July 10, 1902, Thomas W. Lawson was 475 ft overall, 395 feet (120.4 m) on deck, and {{contained}} seven masts of equal height (193 feet (58.8 m)) which carried 25 sails (seven gaff sails, seven gaff topsails, six topmast staysails and five jib sails (fore staysail, jib, flying jib, jib topsail, <b>balloon</b> <b>jib)</b> encompassing 43,000 square feet (4,000 mÂ²)) of canvas. Originally painted white the ships hull appeared in black later on. The naming of her masts {{was always a}} subject for some discussion (see external link [...] "The Masts of the Thomas W. Lawson"). In the original sail plan and during construction named (fore to aft): no. 1 to no. 7, no. 7 being replaced by [...] "spanker mast" [...] later on. The names of the masts changed then to: fore, main, mizzen, spanker, jigger, driver, and pusher at launch and to: forecastle, fore, main, mizzen, jigger, and spanker after launch. Later {{on a lot of}} different naming systems were formed, e.g. fore, main, mizzen, rusher, driver, jigger, and spanker or fore, main, mizzen, no. 4, no. 5, no. 6, and no. 7, the naming preferred by the crew (which incorporated a possible misunderstanding between [...] "fore" [...] meaning [...] "foremast" [...] and [...] "mast no. four"). Even a naming after the days of the week was discussed with the foremast being named [...] "Sunday" [...] and the spankermast [...] "Saturday".|$|E
