5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|Although the University Council is the {{principal}} executive and policy-making body of the university, it must report and <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> to the Regent House {{through a variety of}} checks and balances.

500|$|During {{the first}} part of Brownlee's premiership, the {{presidency}} of the UFA was still held by his old friend and ally Henry Wise Wood. [...] Wood's considerable influence helped hold in check the organization's more radical elements, who were generally antagonistic to the cautious and conservative Brownlee. [...] Even so, Foster and Byrne suggest that towards the beginning of Brownlee's term, he started to replace Wood as the [...] "centre" [...] of the UFA in a way that Greenfield had not. [...] Despite this, his relationship with the UFA grassroots was sometimes stormy. [...] The 1929 UFA convention saw vocal criticisms of Brownlee's failure to adopt the old age pension and his decision to withdraw the Debt Adjustment Act in the face of opposition from banks. [...] He also rejected the notion, dear to many UFA members, that a UFA government should be bound by the resolutions of the UFA membership. [...] He felt that the heated atmosphere of UFA conventions did not lend itself to the development of prudent policy, and that the government of Alberta ought to <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> not only to UFA members but to the population at large.|$|E
