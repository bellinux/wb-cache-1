2500|$|Liepāja {{enjoys a}} semi-continental climate noted as [...] "Dfb" [...] in the Köppen classification. The major factor {{influencing}} {{the weather in}} the region is the Baltic Sea, providing a relatively mild winter for its high latitude (although snowy) and a relatively cool summer. During the winter the sea around Liepāja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some land-fast ice may develop, it seldom reaches a hundred meters from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea warms up fully only in the beginning of August, so the best <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> in Liepāja is from August to September. Summers are more affected by the martime climate than east-facing cities on similar latitudes in opposite Sweden, but winters are milder than inland areas to the east. Regular meteorological observations in the city have been conducted from 1857.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Morecambe´s three {{designated}} bathing waters {{to pass the}} EU Directive on Bathing Water Quality depends {{on the time of}} day when the sample is taken, the indicator organism tested for and whether the test uses the most strict (Guideline) or the least strict (Imperative) criteria. Morning and afternoon sampling for faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and the pathogen Campylobacter was carried out monthly over the 1996 and 1997 <b>bathing</b> <b>seasons.</b> In the afternoons average faecal coliforms declined by 77 % in 1996 and 87 % in 1997 compared with the mornings, faecal streptococci by 79 % and 83 % and campylobacters by 66 % and 86 %. This decline in bacterial numbers between morning and afternoon was related to variations in water temperature and levels of ultraviolet radiation. All three bathing waters failed the Guideline criteria of the EU Directive on Bathing Water Quality. Using the Imperative criteria, no bathing waters passed in the mornings of either year, some passed in the afternoons of 1996 and all passed in the afternoons of 1997. The increased pass rate in 1997 coincided with improved sewage treatment, high temperatures and increased levels of sunshine. In 1997 sampling by the Environment Agency produced fewer failures than our morning sampling but more than our afternoon sampling. Their sampling was done around midday. It is suggested that where possible all sampling of EU designated bathing waters should be carried out in the early mornin...|$|R
40|$|It is of interest, both {{environmentally}} and economically, for {{the water}} quality at beaches to be maintained and improved wherever possible. In 2006 a new European Community Directive was introduced which set compliance standards in terms of percentile values of different microbial indicators and, provided the public has been informed of the water quality via electronic message signs, permits samples to be discounted from compliance calculations. Consequently, the initial research question posed concerned {{the definition of a}} single sample limit (SSL) which could be used to determine the quality of a single sample of bathing water, whether or not it could be discounted and whether or not this could be set generically. The focus of the work later changed to become the definition of discounting limits {{that could be used to}} identify the samples which should be removed from the dataset on which compliance with the 2006 Directive is based. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the general context of the problem, a description of the data and gives details of how compliance is assessed. In Chapter 2 exploratory analysis of the data revealed extensive variation in each of the microbiological indicators considered, both across the bathing water sites and within the same site across different <b>bathing</b> <b>seasons.</b> The distribution of each of two microbial indicators, faecal streptoccoci (FS) and faecal coliforms (FC) was considered and other features of the data including multiple outliers and evidence of bimodality were also apparent at some locations. All of this indicated that the definition of a generic single sample limit would not be achievable. The assumption of log-normality, on which the calculation of percentiles used to assess compliance with the Directive is based, was also investigated. Chapter 3 then used the level of compliance achieved in 2007 (using the data from <b>bathing</b> <b>seasons</b> in 2004 - 2007) as a measure of outcome in order to assess the effectiveness of several different candidate definitions of a single sample limit, including two site independent values and one formulaic approach. Following on from the issues discovered in the initial exploratory analysis of the data and after discussion with SEPA a generic SSL did not seem feasible and hence the stated objective of the work was modified to identifying a discounting limit which could be used to identify samples that could potentially be removed from compliance calculations. Therefore from Chapter 4 onwards only discounting limits are considered and the idea of using extreme value models became the basis of the remaining chapters. Chapter 4 considers the use of extreme value theory, in particular block maxima, k-th largest order statistic and threshold models to identify suitable return levels which could be applied as discounting limits across all sites. The differences between the return level limits obtained from each of the models, their impact on the levels of compliance classification when all counts exceeding the limits were removed and the inclusion of a relevant covariate within the block maxima model were also considered here. Chapter 5 focused on site specific threshold models, in particular, for the locations where electronic message signs are currently in place. The quantity of data removed at each site and the robustness of the discounting limits found using these models was also examined here. Finally, Chapter 6 provides a summary of the findings and discusses limitations of the study and possible future directions...|$|R

I have had several careers since I began this routine of life and death. I have been an archbishop three times. When I persuaded the authorities to knock down all our towns and rebuild them from the foundations, or move them, I went into the artillery, and became a general. I have been President.|$|E
60|$|The villa residences to {{the east}} of Sandgate Castle, you must understand, are {{particularly}} lucky in having gardens that run right down to the beach. There is no intervening esplanade or road or path such as cuts off ninety-nine out of the hundred of houses that face the sea. As you look down on them from the western end of the Leas, you see them crowding the very margin. And as a great number of high groins stand out from the shore along this piece of coast, the beach is practically cut off and made private except at very low water, when people can get around the ends of the groins. These houses are consequently highly desirable during the <b>bathing</b> <b>season,</b> and it is the custom of many of their occupiers to let them furnished during the summer to persons of fashion and affluence.|$|E
60|$|She {{suggested}} {{this theory}} to Ewbert, and he denied it with blithe derision, {{but she said}} that he need not tell her, and in confirming herself in it she began to relax her belief that old Ransom Hilbrook had preyed upon him. She {{even went so far}} as to say that the only intellectual companionship he had ever had in the place was that which he found in the old man's society. When she discovered, after the fact, that Ewbert had written to him since they came away, she was not so severe with him as she might have expected herself to be in view of an act which, if not quite clandestine, was certainly without her privity. She would have considered him fitly punished by Hilbrook's failure to reply, if she had not shared his uneasiness at the old man's silence. But she did not allow this to affect her good spirits, which were essential to her husband's comfort as well as her own. She redoubled her care of him in every sort, and among all the ladies who admired her devotion to him there was none who enjoyed it as much as herself. There was none who believed more implicitly that it was owing to her foresight and oversight that his health mended so rapidly, and that at the end of the <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> she was, as she said, taking him home quite another man. In her perfect satisfaction she suffered him his small joke about not feeling it quite right to go with her if that were so; and though a woman of little humor, she even professed to find pleasure in his joke after she fully understood it.|$|E

50|$|Passenger numbers grew {{steadily}} until World War I with {{a record}} 56.3 million in 1919, but they collapsed due to the economic conditions {{after the war and}} the hyperinflation in 1923/24 to only 21 million. By 1925, patronage recovered and reached a level of about 40 million passengers annually. The economic recovery after 1924 made possible the expansion of its network to neighbouring towns like Knielingen (1925), Daxlanden (1928) and Rintheim (1929). Also in 1929, the newly opened outdoor swimming pool of Rheinstrandbad on the island of Rappenwört was connected to Karlsruhe. This line operated until 1997, but, {{due to the lack of}} housing on the line, only during the summer <b>bathing</b> <b>season.</b> The Great Depression made further route expansion in those years impossible.

50|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th century Manly {{was one of}} Australia's most popular seaside holiday resorts. Manly Beach {{is said to be}} the place where the {{restriction}} on daylight sea bathing was first challenged in Australia. In October 1902 William Gocher, clad in a neck to knee costume, swam at midday after announcing his intention to do so in the newspaper he had established (Manly and North Sydney News). After being ignored by authorities and being publicly critical of them, he swam again and was escorted from the water by the police, although no charges were laid. In November 1903, Manly Council resolved to allow all-day bathing provided a neck to knee swimming costume was worn.During the first official <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> in 1903, 17 people drowned on Manly Beach. A year later a surf club was formed on the beach to safeguard the public. While there is debate about which club is the oldest, Manly Life Saving Club is one of the world's first surf life saving clubs.|$|E
5000|$|Øresund is {{a shallow}} strait which allows rather fast {{temperature}} rises, when air temperatures permits. Possible <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> is between mid-May and mid-September. However, to reach fairly good bathing temperatures (of at least 18 °C or higher) (64.4 F)in the afternoons, air temperature {{needs to be}} above 25 °C (77 F) {{for about a week}} in May, while just a few days of heat is enough in August. During longer heat waves, water temperatures often rise above 22 °C (71.6 F) during the period of late June until early September. The water quality is usually very good. All local outlets to Øresund has been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected since the 1970s (this applies to the Swedish part of Øresund as well). Water salinity is highly dependent on the current. With northbound current (from the Baltic Sea) salinity may drop down a bit below 10 PSU (1.0% by weight), but with southbound current (from Cattegat) salinity rises to above 25 PCU, not so far from the northern Atlantic salinity of 30-33 PCU. (Eastbound and westbound currents cannot occur in Øresund, with very local exceptions only. The daily tides are not notable, but irregular, weather-dependent water level differences do exist. During the winter ice problems are very rare.) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1793, {{following}} {{the foundation of}} Germany's first seaside resort in Heiligendamm, the Duke of Mecklenburg, Frederick Francis I, pressed ahead {{with the development of}} Doberan (the name was changed to Bad Doberan in the 1920s) as his ducal summer residence. As well as being the residence of the Duke and his court, Doberan also became the meeting place for the social elite of the state. Whilst Heiligendamm attracted visitors with its bathing establishments, Doberan drew them mainly with its variety of amusements and social events. But the town need to be further developed. The triangular cow pasture situated in front of the Logierhaus was fenced off with barriers, footpaths were laid and it was turned into a park. Thus, the Kamp became the centre of Doberan. A restaurateur from Milan, Gaetano Medini, offered food in a tent, and concerts by the Duke's orchestra were held here. The Kamp was festively illuminated during the <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> and there were firework displays. Since the original thatched houses of Doberan's villagers were not in keeping with the image of a ducal summer residence, the Duke forbade their construction and paid subsidies for the construction of tiled houses. With the engagement of Carl Theodor Severin, an architect, in 1802, several prestigious buildings were erected around the Kamp, including a theatre, the Logierhaus, a palace and a salon building (Salongebäude).|$|E
40|$|Good {{quality of}} bathing water is an {{increasingly}} important factor taken into account when we choose summer vacations, {{a place to stay}} for a weekend or a weekend trip destination. In the Czech Republic, bathing waters may be divided according to the legal status into outdoor swimming pools, surface waters used for bathing (swimming areas), other water surfaces or artificial pools. In my thesis I dealt only with outdoor swimming pools and swimming areas. The difference between them {{lies in the fact that}} outdoor swimming pools have their own operators who monitor water quality and provide other services in the waterside. Usually there is a fee charged. Swimming areas have no operators and water quality monitoring is placed under the responsibility of regional public health authorities. In the Czech Republic, at present, 188 outdoor swimming pools and swimming areas have been monitored on a regular basis each <b>bathing</b> <b>season.</b> For my research I chose four sites located in the South Bohemian region and four sites in the South Moravian region. For each of these eight sites, I collected results of laboratory analyses, including categories of water quality in bathing seasons of the past five years, it means from the year 2005. With these obtained data I assessed the water quality development both during the <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> of 2009 and its evolution over the past five years. On the basis of particular categories of water quality I also tried to compare water quality in the South Bohemian and the South Moravian region and also to compare water quality between individual sampling points in one locality. Another aim was to evaluate some measures and interventions made in order to improve water quality. I focused particularly on the pond Olšovec in the South Moravian region and the VN (water reservoir) Orlík in the South Bohemian region. The results do not show any prominent changes in water quality both during the <b>bathing</b> <b>season</b> 2009 and over the past five years. Pronounced fluctuations in water quality were recorded only at certain locations during the 2007 <b>bathing</b> <b>season.</b> Not even between individual regions significant differences in water quality were found. The proportion of individual water quality categories in the two regions did not differ by more than 4 %. We can therefore say that water quality in selected localities in the South Bohemian and South Moravian regions is comparable. As for certain measures and interventions implemented to improve water quality, it is important to focus also on the wider neighborhood of the locality, because it could also be a source of substances worsening water quality...|$|E
