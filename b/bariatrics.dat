Weight reduction trainings are organized by many companies all over the Czech Republic. Training leading specialists arrange them as individual or collective according to customers needs. The actual content of the trainings is always dependent on lector leading the training. Commercial weight reduction fabrics can be divided into three groups: tee, pills and drinks.

The next part of the work is focused on obesity as it is and on <b>bariatrics.</b> Obesity therapy includes low energetic diet with food fat restriction, motion activity (with prevailing aerobic character), cognitive [...] behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy or surgical intervention in individual cases. The methodology part contains evaluation of a series of surveys. Their Data were collected by a standardized questionnaire for two groups of respondents.

40|$|There is a {{noticeable}} {{increase in the}} number of bariatric admissions to healthcare facilities. This trend presents a challenge to healthcare providers and facilities striving to provide dignified care that is effective and safe both for the patient and the provider. Many bariatric patients, due to their size and difficulty with mobility, require assistance with numerous activities of daily living. The more mobility-dependent the patient is, the greater the risk for injury for those providing the care. The additional myriad of bariatric patients ' co-morbidities makes these patients especially vulnerable for health complications during their hospital stay. The authors of this article provide definitions related to <b>bariatrics</b> and describe specific health concerns of bariatric patients. They also discuss the risks of injury for providers caring for bariatric patients, explain the components of a bariatric safe patient handling program, and conclude with a discussion of current issues related to the care of bariatric patients...|$|E
