5|$|Through 1935, as the <b>breakup</b> {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation {{through the}} courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the <b>breakup,</b> Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the <b>breakup</b> clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the <b>breakup</b> to take place within three years.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses new firm-level data {{to examine}} the effects of <b>breakups</b> of the Czech firms and their {{subsequent}} privatization on corporate performance. Unlike the existing literature, which analyzes <b>breakups</b> almost exclusively in advanced economies, we control for accompanying ownership changes and the fact that spinoffs and ownership are endogenous variables. We find that <b>breakups</b> increase the firm's profitability but do not alter its scale of operations, while the effect of privatization depends on the resulting ownership structure - sometime improving performance and sometime bringing about decline. The effects of privatization are hence less clear-cut than suggested in earlier studies. Methodologically, our study provides evidence that it is important to control for changes in ownership when analyzing divestitures and control for endogeneity, selection and data attrition when analyzing the effects of <b>breakups</b> and privatization. privatization, <b>breakups,</b> corporate performance, endogeneity, firms? division...|$|R

It is found that the estimated values of the correlation dimension tend to drop at auroral <b>breakups.</b> This is developed into the detection of auroral <b>breakups.</b> At first, using the data that is easy to detect visually auroral <b>breakups</b> by the waveform, the training data is expressed with the pair of the estimates of the correlation dimension and the label which codes as + 1 for auroral <b>breakups</b> and − 1 for non-auroral <b>breakups.</b> Next, we construct the discriminant function by the support vector machine using the training data. Using the training data, the error for the discrimination is computed. The error is found to be 11. 3 %. This suggests the usefulness of the estimates of the correlation dimension in the discrimination...|$|R
