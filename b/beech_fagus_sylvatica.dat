5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica),</b> and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests, and tend {{to appear in the}} summer and autumn. In Spain, it is common in dune pine forests. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides. Widely distributed, Russula densifolia is known from Asia (including China, India, Japan, and Thailand), Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Russula virescens can {{be found}} fruiting on soil in both {{deciduous}} forests and mixed forests, forming ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships {{with a variety of}} trees, including oaks (Quercus), European <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica),</b> and aspen (Populus tremula). Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of Dipterocarpaceae, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of Southeast Asia. Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups, reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn. A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in subtropical forests in Xalapa showed that the fruiting period of R.virescens occurred in April, before the onset of the rainy season.|$|E
5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} in 1966 and {{is considered one of}} the most important protected areas for the maintenance of mountainous biodiversity and ecosystem integrity at the national level. Forests of European black pine (Pinus nigra) and common <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica)</b> cover the park's lower and middle altitudes , with several of these trees being more than 700 years old. At higher altitudes , Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) woodland is dominant, while at the greatest heights , only certain types of bushes are found in the treeless alpine meadows. Additionally, the dry places and the lower parts of the valley are characterized by the domination of Buxus sempervirens, while some individuals of Abies borisii-regis are scattered among the Pinus nigra and Fagus sylvatica forests.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{it grows}} in {{deciduous}} woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, {{but is also}} found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from treeless heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (Betula pubescens), silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely European <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica).</b> No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region. Brandrud reported that {{what he described as}} spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), as well as the buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Betula pubescens in Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut (Corylus avellana) in Central and Southern Europe.|$|E

50|$|At {{elevations}} up to 1,500-1,700 meters, {{there are}} extensive forests of <b>beeches</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica),</b> Abies alba, pines (Pinus sylvestris), oaks (Quercus subpyrenaica), and {{a lesser extent}} of birches (Betula pendula), ashes (Fraxinus excelsior), willows (Salix angustifolia). At higher elevations up to 2,000 m, the mountain pine (Pinus uncinata) dominates. Up to 1,800 m, bushes of boxwood (Buxus sempervirens) are found. In the high meadows from 1,700 to 3,000 meters, there are numerous endemisms including Borderea pyrenaica, Campanula cochleariifolia, Ramonda myconi, Silene borderei, Androsace cylindrica, Pinguicula longifolia, Petrocoptis crassifolia, etc. The Edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum), {{is one of the}} symbols of the National Park.|$|R

Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula) A {{wide range of}} animals are found, including fallow deer (Dama dama), muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and European adder (Vipera berus).|$|E
25|$|The area {{consists}} {{of a series of}} vegetation zones going from the sand communities of the coastline towards the forests of the mainland. The forest includes <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica),</b> birch (Betula pubescens), alder (Alnus glutinosa), pine and oak.

25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} eat a {{range of}} foods, such as tree bark, tree buds, berries, many types of seeds and acorns, walnuts, and other nuts, and some types of fungi found in the forests, including fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria). They can cause damage to trees by tearing the bark and eating the soft cambial tissue underneath. In Europe, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica</b> L.) suffer the greatest damage.|$|E

25|$|<b>Beech</b> forests (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica)</b> {{are found}} in the {{mountain}} layer of the Iberian Eurosiberian region from 800 to 1500 metres up. The soil is cool, as often chalky as siliceous (rich in silica), and nearly always acidified by rain. The layer is characterised by the beech tree. The beech tree projects a deep shadow, and so its dense foliage usually excludes other woodland species. It therefore has little undergrowth.|$|R
25|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} cover 70% of the park's territory. The lowest zones (800â€“1500m) are {{occupied with}} beech forests consisting primarily of European <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica),</b> riparian deciduous forests dominated by grey alder (Alnus incana) and mixed forests of beech, common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia). Above these ecosystems are located xerothermic oak forests, {{dominated by the}} local endemic Rila oak (Quercus protoroburoides) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea), whose upper zones are covered by European beech, European silver fir (Abies alba) and Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis). Coniferous ecosystems occupy altitudes between 1300 and 2200m and consist of Norway spruce (Picea abies), Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and firs. Secondary ecosystems that replace primeval forests cover 5% of the park consist mainly of common aspen (Populus tremula), silver birch (Betula pendula) and common hazel (Corylus avellana) replacing spruce and pine forests.|$|E
500|$|Growing on the ground, Gomphus clavatus {{mushrooms}} appear singly, {{in clusters}} or clumps, or even occasionally fairy rings.

It is equally common in older or younger stands of trees. Fruit bodies are easily missed because their colors blend {{with those of the}} forest floor. It is more common at elevations of greater than [...] Gomphus clavatus has been reported as forming symbiotic (mycorrhizal) associations with a variety of trees: Abies alba, Abies cephalonica, Abies firma, Abies nephrolepis, Abies religiosa, Picea species, Pinus densiflora, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Tsuga heterophylla.

40|$|By {{reviewing}} all {{published and}} unpublished data, the present status of Nyctalus lasiopterus in Hungary was assessed. The species is known from 12 localities in the country, mostly {{situated in the}} North Hungarian Mountains. Only one stable population is known, which {{is located in the}} MÃ¡tra Mountains and has been present each summer since its discovery in 1995.

Radio-tracking resulted in the finding of 13 roosting trees, which were exclusively <b>beeches</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>sylvatica)</b> in a montane beech forest. The largest roosting group consisted of more than 50 individuals. Sex ratio was highly female biased; adult males have rarely been found in the country. Lactating females and juveniles were captured regularly, which indicates the presence of a stable nursing population in the country. In Hungary, the main threat to N. lasiopterus {{is likely to be the}} logging of old beech forests.
