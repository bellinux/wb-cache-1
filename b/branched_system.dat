50|$|The {{breathing}} of all vertebrates with lungs (which are {{by definition}} inside their bodies) consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly <b>branched</b> <b>system</b> of tubes or airways which {{lead from the}} nose to the alveoli. The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate, {{and is one of}} the four primary vital signs of life. Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostats which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). Over-breathing (hyperventilation) and under-breathing (hypoventilation), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. Both cause distressing symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Whistling {{behavior}} of two geometrically periodic systems are investigated: corrugated pipes and a multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system.</b> In both systems frequency (Helmholtz number) is a non-decreasing piecewise constant {{function of the}} Mach number, whose increase on average is approximately linear. The plateaus, lock-in frequencies, of this piecewise constant function correspond to the longitudinal acoustic pipe modes. In both systems pressure fluctuation amplitude changes non-monotonically with Mach number with local maxima that correspond to the lock-in frequencies. A characteristic length, equal to cavity width plus upstream edge radius, yields the smallest discrepancy in the measured peak whistling Strouhal number for both corrugated pipes and multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system.</b> For both systems the upstream edge radius of the cavity has a strong effect on pressure fluctuation amplitudes. Whistling amplitudes increase {{by a factor of}} 3 – 5 upon rounding off the upstream cavity edges. The radius of the downstream edge has a less pronounced effect on the sound amplitude and frequency. The geometric parameters of the multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> can easily be modified. This makes the multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> a convenient tool for making experiments on the effects of various geometric parameters.

In [...] "Little Isaac, Where are You Going?" [...] (1982), for example, {{on the left side of}} the painting there is a dark-colored scribble that looks like flower petals next to a <b>branched</b> <b>system</b> of lines, in pencil and in paint, creating images that look like a fire, like a question mark, etc. In 1983 the cyclamen can be discerned as a clear image, but the range of colors becomes darker.

In 1984 Gershuni created the series “Hai Cyclamens,” (18 Cyclamens) which was exhibited in the Givon Gallery in 1984. The series is composed of 18 paintings, each of which is spread over 2 sheets of paper held together by tape, making them 140 X 200 cm total in size. Besides the images of flower petals and cyclamen petals, which form a thick, upward-pointing tangle, quotations from Gouri’s song also appear in the paintings and a number of verses from Psalms 103: “who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion.” These verses are arranged around the edges of the paintings as a sort of frame.|$|E

Whistling induced by flow through such pipes can lead to serious environmental and structural problems. The whistling of a multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> is compared to the whistling behavior of corrugated pipes. The study has been restricted to cavities with sharp edges which are convenient for theoretical modeling. The side branch depth is chosen to be equal to the side branch diameter, which corresponds to cavity geometries in typical corrugated pipes. The low frequency resonance modes of the multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> have been predicted by means of acoustic models, of which the validity has been tested experimentally. Several experiments {{have been carried out}} for characterizing the whistling behavior of the system. While the behavior of a multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> is interesting on its own it can be compared to that of corrugated pipes. These experiments show that the multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> is in many aspects a reasonable model for corrugated pipes. Advantage of the multiple side <b>branch</b> <b>system</b> is that it is an experimental setup allowing easy modification of cavity depth. We used this feature to identify the pressure nodes of the acoustic standing wave along the main pipe as the regions where sound is produced. This contradicts recent publications on corrugated pipes. Another interesting aspects is that the system appears to whistle at the second hydrodynamic mode of the cavities rather than at the first hydrodynamic mode. A prediction model for the whistling behavior is proposed, consisting of an energy balance, based on the vortex sound theory. The model predicts the observed Strouhal number but overestimates the acoustic fluctuation amplitude by a factor four. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
