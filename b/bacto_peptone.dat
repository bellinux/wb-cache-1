40|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{we reported}} the isolation and preliminary characterization of a DNA ligase-encoding gene of Candida albicans. This gene (LIG 4) is the structural and functional homologue of both yeast and human ligase IV, which {{is involved in}} nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks. In the present study, we have shown {{that there are no}} other LIG 4 homologues in C. albicans. In order to study the function of LIG 4 in morphogenesis and virulence, we constructed gene deletions. LIG 4 transcript levels were reduced in the heterozygote and were completely absent in null strains. Concomitantly, the heterozygote showed a pronounced defect in myceliation, which was slightly greater in the null strain. This was true with several solid and liquid media, such as Spider medium, medium 199, and 2 % glucose– 1 % yeast extract– 2 % <b>Bacto</b> <b>Peptone,</b> at several pHs. Reintroduction of the wild-type allele into the null mutant partially restored the ability of cells to form hyphae. In agreement with the positive role of LIG 4 in morphogenesis, we detected a significant rise in mRNA levels during the morphological transition. LIG 4 is not essential for DNA replication or for the repair of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or UV light, indicating that these lesions are repaired primarily by homologous recombination. However, our data show that the NHEJ apparatus of C. albicans may control morphogenesis in this diploid organism. In addition, deletion of one or both copies of LIG 4 resulted in attenuation of virulence in a murine model of candidiasis...|$|E

A solution of triphenyltetrazolium in water then was added to give a final concentration of 0. 005 to 0. 05 per cent; over this range, the concentra-tion of tetrazolium did not affect the results. Wet mounts were examined with a Spencer no. 8 phase contrast microscope (dark phase con-trast). For continuous microscopic examination wet mounts with a reasonable thickness of sus-pension between slide and coverslips were used. Continuous observations using thin films of tetrazolium treated bacterial suspensions were found to be unsatisfactory as the sequence of events of tetrazolium reduction within the cells was practically stopped.

Animals may habituate to environmental temperature change using a range of mechanisms. To investigate mechanisms of temperature habituation, we exposed Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to a temperature of 2 °C, which is much colder than their normal growing temperature (approximately 10 – 28 °C) and we evaluated their survival rate in recovery from this cold shock. The survival rate after cold shock was different between animals grown at 15 °C and 25 °C, suggesting that C. elegans exhibits temperature-habituation-linked cold tolerance. Here we show in detail two protocols: a standard cold-tolerance assay after cultivation at constant temperature; and a multistep temperature-shifted cold-tolerance assay. (T. U. & A. O. contributed equally to this work.) ### Introduction The environmental conditions to which living organisms are exposed may change constantly. Therefore, animals possess a variety of mechanisms that adapt their physical or behavioral activities to such changes. Temperature causes direct biochemical changes within organisms and is {{a critical}} factor for their survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits temperature-responsive phenomena. The induction of dauer larvae and thermotaxis are well-known responses to high temperature 1, 2, 3, {{but it is not}} well understood how C. elegans habituates to cold temperature. C. elegans is unable to proliferate below 10 °C but previous reports suggested the existence of cold tolerance in this species. Cold tolerance enabling survival at 2 – 4 °C for a number of hours is regulated by phospholipid saturation and the aging pathway 4, 5. Xiao et al reported that culture temperature affects the longevity of cold-sensitive TRPA- 1 -defective mutants 6. Recently, we reported that light- and pheromone-sensing ASJ neurons detect temperature and control cold-tolerance through insulin signaling 7. This implies that a pair of sensory neurons promotes cold-temperature resistance in other tissues. Here we present our assay for cold tolerance following prior temperature experience. An established state of cold tolerance can be changed within three or more hours incubation at a new temperature, suggesting that the cultivation temperature is stored somewhere and can be replaced within a few hours of a new experience 7. Here we also describe our cultivation-temperature-shifted cold-tolerance assay. ### Materials 1. Nematode growth medium (NGM) seeded with E. coli (OP- 50) - We made NGM essentially according to the original protocol by Brenner with some modifications 8, 9, as follows. - Mix 3 g NaCl, 20 g agar (Ina, Japan), 2. 5 g <b>Bacto</b> <b>Peptone</b> (BD Falcon) and 975 ml H 2 O in an Erlenmeyer flask with a stirring bar and autoclave for 40 min. Cool the autoclaved medium to 50 °C with stirring; then add 1 ml of MgSO 4 (1 M), 1 ml of CaCl 2 (1 M), 25 ml of potassium phosphate (1 M, pH 6. 0) and 1 ml of cholesterol (5 mg/ml in ethanol). Dispense 14 ml of the medium to 60 mm diameter petri dishes, or 6 ml to 35 mm diameter petri dishes, with a sterile automatic dispenser. Then, seed liquid-cultured E. coli OP- 50 onto the well-solidified medium. - Worms - Adult animals were grown under well-fed conditions. ### Equipment 1. Incubators - We used incubator models CRB- 14 A (Hitachi, Japan) or FMU- 2041 (Fukushima Industries Corp., Japan) for worm cultivation at 15 – 25 °C and used the model CRB- 41 A or CRB- 14 A (Hitachi, Japan) as a refrigerator for the cold-shock incubation at 2 °C. ### Procedure Assay for cold-tolerance induced by temperature experience (Fig. 1, 2). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 : Assay for cold-tolerance induced by temperature experience**.

Place two adult nematodes (P 0) onto the NGM in 60 -mm diameter plates, which are the assay plates in the following procedure. - Incubate the assay plates at each experimental temperature for 8 – 12 h, until the P 0 adults have laid about 100 eggs. - Remove all P 0 adults to synchronize the stages of nematodes - Incubate the assay plates until the progeny develop to the adult stage at their respective temperatures, e. g. : - 15 °C, cultivate for 144 – 150 hours - 20 °C, cultivate for 85 – 90 hours - 25 °C, cultivate for 60 – 65 hours - Place the assay plates containing fully matured—but not old—adult animals directly onto ice for 20 min. Note that assay plates must be sealed by Parafilm with only half of their agar bottoms in contact with the ice. - Place the assay plates into a plastic container with a lid and transfer them to the refrigerator at 2 °C. - Incubate the assay plates at 2 °C for 48 h. - Store the assay plates at 15 °C overnight. - Count the numbers of dead and live adult animals, and calculate the survival rate. - At least nine assays (steps 1 to 9) are performed for each strain. Calculate mean survival rates and the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the data from more than nine assay plates. - If the growth rates of mutants are slower or faster than wild types, shift the laying day (step 2) to synchronize the start of the cold exposures of wild-types and mutants. - If the mutants have the constitutive dauer-formation phenotype (daf-c), cultivate them at 15 °C from eggs to L 4 larvae and then cultivate them overnight at the designated temperature (20 °C or 25 °C) before cold shock. Cultivation temperature-shifted cold-tolerance assay In this assay, the animals are cultivated from eggs to young adults or L 4 larvae at one temperature and then cultivated at a second temperature for some hours before cold shock. 1. Cultivate C. elegans to adults under well-fed conditions. Place two adult animals (P 0) onto the NGM in 60 -mm diameter plates, which are the assay plates in the following procedure. Three assay plates of the same strain are used for one assay. - Incubate the assay plates at the first temperature for 8 – 12 hours until the P 0 adults have laid about 100 eggs. - Remove all P 0 adults to synchronize the stages of the nematodes. - Incubate the assay plates until the progeny develop into young adults or adults at the first temperature, e. g. : - 15 °C, cultivate for 132 – 150 h - 20 °C, cultivate for 72 – 90 h - 25 °C, cultivate for 52 – 65 h - If step 5 involves 18 h incubation above 20 °C, it is best to move to this step when the animals are L 4 larvae. - Transfer the assay plates to another incubator kept at the second temperature and incubate for several hours (e. g., 0, 3, 5, 8, or 18 h). - After incubation at the second temperature, place the assay plates on ice for 20 min. Note that the assay plates must be sealed by Parafilm with only half of their agar bottoms in contact with the ice. - Place the assay plates into a plastic container with a lid and transfer them to the refrigerator at 2 °C - Incubate the assay plates at 2 °C for 48 h. - Store the assay plates at 15 °C overnight. - Count the numbers of dead and live adult animals, and calculate the survival rate. - Repeat the assay three times with three assay plates each and calculate the mean survival rates and the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the data from more than nine assay plates. ### Troubleshooting The cold-tolerance phenotype seems to be severely affected by humidity and other unknown factors. In particular, these effects are observed during changes of season. In Japan, these phenotypes change markedly in the rainy season. If the cold tolerance of mutant strains is changed, the cold-shock temperature or cold-shock time should be changed, e. g., 2 °C to 3. 5 °C and/or 24 hr to 72 hr. If 35 -mm diameter NGM plates are used, the number of eggs laid by P 0 adults should be reduced to fewer than 100 and the egg-laying time shortened, or the P 0 numbers per assay plate reduced. Temperature stability is is markedly different among different models of incubator or refrigerator. We frequently monitored the internal temperature of the incubators and refrigerator using an HA- 100 K digital thermometer (Anritsum, Japan). ### References 1. Golden, J. W. & Riddle, D. L.
