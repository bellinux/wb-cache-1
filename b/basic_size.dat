25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its <b>basic</b> <b>size.</b> They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E
25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the <b>basic</b> <b>size.</b> The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is obviously a replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical frame members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{diffusion}} of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) was recently boosted by the expiration of the FDM patent {{and the subsequent}} worldwide development of low cost FDM machines by {{a huge number of}} small companies. In most of the cases, FDM machines are worth what they cost. Thus the performance of expensive industrial FDM systems is better than that of low cost machines, also known as 3 D printers. In this paper a benchmarking is carried out between a Dimension EliteTM by Stratasys and a 3 D TouchTM by Bits from Bytes (BFB). The study and comparison is based on a reference part that was designed to fit into the building volume of most of low cost FDM machines. The part includes several classic geometries (planes, cylinders, spheres and cones) of different sizes to cover several ranges of <b>basic</b> <b>sizes</b> as defined by the ISO 286 standard. Geometric features appear both in the concave and convex shapes to account for all design possibilities. The proposed reference part allows to consider a higher number of features for each range of <b>basic</b> <b>sizes</b> with respect to other benchmarking models presented in the literature. Moreover the part does not require support structures for its production, allowing for manufacturing on 3 D printers that come with a unique extruder. Replicas of the reference part are printed out of ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material with different layer thicknesses using the compared machines. After inspecting the replicas by means of a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), the dimensional accuracy of the compared FDM systems is reported through part quality using IT grades associated with the ISO <b>basic</b> <b>sizes.</b> GD&T values are also evaluated for some of the geometric features appearing on the reference part...|$|R
