5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a <b>broker,</b> <b>who</b> gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Inside Man is a 2006 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Spike Lee, and written by Russell Gewirtz. The film centers on an elaborate bank heist on Wall Street over a 24-hour period.

5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, {{who was supposed to}} be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
5|$|Lester Burnham is {{a middle-aged}} {{advertising}} executive and magazine writer who despises his job. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious real estate <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> grows red roses in their yard; their teenage daughter, Jane, abhors {{her parents and}} has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts family, consisting of a homophobic retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife, Barbara, and their teenage son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time job as a bar caterer and waiter serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealings. Frank is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the Fitts family to the neighborhood. On the way to school, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with Ricky.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

25|$|Part of Brooks's appeal as a {{financial}} journalist was that he wrote for a general-interest publication, The New Yorker. Unlike journalists for more narrowly focused business publications, Brooks realized early on that it was storytelling and not financial jargon that would propel readers through his pieces. In his book Once in Golconda, Brooks devoted much of the book to fleshing out the character and peccadilloes of its protagonist, financier Richard Whitney, the aristocratic Morgan <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> headed the New York Stock Exchange, but ended up in Sing Sing Prison for his misdeeds.|$|E
25|$|A {{short seller}} {{typically}} borrows through a <b>broker,</b> <b>who</b> is usually holding the securities for another investor {{who owns the}} securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller. The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities {{for a number of}} investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{challenges}} of anti-terrorist FININT is that surveillance of transactions only works when the value transfers go through conventional, regulated banks and other financial institutions. Many cultures use informal value transfer systems, such as the hawala widely used in the Middle East and Asia, where value is transferred through a network of <b>brokers,</b> <b>who</b> operate with funds often not in banks, with the value transfer orders through personal communications among <b>brokers,</b> <b>who</b> know one another and operate on a paperless honor system.|$|R

Aubrey gets along with everyone and his love of food is often joked about.

In season 11, it is found out that Aubrey's father is back in the country.|$|E
25|$|Owners of ADRs are {{typically}} {{notified in writing}} at least thirty days prior to a termination. Once notified, an owner can surrender their ADRs and take delivery of the foreign securities represented by the Receipt, or do nothing. If an ADR holder elects to take possession of the underlying foreign shares, {{there is no guarantee}} the shares will trade on any U.S. exchange. The holder of the foreign shares would have to find a <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> has trading authority in the foreign market where those shares trade. If the owner continues to hold the ADR past the effective date of termination, the depositary bank will continue to hold the foreign deposited securities and collect dividends, but will cease distributions to ADR owners.|$|E
25|$|Climaco {{was born}} in Zamboanga City, {{the son of a}} customs <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> later became a {{municipal}} councilor. He finished his primary and secondary education in his hometown, then moved to Manila together with his future wife, Julia, to pursue a college education. He enrolled in a pre-law course at the University of Santo Tomas and worked as a family driver to finance his studies. He then studied law at the University of the Philippines College of Law, working {{at the same time as}} a janitor at the Court of Appeals. Coincidentally, his older brother Rafael, also a law student at UP, became an associate justice of the Court of Appeals under President Marcos. Climaco earned his law degree in 1941, and was admitted to the Philippine bar later that year after having passed the bar examinations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In many {{developing}} democracies local party brokers distribute mate-rial benefits to voters. Yet {{we find that}} many brokers consume a share of these goods. This raises important puzzles. Why do party bosses rely on <b>brokers</b> <b>who</b> take goods {{that could be used}} to win votes? Why do voters support parties whose brokers take their goods? We argue that brokers must be compensated for the voters they mobilize. Bosses can motivate some brokers with the promise of polit-ical careers, but these careers are scarce. Thus, bosses tolerate many <b>brokers</b> <b>who</b> steal resources for their compensation. Since a broker’s mobilizing effort gives a boss incentives to channel resources to a broker’s constituency, voters also tolerate <b>brokers</b> <b>who</b> skim some resources to compensate themselves for the costs of their effort. We develop our argument formally, and evaluate it with extensive qualita-tive evidence and a unique survey of brokers in Argentina...|$|R

25|$|Each ADR {{is issued}} by a {{domestic}} custodian bank when the underlying shares are deposited {{in a foreign}} depositary bank, usually by a <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent {{a fraction of a}} share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of a DR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the DR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the DR. The price of a DR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of DRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5% creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. Depositary banks have various responsibilities to DR holders and to the issuing foreign company the DR represents.|$|E
25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist <b>broker,</b> <b>who</b> is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E
25|$|Charles Pouch-Lafarge was a big, coarse man of twenty-eight, {{a son of}} Jean-Baptiste Lafarge, {{justice of}} the peace in Vigeois. In 1817, his father bought the former charterhouse, or Carthusian monastery, in the hamlet of Le Glandier in Corrèze, run by Carthusian monks since the 13th century, but fallen into {{disrepair}} after its suppression in the French Revolution. In an effort to make it profitable, Charles turned part of the estate into a foundry, a venture that plunged him into debt. In 1839, bankrupt, he saw a good marriage as the only way to pay his creditors. He engaged the same marriage <b>broker</b> <b>who</b> was hired to find a husband for Marie. Charles advertised himself as a wealthy iron master with property worth more than 200,000 francs with an annual income of 30,000 from the foundry alone. He also carried letters of recommendation from his priest and local deputy. To hide the fact that a marriage broker was involved in this, Marie's uncle passed off Charles as a friend and arranged a fortuitous meeting with Marie at the opera. Marie found Charles common and repulsive, but since he advertised himself as the owner of a palatial estate, she agreed to marry him. Thus, four days after the meeting, her aunt announced their engagement, and they were married on 10 August 1839. The couple then left Paris for Le Glandier to live at the estate.|$|E
