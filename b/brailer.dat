50|$|In 1992, <b>Brailer</b> left {{academia and}} founded a company {{spun out of}} his Ph.D. thesis, inventing ways to measure health-care quality. This became CareScience Inc., a Philadelphia {{software}} firm that helped hospitals improve efficiency and prevent errors. Under <b>Brailer,</b> CareScience established the nation's first health care Application Service Provider (ASP). <b>Brailer</b> led the company through several financings, strategic partnerships, {{an initial public offering}} in 2000, and sale to global software firm Quovadx in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|The first National Coordinator of Health Information Technology, {{physician}} and venture capitalist, David <b>Brailer,</b> laid critical {{groundwork for a}} vision of the role extensive use of electronic health records could play in the modernization of clinical paperwork and digitization of healthcare. <b>Brailer</b> resigned from the position on April 20, 2006.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brailer</b> {{serves on}} a number of boards of directors, {{including}} CenseoHealth, Prolacta Biosciences and Walgreens.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brailer</b> was {{the first}} {{recipient}} of the National Library of Medicine Martin Epstein Award {{for his work in}} expert systems.|$|E
50|$|David J. <b>Brailer</b> {{is known}} for his {{leadership}} and advocacy for health information technology specifically founding and investing in leading health IT companies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brailer</b> {{remained}} in his government post for two years. Following his public service, he transitioned {{to the private}} sector where he has held several executive and advisory positions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brailer</b> holds {{doctoral}} degrees in both medicine and economics. He earned his Ph.D. in managerial economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and his M.D. from West Virginia University.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} a general medicine residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, <b>Brailer</b> began {{work as an}} active patient-care physician in general medicine and in immune deficiency at the University of Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|While {{in medical}} school, {{he was a}} Charles A. Dana Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine {{and was the first}} {{recipient}} of the National Library of Medicine Martin Epstein Award for his work in expert systems. <b>Brailer</b> was among the first medical students to serve on the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association. He completed his medical residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and became board certified in internal medicine along the clinical investigator pathway. <b>Brailer</b> was a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and, until recently, was active in patient care delivery with an emphasis on immune deficiency.|$|E
50|$|On May 6, 2004, <b>Brailer</b> was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} National Health Information Technology Coordinator, pursuant to an executive order by President George W. Bush on April 27, 2004, which called for widespread deployment of health information technology within 10 years.|$|E
50|$|In this role, <b>Brailer</b> {{designed}} and directed a bipartisan effort {{to encourage the}} digitalization of health care. His work {{led to the formation}} of both the National Health Information Network and the Meaningful Use incentives program for the adoption of electronic health records.|$|E
50|$|In mid-2007, <b>Brailer</b> founded Health Evolution Partners, {{a private}} equity fund with a mission to “invest in things that can reduce the {{crushing}} costs of health care.” The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) invested $700 million in the fund. He is currently Managing Director and CEO of the firm.|$|E
50|$|After CareScience, <b>Brailer</b> took an {{advisory}} role at Health Technology Center, a non-profit {{research and education}} organization that provides strategic information and resources to health care organizations about the future impact of technology in health care delivery. There, he advised the Center {{on a number of}} regional and national data sharing projects.|$|E
50|$|On May 6, 2004, Dr. <b>Brailer</b> was {{appointed}} by the administration of President George W. Bush as the nation's first 'Health Information Technology Czar'. Brailer's official title was National Health Information Technology Coordinator. In this role, he developed the nation's strategy for electronic records, information sharing, consumer empowerment and transformation of research and public health {{with the goal of}} widespread deployment of health information technology within 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) {{is charged}} with {{creating}} an interoperable health information technology infrastructure for the nation. That infrastructure has been primarily defined as an electronic health records system, however, former National Coordinator David <b>Brailer</b> indicated his support for personal health records that are portable and controlled by consumers. It {{remains to be seen}} how his successor, Robert Kolodner, will interpret this charge.|$|E
40|$|Can pay for {{performance}} inspire the enhanced {{use of information}} technology (IT) in medical practice to im-prove {{the quality of care}} and the efficiency of care delivery? This question is receiving considerable attention from physician leaders and policy makers, including the recently appointed Bush administration electronic medical records czar David <b>Brailer,</b> M. D., Ph. D., and Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Mark McClellan, M. D., Ph. D. 1 “Pay-for-performance initiatives [...] . will help reduce barriers to the adoption of electronic health records [...] . and in turn, help physicians improve quality and patient safety, ” says <b>Brailer.</b> Their interest is not surprising, given that some pay-for-performance programs directly link incentives with the adoption and use of IT in both physician groups and individual practice settings. Yet, how much do we really know about the effectiveness of these incentives in stim-ulating investments in IT? The growing popularity and prevalence of pay-for-performance programs in the United States is indis-putable. Only a handful of these programs existed a decade ago, but this number has rapidly grown in recent years to between 80 and 100 programs today. 2 Some of the more prominent programs, including those sponsored by Bridges to Excellence and the Integrated Healthcare Association (IHA), offer incentives to physicians who demonstrate the use of specific IT capabilities, such as point-of-care electronic prescribing or an electronic med-ical record (EMR). 3, 4 To date, however, information about the influence of pay {{for performance}} on the use of IT by physicians has been limited. “Pay-for-performance initiatives [...] . will help reduce barriers to the adoption of electronic health records [...] . in turn, help physicians improve quality and patient safety. ” The influence of the IHA pay-for-performance pro-gram on the expanding adoption of IT provides a snap-shot of the program’s impact to date. The results demonstrate that incentives have captured the attention o...|$|E
40|$|An integer-programming {{model and}} a post-solution {{heuristic}} allocates operating room {{time to the}} five surgical divisions at Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital. The hospital has used this approach {{for several years and}} credits it with both administrative savings and the ability to produce quickly an equitable master surgical schedule. (Health care: hospitals. Programming: integer, applications) I n most developed countries, except the UnitedStates, strategies for providing universal access to health care while containing costs involve formal or informal caps on health-care spending (Pierskalla and <b>Brailer</b> 1994, p. 470). As a result of centrally con-strained funds, resource-allocation problems in which a central authority must plan for and allocate limited resources to competing groups or services are common issues in health-care planning at the national, regional, and institutional levels. Canadian experience suggests that a centrally im...|$|E
40|$|Scientists aboard French {{purse seine}} vessels {{recorded}} {{the number and}} condition of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) caught during three fishing cruises in the Indian Ocean. A sample of 31 individuals that showed signs of life were tagged with satellite tags to investigate their postrelease mortality. The majority of individuals (95 %) were brought on board using the <b>brailer.</b> Combining the proportion of sharks that were dead (72 %) and the mortality rate of those released (48 %), the overall mortality rate of brailed individuals was 85 %. Few individuals (5 %) were not brailed as they were entangled and landed during the hauling process. The survival rate of these individuals was high, with an overall mortality rate of meshed individuals of 18 %. The combination of these two categories led to an overall mortality rate of 81 %. This high value reflects the harsh conditions encountered by sharks during the purse seine fishing process. Consequently, methods that prevent sharks being brought on board are a priority for future investigations, but good handling practices should also be promoted as they could reduce mortality by at least 19 %...|$|E
40|$|To {{paraphrase}} Pierskalla & <b>Brailer</b> [7], capacity planning {{relates to}} the optimal selection of resource levels {{that need to be}} determined at the time of construction of a new facility. In health care, quantities such as the number of operating rooms, bed spaces or X-ray machines are examples of interest. This is an introductory exploration into capacity management for facilities that treat chronic illnesses. For the sake of concreteness, we will focus our attention on the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). ESRD is a fatal kidney disease that affects close to half a million patients in the US and many more worldwide [8], [9]. ESRD patients rely on dialysis therapy for continuance of survival, and upon registration with a dialysis clinic a new patient begins receiving therapy thrice a week until a kidney transplant is performed. We shall define one unit of capacity as the level of resource required to provide maintenance treatment to one patient. For those afflicted with ESRD, it may take several years to identify a suitable kidney donor [6]. In the meantime, patients are frequently hospitalized for complications from the dialysis treatment itself, giving rise to temporary freed capacity at the clinic. This hospitalization effect is characteristic of facilities for chronic illnesses in general, and is analogous to the concep...|$|E
