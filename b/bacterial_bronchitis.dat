5000|$|Sputum [...] is mucus and is {{the name}} used for the coughed-up {{material}} (phlegm) from the lower airways (trachea and bronchi).

It is critical that the patient not give a specimen that includes any mucoid material from {{the interior of the}} nose. Naked eye exam of sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below). Any hint of yellow color suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate between the types of organisms causing it). Such color hints are best detected when the sputum is viewed on a very white background such as white paper, a white pot, or a white sink surface.

25|$|On 5 November 2015, the U.S. FDA held a {{joint meeting}} of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee to discuss risks and {{benefits}} of the systemic fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs for the acute bacterial sinusitis, acute <b>bacterial</b> exacerbations of <b>bronchitis</b> in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The U.S. FDA asked the committee to review reports of tendonitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiac arrhythmia associated with long-term disability to determine whether the benefits of fluoroquinolone therapy in these indications justifies the associated risk.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory {{illness is}} a {{significant}} contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It {{has been suggested that}} Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is no longer the most frequent cause of respiratory disease in this group because of widespread use of prophylaxis and anti-retroviral drugs. METHODS: A retrospective comparison of the diagnoses in HIV 1 antibody positive patients with respiratory illness admitted to a major UK centre in 1986 - 7 and 1990 - 1 was carried out to identify changes in patterns of respiratory disease. RESULTS: In the 1986 - 7 period there were 73 patients, of whom none received zidovudine or prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia while in the 1990 - 1 period there were 122 patients. One hundred and ninety patients (98 %) were male homosexuals. Pneumocystis pneumonia remained the commonest respiratory disease, comprising 68 % of all diagnoses in the 1986 - 7 period and 48 % in the 1990 - 1 period. <b>Bacterial</b> infections (<b>bronchitis</b> and pneumonia) were seen more commonly in the 1990 - 1 period (23 %) than in the 1986 - 7 period (14 %), as was pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (12 % in 1990 - 1 and 4 % in 1986 - 7). Mycobacterial infection remained uncommon (4 % in 1986 - 7 and 6. 5 % in 1990 - 1).

40|$|Chronic cough in {{childhood}} {{is associated with}} a high morbidity and decreased quality of life. Protracted <b>bacterial</b> <b>bronchitis</b> (PBB) seems to be the second most common cause of chronic cough in children under 6 years of age. Its main clinical feature is represented by wet cough that worsens when changing posture and improves after the introduction of antibiotics. Currently, the mainstay of PBB treatment is a 2 -week therapy with a high dose of antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, to eradicate the infection and restore epithelial integrity. It is very important to contemplate this disease in a child with chronic cough since the misdiagnosis of PBB could lead to complications such as bronchiectasis. Clinicians, however, often do not consider this disease in the differential diagnosis and, consequently, they are inclined to change the antibiotic therapy rather than to extend it or to add steroids.

40|$|Background: Protracted <b>bacterial</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is a {{major cause}} of {{persistent}} cough in childhood. The organisms most commonly isolated are nontypable Haemophilus infiuenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. There are no studies addressing typing of these organisms when recovered from the lower airways. Methods: Isolates of these two organisms (identified in BAL samples from children undergoing routine investigation of a chronic cough thought to be attributable to a protracted <b>bacterial</b> <b>bronchitis)</b> were subject to typing. Samples were collected in Sheffield, England, and Athens, Greece. The majority of the children from Sheffield had received pneumococcal-conjugate vaccines 7 or 13 (PCV- 7 or PCV- 13) conjugate vaccine but only a minority of Greek children had received PCV- 7. Results: All 18 S pneumoniae isolates from Greek BAL samples are serotypes contained in PCV- 13 while 10 are contained in PCV- 7. In contrast, 28 of the 39 samples from Sheffield contained serotypes that are not included in PCV- 13. All 26 of the nontypable H influenzae samples obtained in Sheffield produced distinct multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis profiles. There was a significant difference between children from Athens and Sheffield in the distribution of serotypes contained or not contained in the pneumococcal vaccine (P =. 04). More specifically, immunization with pneumococcal vaccine was related with isolation of S pneumoniae serotypes not included in the vaccine (OR, 0. 021; CI, 0. 003 - 0. 115; P <. 001). Conclusions: The data suggest that both vaccine and nonvaccine S pneumoniae serotypes {{may play a role in}} protracted <b>bacterial</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and provide some hints that serotype replacement may occur in response to the introduction of conjugate vaccines.
