Zack Mills finished 11 of 24 for 114yards, becoming Penn State's career leader in total offense and also moved into second place on the school's passing yardage list.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> new to us.|$|E

500|$|The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's {{first ever}} {{win in a}} medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women, and it still remains {{the only time that}} the United States did not win the men's event. After the race, the team made a celebratory dive into the water and {{performed}} a poolside interview. Tonelli remarked that [...] "I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it". Australia's women's captain Lisa Forrest hailed the win as [...] "a gold medal that should never have been". Evans said of the relay, [...] "It was unbelievable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking," [...] as Brooks dedicated his win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{then asked}} Ono {{if she had}} any {{unreleased}} recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was recorded by Lennon in 1977, in his and Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, [...] "Free—as a boid" [...] (bird). The other songs were [...] "Grow Old With Me", [...] "Real Love", and [...] "Now and Then". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: [...] "People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul." ...|$|E

500|$|Diefenbaker {{suggested}} {{to the jury}} that the silence on the line which had, he contended, swallowed the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] might {{have been caused by}} a fish dropped on a snow-covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence. He noted in his memoirs that the incident [...] "was not well documented, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> we had". He blamed the disaster on Tisdale, stating that lack of the word [...] "at" [...] before [...] "Gosnell" [...] in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not been paying attention, and that he should have noticed that, according to Diefenbaker, the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] were missing from Atherton's repeat of the order. The trial had taken four days; the lawyers argued for five hours; Diefenbaker's summation took three of them. Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury. McFarlane told the jurors that if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor Mainprize in the same form he had received it, they would be justified in acquitting him. The jury returned after 40minutes of deliberations. Jury foreman Fred Mounkley announced the acquittal of Atherton, as Atherton's mother wept.|$|E
500|$|Burt Reynolds makes a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "The Man from Jupiter", as the love interest of Malory Archer. His guest appearance was formally announced in October 2011. Prior to his appearance, Reynolds was referenced in several episodes of the series. Series creator Adam Reed opined: [...] "I {{think the only}} person on the planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script up pretty good. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being in the room with Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed. [...] "Just hearing him read the stuff that I wrote, it was pretty great." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerry led off in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s to put Australia in second place, almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Evans had out-split Goodhew by 0.8s and Miskarov by 0.5s. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had ever done before. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then performed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first-ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed at the poolside. Evans said that the relay [...] "was unbelievable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking." ...|$|E

500|$|Ransom's men {{managed to}} {{come closer to}} the Union line than any Confederates that day, guided by the {{flashing}} light of the cannons amidst an encroaching darkness; however, George Sykes's artillery repelled that attack. The brigades of Kershaw and Semmes, sent earlier by Lee, arrived to the front while Ransom was moving to attack in another position. Semmes and Kershaw were quickly sent in; they too were repulsed not long after. Semmes was west of the junction of Carter's Mill Road and Willis Church Road, {{in the vicinity of}} Barksdale, Mahone and Wright. Semmes made the final charge of the day west of these roads, [...] and like the charges before, it was to little effect. Kershaw angled east, in the area where Toombs, Anderson and Cobb had attacked. This was an area of great confusion. Kershaw's troops arrived ahead of all the reinforcements sent by Jackson, and took fire from both friendly and hostile forces: from Confederates behind them firing [...] wildly and Federals in front firing effectively. Kershaw's men retreated in rout. The brigades behind Kershaw charged incoherently, with some men pushing forward, and others getting separated from their units or confused when they encountered groups of retreating Confederates. Disorganized, retreating soldiers from various units were so numerous that they slowed Jackson's men to nearly a standstill. Jackson's unit commanders attempted to organize their various regiments and rally the retreaters to join in, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> to very little effect. A few units fought fiercely against Union infantry and artillery. In particular, three regiments of Barlow's brigade made it close enough to Union lines to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the troops of Brig. Gen. Daniel Sickles before being driven back.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Judge Me" [...] is a midtempo ballad {{that runs}} {{for three minutes}} and fifteen seconds, with {{instrumentation}} provided by drums. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] features [...] "a slow, sensuous romp", which she found reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him [...] "for his past indiscretions" [...] and [...] "move on with the future." [...] In the song, Brown encourages his lover {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, [...] "You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what they saying / Because most of it is true / <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> before I fell for you." [...] He later declares [...] "that he is a changed man who can now be trusted" [...] as shown in the lines, [...] "Take me as I am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / The one that you can trust." [...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / before it gets beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna [...] "may be the inspiration" [...] for the lyrics. Rolling Stones Maura Johnston described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as [...] "a tender love song," [...] Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-08-16}} while Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine referred to it as a [...] "take me as I am" [...] type of ballad. Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] is similar to Brown's 2009 song, [...] "Changed Man." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed [...] "Argus", {{noting that}} it was [...] "entertaining, funny and had some killer one-liners" [...] and that it {{featured}} [...] "all kinds of silly but in a very winning way." [...] Rabin enjoyed all the plots featured here, and praised Will Forte's role as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator. Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the peacock storyline [...] "felt too silly", and that Forte [...] "was too underused as Paul", nonetheless said that despite not being the greatest 30 Rock episode of all time [...] "there were still some hilarious lines." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning liked Grizz's dilemma plot, commenting that Grizz not trying to hurt Tracy's feelings while Tracy tried to keep Dot Com away from Grizz's bride-to-be [...] "offered up some inspired lunacy." [...] His only complaint about [...] "Argus" [...] was Jack's plot as he deemed it disappointing. A review in TV Guide by Adam Mersel said [...] "...Fey and the gang {{live up to the}} challenge, and produce [...] a hilarious, quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive towards the episode, reasoning that the writing [...] "is just so deliciously absurd that I can't help but giggle the whole way through", and that the plots featured here were [...] "sublimely inconsequential. Not a whole lot happened, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> very funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] us back to the show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise. It wasn't 100% consistent, but there were so many good one-liners to counterbalance the misfires that it didn't even matter. This is 30 Rock the way it should be." [...] The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that Grizz's wedding story was [...] "pure filler, but everything on the show's kind of filler for the wackiness, so it mostly worked." [...] Carlson wrote that the best part from [...] "Argus" [...] came with Forte's Paul as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator.|$|E
