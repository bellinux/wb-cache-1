He cited the group's fusion of hip hop production and live instrumentation for Sons of Soul as {{the inspiration for}} his subsequent work {{as a member of}} A Tribe Called Quest and The Ummah. Muhammad discussed his experience recording Sons of Soul in a 1998 interview, saying that [...] "I'd just hooked this beat up, and [...] picked up their instruments and started playing.

[...] Tamsyn Wilce from Alter The Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating [...] "it shows just how strong her vocal cords are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own." ...|$|E

Auction prices for works by previous winners have generally increased. [...] The award has also seen some unexpected results: [...] Tracey Emin's My Bed, was overlooked in 1999 despite drawing large crowds to the Tate. [...] The Chapman brothers and Willie Doherty lost out to Grayson Perry in 2003– Perry accepted the award dressed as a girl while Jake Chapman described [...] "losing the Turner prize to a grown man dressed as a small girl" [...] as his [...] "most embarrassing moment".|$|E

500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic.

According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction we got in the US <b>blew</b> <b>me</b> away.

The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E

The new album included a later take of [...] "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. [...] With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version. This take is also the one seen in the film Let It Be and on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Starr said of the Let It Be... Naked version: [...] "There's nothing wrong with Phil's strings , this is just a different attitude to listening.

I just wandered into the theatre and it just <b>blew</b> <b>me</b> away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it.

40|$|The Cambrian age <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook {{formation}} of the Humber Arm Allochthon has been poorly understood since geological study began in the area more than 140 years ago. A detailed study has never been carried out exclusively on the formation, nor a complete stratigraphy designated. The aim of this thesis is to compose a stratigraphy for the <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation based upon sedimentology, petrography and ichnology. [...] Regional mapping of coastal sedimentary strata from the community of Fox Island River, north to Rope Cove is used to show extensive and continuous sections of <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation. These exposures, paired with a recently documented basal contact between <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook red shale beds and underlying Fox Island River volcanics, have allowed development of a composite stratigraphy for the <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation. The formation, herein estimated to be about 400 m thick, is formed of six informal, but distinct stratigraphic units: A, B, C, D, E and F. Unit A, massive red shale interbedded with volcanics; Unit B, thick bedded red (hematitic) and greenish coloured micaceous sublithrenite and lithic subarkose; Unit C, quartz and feldspar pebble conglomerate with calcarenite boulders; Unit D, coarse grained greenish coloured quartzarenite and sublitharenite with minor subarkose interbedded with red, green and grey shale; Unit E, massive siliceous red and black shale, and Unit F; a quartzose greenish sandstone interbedded with black shales. [...] The sandstones of Unit F are commonly petroliferous, and tend {{to be associated with}} the calcareous Northern Head Group. One area (near Sluice Brook) shows evidence for a petroleum system in the <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation. Here, petroliferous <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation overlies the Northern Head Group in an antiformal structure. The shales of the Northern Head Group have a 'greasy' texture and may have acted as a source rock; overlying beds of red shales form a seal. [...] The <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation is derived from offshore turbidity flows, with little understanding of how the formation relates to the Summerside and Irishtown formations of the same age. With knowledge of the stratigraphy and petrography stronger arguments may be made for correlating the Summerside formation with lower units A and B of the <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation. The more quartzose upper units C, D, E, and F of the <b>Blow</b> <b>Me</b> Down Brook formation may be correlated to the Irishtown formation. [...] By careful recognition of strata and successions, it may be feasible to effectively map these rocks across the region. ...|$|R
