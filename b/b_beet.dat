40|$|The genomes of an Australian and a Canadian isolate {{of potato}} leafroll virus have been cloned and sequenced. The {{sequences}} of both isolates are similar (about 93 %), but the Canadian isolate (PLRV-C) is {{more closely related}} (about 98 % identity) to a Scottish (PLRV-S) and a Dutch isolate (PLRV-N) than to the Australian isolate (PLRV-A). The 5 '-terminal 18 nucleotide residues of PLRV-C, PLRV-A, PLRV-N and beet western yellows virus have 17 residues in common. In contrast, PLRV-S shows no obvious similarity in this region. PLRV-A and PLRV-C genomic sequences have localized regions of marked diversity, in particular a 600 nucleotide residue sequence in the polymerase gene. These data provide a world-wide perspective on the molecular biology of PLRV strains and their comparison with other luteoviruses and related RNA plant viruses {{suggests that there are}} two major subgroups in the plant luteoviruses. Potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV; Matthews, 1982; Waterhouse et al., 1988) is transmitted in a persistent manner by aphids and is responsible for significant world-wide economic losses in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) (Rochow & Duffus, 1981). The small isometric particles of PLRV are 25 nm in diameter and encapsidate a positive-sense RNA genome (Mr about 2 x 106) that has a small genome-linked protein and no significant stretches of polyadenylate (Mayo et al., 1982). Amongst luteoviruses the nucleotide sequences of the PAV serotype of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV) (Miller et al., 1988 a, <b>b),</b> <b>beet</b> western yellows virus (BWYV) (Veidt et al., 1988) and two European strains of PLRV (Mayo et al., 1989; van der Wilk et al., 1989) have been published.

We {{examined the effects of}} stabilized SS application on soil properties, biomass production, and phytoavailability of Cu and Zn to plants grown in two contrasting soils, Entisol and Aridisol. Stabilized SS mixtures were created by mixing SS in a 3 -to- 1 ratio with bentonite (<b>B),</b> sugar <b>beet</b> factory lime (SL), brick factory fly ash (BFA), rice straw (RS), water hyacinth (WH), and 50 : 50 mixture of RS and SL. Mixtures were applied at 50 Mg ha(- 1), and Sorghum vulgare L. and Eurica sativa were grown in a pot experiment. All the amendments increased plant availability and uptake of both Cu and Zn compared to the unamended control. The application of stabilized SS increased dry plant biomass significantly and decreased DTPA-extractable elements compared to the non-stabilized SS treatment. We conclude that of the six amendments studied, especially sugar beet factory lime (SL) and bentonite (B), are promising for the stabilization of metalcontaminated biosolids and should be tested under field conditions...|$|R

Application of stabilized SS increased significantly Olsen-P, with high increasing rate with SBFL and WH-stabilized SS. Stabilized-SS decreased significantly Cu and Zn availability compared to mono SS treatment.

Whereas the life cycle of the dicotyledonous model species Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by two epistatic genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FRIGIDA [1, 2, 3], three unrelated loci (VERNALIZATION 1 ??? 3) determine the spring and winter habits of monocotyledonous plants such as temperate cereals [4, 5, 6]. In the core eudicot species Beta vulgaris, whose lineage diverged from that leading to Arabidopsis shortly after the monocot-dicot split 140 million years ago [7, 8], the bolting locus B [9] is a master switch distinguishing annuals from biennials. Here, we isolated B and show that the pseudo-response regulator gene BOLTING TIME CONTROL 1 (BvBTC 1), through regulation of the FLOWERING LOCUS T genes [10], is absolutely necessary for flowering and mediates the response to both long days and vernalization. Our results suggest that domestication of beets involved the selection of a rare partial loss-of-function BvBTC 1 allele that imparts reduced sensitivity to photoperiod that is restored by vernalization, thus conferring bienniality, and illustrate how evolutionary plasticity at a key regulatory point can enable new life cycle strategies...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{flow and}} {{introgression}} from cultivated to wild plant populations have important evolutionary and ecological consequences and require detailed investigations for risk assessments of transgene escape into natural ecosystems. Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) {{are of particular}} concern because: (i) they are cross-compatible with their wild relatives (the sea <b>beet,</b> <b>B.</b> vulgaris ssp. maritima); (ii) crop-to-wild gene flow is likely to occur via weedy lineages resulting from hybridization events and locally infesting fields. Using a chloroplastic marker {{and a set of}} nuclear microsatellite loci, the occurrence of crop-to-wild gene flow was investigated in the French sugar beet production area within a 'contact-zone' in between coastal wild populations and sugar beet fields. The results did not reveal large pollen dispersal from weed to wild beets. However, several pieces of evidence clearly show an escape of weedy lineages from fields via seed flow. Since most studies involving the assessment of transgene escape from crops to wild outcrossing relatives generally focused only on pollen dispersal, this last result was unexpected: it points out the key role of a long-lived seed bank and highlights support for transgene escape via man-mediated long-distance dispersal events...|$|R

The research was carried out at 60 different localities with altitudes 112 - 220 m a. s. l. Sugar beet root aphid was recorded at 30 localities. The aphid was recorded in Slovakia for the first time, but its occurrence was predicted and symptoms and harmfulness overlooked by now.

When cysts {{were removed from}} the aldicarb solufions and then treated for 4 wk in sugarbeet root diffusate, larvae hatched and emerged. Treatments of newly hatched larvae of H. schachtii with 5 - 100 μg/ml aldicarb depressed later development of larvae on sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris). Similar treatments with aldicarb sulfoxide had less effect on larval development, and aldicarb sulfone had no effect. Numbers of treated larvae that survived and developed were inversely proportional to concentration (0. 1 - 5. 0 μg/ml) and duration (0 - 14 days) of aldicarb treatments. Development of H. schachtii on sugarbeet grown in aldicarb-treated soil was inversely proportional to the concentration of aldicarb in the tested range of 0. 75 - 3. 0 μg aldicarb/g of soil.

In this study, we analyzed the abundance and diversity of the hAT transposon superfamily of the sugar <b>beet</b> (<b>B.</b> vulgaris) genome, using molecular, bioinformatic and cytogenetic approaches. We identified 81 transposase-coding sequences, three of which are part of structurally intact but nonfunctional hAT transposons (BvhAT), in a B. vulgaris BAC library {{as well as in}} whole genome sequencing-derived data sets. Additionally, 116 complete and 497 truncated non-autonomous BvhAT derivatives lacking the transposase gene were in silico-detected. The 116 complete derivatives were subdivided into four BvhATpin groups each characterized by a distinct terminal inverted repeat motif. Both BvhAT and BvhATpin transposons are specific for species of the genus Beta and closely related species, showing a localization on B. vulgaris chromosomes predominantely in euchromatic regions. The lack of any BvhAT transposase function together with the high degree of degeneration observed for the BvhAT and the BvhATpin genomic fraction contrasts with the abundance and activity of autonomous and non-autonomous hAT transposons revealed in other plant species. This indicates a possible genus-specific structural and functional repression of the hAT transposon superfamily during Beta diversification and evolution...|$|R

Feeding different amino acids to betalain-forming hairy root cultures of yellow beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris “Golden Beet”) showed that all amino acids (S- and R-forms) led to the corresponding betaxanthins. We observed neither an amino acid specificity nor a stereoselectivity in this process. In addition, increasing the endogenous phenylalanine (Phe) level by feeding the Phe ammonia-lyase inhibitor 2 -aminoindan 2 -phosphonic acid yielded the Phe-derived betaxanthin. Feeding amino acids or 2 -aminoindan 2 -phosphonic acid to hypocotyls of fodder <b>beet</b> (<b>B.</b> vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris “Altamo”) plants led to the same results. Furthermore, feeding cyclo- 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) -alanine (cyclo-Dopa) to these hypocotyls resulted in betanidin formation, indicating that the decisive step in betacyanin formation proceeds spontaneously. Finally, feeding betalamic acid to broad bean (Vicia faba L.) seedlings, which are known to accumulate high levels of Dopa but do not synthesize betaxanthins, resulted in the formation of dopaxanthin.

40|$|Cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} (CMS), the maternally inherited failure to produce functional pollen, {{has been used}} in the breeding of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris). At least three different sources of CMS can be distinguished from one another as well as from normal fertile cytoplasm by polymorphisms in their mitochondrial genomes. Here we analyzed 50 accessions of cultivated and wild beets to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among male-sterility-inducing and normal cytoplasms. The haplotypes were characterized by the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial cox 2 -cox 1 spacer region and mitochondrial minisatellite loci. The results indicated that (1) a normal cytoplasm line, cv.

Wild <b>beets</b> (sea <b>beets,</b> <b>B.</b> vulgaris spp. maritima and their naturalized introgressions with cultivated beets known as ruderal beets) harbor substantial genetic diversity that could be useful for beet improvement. Here, we compared molecular and morpho-physiological traits of wild beets collected on the Adriatic coast of Italy with sugar beet using eight primer-pairs amplifying 194 polymorphic fragments and four root traits (glucose and fructose content in the root tip, root elongation rate, number of the of root tips, total root length and its distribution among diameters ranges). Genetic diversity was higher in the sea beet accession, which {{may be due to}} the highly variable selection pressures that occur in heterogeneous ecological niches, compared with the ruderal and cultivated beets. Sea and sugar beet accessions showed contrasting root patterns in response to sulfate deprivation: sugar beet showed an increase of reducing sugars in the root tips and higher root elongation rate, and the sea beet accession showed an increase in root tip number, total root length and fine root length (average diameter. 5 mm). The ruderal beet showed intermediary responses to sea and sugar beet accessions. AFLP and morpho-physiological cluster analyzes showed sea, ruderal and cultivated beets to be genetically distinct groups. The results of this study indicate variability in response to sulfate deprivation is present in undomesticated beets that could be deployed for sugar beet improvement...|$|R
40|$|Weed beet {{cannot be}} {{controlled}} by herbicides in sugar beet (except via height-selective applicators) {{as it is a}} crop relative, descending from accidentally flowering sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) crop plants either because of vernalization during cold springs, or presence of a dominant bolting allele in sugar beet seed lots due to cross-pollination by annual wild <b>beet</b> (<b>B.</b> vulgaris ssp. maritima) in seed production areas. A second, minor source of weed beet are crop roots lost during harvest. These roots ("groundkeepers") can reproduce in the year after sugar beet and potentially contribute to weed beet dynamics and gene flow. Bolting, flowering and seed production timing and potential of groundkeepers were measured in field experiments. Bolting and flowering were faster in groundkeepers vs. weed beet; flower and seed production was lower in groundkeepers but the latter were less sensitive to competitive crops. The measured parameters were used to introduce a ground-keeper life-cycle into the GeneSys-Beet model which quantifies the effects of cropping systems on weed beet in landscapes. Simulations over several years showed weed beet dynamics to be more sensitive to groundkeeper parameter values than to root loss at sugar beet harvest. Groundkeepers were identified as a key source of weed beet populations and of gene escape from novel sugar beet varieties (e. g. genetically-modified herbicide-tolerant varieties) in the absence of crop bolters. The control of the latter, either by manual weeding or by genetic improvement of sugar beet varieties, was shown to be essential for controlling weed beet populations and avoid the advent of herbicide-tolerant weed beet.

Effectuated by breeding efforts, modern crops diverge genetically and phenotypically from their wild relatives but {{little is known about}} consequences for the associated microbiota. Therefore, we studied bacterial rhizosphere communities associated with the wild <b>beet</b> <b>B.</b> vulgaris ssp. maritima grown in their natural habitat soil from coastal drift lines (CS) and modern sugar beets (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) cultivated in CS and potting soil (PS) under greenhouse conditions. Analysis of 16 S rRNA gene fingerprints and pyrosequencing-based amplicon libraries revealed plant genotype- and soil-specific microbiomes. Wild beet plants harbor distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and a more diverse bacterial community than the domesticated sugar beet plants. Although the rhizospheres of both plant genotypes were dominated by Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes, 47. 4 % of dominant OTUs were additionally detected in the wild beet rhizosphere. Analysis of the cultivable fraction confirmed these plant genotype-specific differences at functional level. The proportion of isolates displayed in vitro activity against phytopathogens was lower for wild beet (≤ 45. 8 %) than for sugar beet (≤ 57. 5 %). Conversely, active isolates from the wild beet exhibited stronger ability to cope with abiotic stresses. From all samples, active isolates of Stenotrophomonas rhizophila were frequently identified. In addition, soil type-specific impacts on the composition of bacterial communities were found: Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes were only detected in plants cultivated in CS; whereas Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria dominated in PS.

40|$|The species Beta vulgaris {{encompasses}} {{wild and}} cultivated members {{with a broad}} range of phenological development. The annual life cycle is commonly found in sea beets (ssp. maritima) from Mediterranean environments which germinate, bolt, and flower within one season under long day conditions. Biennials such as the cultivated sugar <b>beet</b> (<b>B.</b> vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) as well as sea beets from northern latitudes require prolonged exposure to cold temperature over winter to acquire floral competence. Sugar beet is mainly cultivated for sugar production in Europe and is likely to have originated from sea beet. Flowering time strongly affects seed yield and yield potential and is thus a trait of high agronomic relevance. Besides environmental cues, there are complex genetic networks known to impact life cycle switch in flowering plants. In sugar beet, BTC 1, BvBBX 19, BvFT 1, and BvFT 2 are major flowering time regulators. In this study, we phenotyped plants from a diversity Beta panel encompassing cultivated and wild species from different geographical origin. Plants were grown under different day length regimes with and without vernalization. Haplotype analysis of BTC 1, BvBBX 19, BvFT 1, and BvFT 2 was performed to identify natural diversity of these genes and their impact on flowering. We found that accessions from northern latitudes flowered significantly later than those from southern latitudes. Some plants did not flower at all, indicating a strong impact of latitude of origin on life cycle. Haplotype analysis revealed a high conservation of the CCT-, REC-, BBX-, and PEBP-domains with regard to SNP occurrence. We identified sequence variation which may impact life cycle adaptation in beet. Our data endorse the importance of BTC 1 in the domestication process of cultivated beets and contribute to the understanding of distribution and adaption of Beta species to different life cycle regimes in response to different environments.

40|$|The {{double-stranded}} RNA genome of beet cryptic virus 1 (BCV 1) {{has been}} translated, after denaturation, in a wheat germ cell-flee system. Two major polypeptides, of approximate M r 52000 and 67000, were produced. The smaller polypeptide, encoded by RNA 2 (Mr 1. 15 × 106), was immunoprecipitated by an antiserum against virus particles, {{and is therefore}} {{likely to be the}} coat protein; the larger polypeptide, ncoded by RNA 1 (Mr 1. 36 × 106), is a likely candidate for the viral transcriptase. These two proteins represent most of the coding capacity of the BCV l genome (88 % for RNA 1 and 82 % for RNA 2), thus BCV l RNAs seem to act as monocistronic genes. Cryptic viruses have small isometric particles that contain dsRNA. They are present in low concentration i their host plants, are transmitted only through seed and pollen, and appear to induce no symptoms or cytopathological modifications in their hosts (Boccardo et al., 1987). Virus particles with these features were first described by Kassanis et al. (1977) (see also Kassanis, 1984) in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L., subsp, vulgaris), cv Sharpes Klein E, and named beet cryptic virus (BCV). Later Natsuaki et al.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 <b>Best</b> scan available. <b>Beet</b> yellows virus (BYV) is a filamentous, positive-strand RNA {{virus that}} belongs to the family Closteroviridae. BYV {{particles}} encapsidate a 15. 5 kb RNA and posses complex polar architecture. A long virion body is formed by the major capsid protein(CP), whereas the minor capsid protein (CPm) assembles a short tail that encapsidates the 5 '-terminal region of BYV RNA. In addition to proteins required for viral RNA replication and encapsidation, BYV encodes four proteins whose role in the virus life cycle was unknown. These proteins include a small, 6 -kDa, hydrophobic protein (p 6), a homolog of the cellular 70 -kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp 7 Oh), a 64 -kDa protein (p 64), and a 20 -kDa protein (p 20). It was found recently that Hsp 7 Oh, p 64, and p 20 are incorporated into BYV virions, and that Hsp 7 Oh {{is required for the}} virus movement from cell to cell. In this study, we characterized genetic requirements for BYV assembly and cell-to-cell movement, and determined relationships between these two processes. It was demonstrated that in addition to Hsp 7 Oh, p 6, p 64, CP, and CPm are each essential, but not sufficient for virus movement. These results indicated that five-component movement machinery of BYV is the most complex among plant viruses. Extensive mutational analysis of CP and CPm revealed strong correlation between abilities of BYV to assemble tailed virions and to move from cell to cell, suggesting that formation of functional virions is a prerequisite for virus translocation. We have found that CPm, Hsp 7 Oh, and p 64 are necessary for the efficient virion tail formation. Assembly of the virion tails and bodies was shown to occur independent of each other and likely to involve two separate packaging signals within the genomic RNA. Our work demonstrated that BYV encodes one conventional movement protein, p 6, whose only known function is to mediate virus movement. The other four movement associated proteins of BYV, CP, CPm, Hsp 7 Oh, and p 64 are the virion components, each of which is required for assembly of the tailed, movement-competent virions. Based on these and other data, we propose that BYV and other closteroviruses evolved virion tails as a specialized device for the directional cell-to-cell movement of large RNA genomes...|$|R

Subjects were assessed for blood parameters like-serum cortisol, vitamin B 12, ferritin, iron and magnesium; urine profile included was pH and Sp. Gr. Intervention period was 15 days and subjects were divided in to three groups depending upon criteria of diagnosis, i. e., Gr. 1, subjects (n = 12) with low serum B 12 levels, who were given B 12 injections. Gr. 2, (n = 12) and Gr. 3, (n = 10) subjects resp. were provided with beet root and poppy seeds drinks to be consumed every night (4 h before bed time). Results: Beet root consumption increased the ferritin level. B 12 level increased significantly with beet root powder intervention. B 12 supplementation effectively increased (from 152. 87 Â± 23. 9 - 1375. 6 Â± 804. 4 pg mL- 1) serum levels of this vitamin and the difference was extremely significant statistically (p< 0. 01). It was highly encouraging to note a significant redn. in cortisol levels with B 12 supplementation within a period of 15 days. Mean value of ferritin increased after poppy seed intervention; this improvement {{can be attributed to the}} iron content of poppy seed. A decrease in serum cortisol level was also noted, the mean levels before and after intervention being 16. 6 Â± 3. 4 - 11. 7 Â± 2. 5 mcg dL- 1 affect a mean redn. of 4. 9 mcg dL- 1, although a striking difference was obsd., it was statistically not significant. The max. improvement in insomnia was found with poppy seed drink (63. 6 %) followed by beet root drink and B 12 supplementation which varied from 54. 6 and 33. 4 % resp. Improvement of anxiety as a factor affecting insomnia was noted in 20 % of subjects in B 12 and 66. 6 % in beetroot drink supplementation groups. It was encouraging to witness a 100 % improvement in the group with poppy seed intervention. Significant improvement was noted in the Circadian rhythm disorder in all intervention groups Parasomnia and Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) recovery was seen in all the intervention groups while highest proportion RLS improvement was noted in B 12 group. Significant improvement was seen in sleep quality among all the intervention groups administered either vitamin <b>B</b> 12 or <b>beet</b> root or poppy seeds. Marked redn. in co-morbid symptoms like fatigue, memory function and improvement in scores for quality of life was obsd. Conclusion: Nutritional supplements appear to be effective in improving sleep quality which might influence quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Global {{emergence}} of resistance in bacteria to the antimicrobial agents {{has made it}} difficult for the physicians to find effective therapeutic agents for diseases caused by MDR - TB, MDR-Salmonella, MRSA, Ps. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Candida etc. Since long infectious disease are being cured by traditional practitioners with the help of herbs and higher plants. At present antibiotics, obtained from molds fungus or synthetically prepared have lost their efficacy. The new trend to combat the pathogens is to use water and organic extracts made from different parts of medicinal plants. In this study 30 medicinal plants and their different parts were screened for their in-vitro anti- microbial activity, anti-adhesion activity under in -vitro and in- vivo in rat model, their toxicity and immunomodulating properties in BALB/c mice. Screening for the antimicrobial activity was carried out against twenty different bacterial species that includes A TCC and clinical strains. The screening of antibacterial activity was performed by the agar well diffusion and micro broth dilution method. Beside water solution of Rosa centrifolia (rose) and fruit, leaves and stem solutions of C. fistula was also included. From among eleven plant spices, only clove aqueous extract showed broad-spectrum of antibacterial activity against Ps. Aerugenosae and S. agalactiae and others. The antibacterial component present in the clove was found to be heat stable as the autoclaving of the solutions did not affect its activity. Aqueous extracts of Rosa centrifolia (rose) and C. fistula (Amaltas) commonly used as therapeutic agents showed anti-microbial activity M. lysoditicus, Staph. aureus, C. pseudodiptheroid and Sh. dysenters, S. typhi, E. coli and S. pyogenes at significantly higher concentrations. Four fractions of organic extracts i. e. PI =P 2, 80 MR, EA 2 and ALCR from the fruit of C. fistula were also were found to inhibit MDR Salmonella typhi at a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) range of 125 - 500). Âµg/ml. Methanolic extract of leaf extract of Bombax ceiba was found to be effective against S. epidermidis, S. typhi, B. Subtilis. Shemamin-a novel pure compound isolated from the leaf extract of Bombax ceiba showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria, B. subtilis, Ps. aeroginosa, Sh dysenteri, C. pseudo diptheroid and E. cloacae. Third group of plant products including Persea americana mill (avocado) peel, pulp, Beta vulgaris (beet) root peel and pulp, Porphyra tenera (nori, Sea vegetable) and Solanum tuberosu (potato) Peel, sub-peel and core were screened against several pathogens [...] All the plant solutions and extracts had MIC value > 25 mg/ml except for Methanol extract of Persea americana peel that had MIC value for Klebsiella 6. 25 mg/ml, Proteus 1. 5 mg/ml, Candida 1. 5 mg/ml, Pseudomonas 1. 5 mg/ml, E coli type I 12. 5 mg/ml, Staph aureus 6. 25 mg/ml, Strep sanguis, Strep sobrinus and Ecoli > 25 mg/ml. Formulation of synergistic compound Since {{it takes a long time}} to introduce new anti- microbial compound, a short cut strategy is to prepare synergistic formulations. In this study, synergistic preparations were developed by combining fruit solution of C fistula that is an important medicine of Ayuverdic and traditional medicne with amoxicillin a broad-spectrum antibiotic that has lost its efficacy. The new formulation developed was named as Amoxy-cassia. It has already been patented by the Government of Pakistan (Patent serial number 137124). We preferred the use of water solution as both amoxicillin and Cfistula fruit have proven efficacy in oral dosage in aqueous form. Amoxy-cassia was formulated first by screening with disc diffusion method and further confirmed by the checkerboard titration method and time kill kinetics. This formulation is found effective against MDR Salmonella typhi, MRSA and Ecoli. MDR S typhi causes Typhoid Fever that is endemic in developing countries like Pakistan whereas MRSA is a common cause of nosocomial infections in the hospitalized patients. It has become the threat to hospital personnel, as it mostly invades the patients with knee and hip implantation. Urinogenital infections are very common especially among the women. Another synergistic combination, which was developed during this study, was between Shamimin and Amoxicillin named as Shamoxcillin. This preparation is found to be effective against S. typhi and E. coli. In- vitro anti-adhesion Activity of the Plant Products Infectious diseases can also be controlled by the inhibition of the attachment of bacterial strains to the host tissue. Because once pathogens are able to attain foothold on to the eukaryotic cell with the help of adhesins present in their pili, they survive there by enveloping themselves with the capsule that is recognized with difficulty by the human immune system. They then produce toxins and harmful products, which damage the tissues or interfere with the metabolic processes. Most important step in the pathogenesis of the disease is the adhesion of the pathogens to the host surface through the adhesin present in their pili. Periodantal diseases and dental caries are due to the adhesion of bacteria to the salivary pellicle like S. sanguinis, Aggregation to the polymer dextran e. g. S sobrinus and coaggregation of A. naeshlundii to S sanguinis. They may enhance subsequent colonization of Porphyra gingivalis that is associated with adult periodontis. Organism was treated with the extracts for one hour. Three models were set up for the study of adhesion. First one was attachment of S. sanguis to human â€˜Oâ€™ group blood, second was aggregation of S sobrinus with dextran and third was coaggregation of A. naeslundii Tl 4 Vl with S. sanguis 35. Importance of controlling the dental plaque lies in the fact that most of the pathogens like Streptococcal species present in the dental plaque is responsible for causing pulmonary disease and bacterial endocarditis. The pathogens invade the lung and heart through oral cavity. All four plants studied including - Beta vulgaris (beet) root, Persea americana mill (avocado), Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Porphyra tenera (sea vegetable -Nori) has the potential of interfering with the adhesion of bacteria to host epithelial surfaces. The most significant feature of this finding is that the water solutions of all the plants are playing an important role in the anti-adhesion activity of these plants. From this we can say that when avocado, Beetroot, Potato and sea vegetable is eaten, the components of the plant material get in contact with the bacteria present in plaque and thereby result in inhibition of colonization of bacteria on the teeth surface. Urinary infections caused mainly by E. coli are among the most common infectious diseases. Most of the uropathogenic E. coli can express type P. fimbriae and I that contain adhesin, which recognizes cell receptors present on the host cells. In our assays, we found that water extracts of P. tenera (sea vegetable) and <b>B.</b> vulgarts (<b>beet)</b> root inhibited the adhesion of E. coli to guinea pig RBC thus inhibiting infection of oral surfaces. Most significant inhibition of adhesion to RBCs was observation with P. americana (avocado) extract It would suggest that just like cranberry juice, avocado juice can also be consumed to avoid urinary tract infections with E. coli Type- 1. The result of our study reveals that all the four plants studied Beta vulgaris (beet) root, Persea americana mill (avocado), Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Porphyra tenera (sea vegetable) has the potential to interfere with the adhesion of all the oral bacteria. Those combinations in which treated S. sanguis and A. naeshlundii which showed lower haemagglutination titer as compared to the titer of untreated bacteria were further checked by the flow cytometery technique. The flow cytometery result confirmed our first result obtained. Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) and asparaginase are the two plants enzymes that show anti-adhesion activity in vitro. These compound were tested for their in-vivo anti-adhesion activity against S. agalactiae (GBS) that normally resides in the female vagina and cause neonatal meningitis. GBS infects neonates during their passage through the vagina birth canal. It is one of the leading causes of due to neonatal meningitis. From our rat infection model it was concluded that treatment of animals post infection with plant enzymes like polyphenol oxidase, inhibited adhesion of bacteria. Another enzyme Aparaginase helped in the adhesion of GBS to vagina of the female rats. Thus PPO -plant enzyme can be used instead of antibiotics to avoid GBS infection. Immune system plays an important role in the control infectious diseases. Enhancement of immune system is another important mode of controlling the infectious disease. In this study of Amoxy cassia and C. fistula were found to be effective immunomodulator. In this study effect of Amoxy cassia, fruit solution of C. fisula amoxicillin on immune system specific hurmoral immune system of BALB/c mice employing sheep RBC as the antigen. Uncountable antibodies producing cell were formed in the spleens of the mice treated with Amoxy cassia similarly the haemagglutination titer was highest too C. fistula fruit solution also exhibited immune enhancing property. Thus novel synergistic preparation Amoxy cassia has posses dual activity antimicrobioal and immune enhancing to combat with the pathogens. Our newly formed synergistic compound-Amoxy-cassia as well as fruit extract of C fistula exhibited a very significant immunoenhancing effect in BALB/c mice. This was observed as high titer of anti-SRBC antibody as well as uncountable anti-SRBC antibody producing plasma cells in spleens of mice treated with Amoxy-cassia. Control mice treated with saline showed fewer plaques /spleen as compared to mice receiving only C. fistula or amoxicillin alone. This study shows that amoxy cassia and C. fistula to be an immuno enhancing compound. They have the potential to be an excellent drug for the patient having impaired immune system like AID patients, person suffering from malignanssies and immunocompromised host. It we look at the efficacy of the amoxy cassia, it in vitro inhibits the nosocomially acquired MRSA infection. This is the first report about the immunomodulatory properties of the C. fistula fruit extract Thus the novel synergistic formulation Amoxy-cassia is not only inhibiting the growth of difficult to treat organism including MDR Salmonella typhi strains, MRSA and, E. coli but it also enhances host immune response to specific antigens. Amoxycassia has the potential of being developed into an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of bacterial infections as well as an effective immunoenhacing substance to provide protection against infections...|$|R
