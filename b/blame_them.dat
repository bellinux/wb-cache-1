5|$|Glenn Close as Carrie Johnson, Troy's devastated mother. She {{tries to}} mask her grief with a cheerful persona, and {{continually}} guilts her neighbors {{by telling them}} bluntly {{that she does not}} <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for Troy's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} posse {{is captured}} by Chiricahua Apache Native Americans, who <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and {{emerges from the}} fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's gauntlet weapon or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens which previously attacked them are just scouts.|$|E
5|$|Simba {{returns to}} the Pride Lands and finds them barren because their natural {{resources}} have been squandered and abused by Scar. After witnessing Scar strike his mother Sarabi, Simba orders Scar to resign. At first thrown {{by the fact that}} he is alive, Scar soon regains composure and forces Simba to reveal that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, while cornering him at the edge of Pride Rock, hoping to subject him to a similar fate as his father. Having grown overconfident, Scar finally reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba tackles Scar and forces him into announcing this to the pride, initiating a battle between Simba's pride of lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and throws him into a pit, where he is cornered and killed by the hyenas, who overheard Scar <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for what he'd done. Simba then takes his rightful place as king. When the kingdom returns to its former glory, the animals welcome the birth of King Simba and Queen Nala's first born.|$|E

5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't <b>blame</b> <b>them.</b> The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|Ian Chappell... made {{it clear}} more than once that he {{regarded}} the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! I wonder what Ian thought might have happened if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have bespattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances {{it was hard to}} <b>blame</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut (2006) {{opens with}} a brief {{description}} of past suspicious and questionable motives in the history of American government. This discussion mentions Operation Northwoods, a plan put forward during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to launch false flag terrorist attacks against the United States and <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> on Cuba as a pretext to invade that country. Focus is particularly directed at the previously proposed plans to substitute real commercial airliners with pilotless drone aircraft in order to investigate the plausibility of covertly using them as weapons whilst maintaining the cover of an accident.|$|E

25|$|That {{evening at}} the ball, {{everyone}} makes their grand entrances and the couples dance. Henry has developed a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet. Leroy is able to convince Belle to stop worrying about Rumpelstiltskin and gets her to join the dance. However, the event is about to end early when Percival reveals that he had witnessed Regina slaughter his entire family as a child. He also reveals that knows {{that she is the}} Evil Queen and not the Savior, a fact he confirmed earlier by observing her through the enchanted necklace, and that he kept all of this from Arthur because he would have prevented him from killing Regina. Percival tries to kill Regina, but Robin steps in and fights him, only to be stabbed in the process before David kills Percival. Regina is desperate to save Robin, but her magic does not work due to an enchantment spell placed on Percival's sword. This prompts Regina to ask Emma to help save Robin by using her magic, but Hook does not want Emma to trigger her dark side. Meanwhile, King Arthur does not <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for Percival's death, saying that his action was inexcusable, and admits that he suspected Regina's identity, but says that Camelot is a place of second chances. He later confesses to Guinevere that he thinks that there is something suspicious about the new arrivals, but he has to trust them, as they are his only hope of freeing Merlin and finding the missing piece of Excalibur. Emma eventually decides to help Regina despite the risk, but the magic triggers her vision of Rumpelstiltskin, who warns her that a price has to be paid if she saves Robin's life. Emma ignores the manifestation and uses her magic to save Robin, but in the process it triggers the darkness in her, as forewarned by Hook, with Emma's hand beginning to resemble that of a Dark One's.|$|E

500|$|Rabbits {{have long}} been {{associated}} with bad luck on Portland; use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are {{often referred to as}} [...] "underground mutton", [...] "long-eared furry things" [...] or just [...] "bunnies". The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned.|$|E

500|$|In March 2011, Gorham told Billboard.com that Thin Lizzy may {{record a}} new album in the future, saying, [...] "That's the No.1 {{question}} we're getting from people – are we gonna record some new material? The fans seem to trust this line-up, and I don't <b>blame</b> <b>them.</b> We've kind of jumped this emotional hurdle together. Ricky's writing some fucking killer lyrics, and {{with the kind of}} talent that's in Thin Lizzy now I think we can pull off a really cool set of tunes. At least it's something that we can think about now, where before it wasn't on the table." [...] On 25 June 2012, Thin Lizzy were in the studio recording new material, although it was not clear how many songs would be recorded or released.|$|E
500|$|According to Miguel, Jive marketed {{him as a}} [...] "typical R artist" [...] {{during their}} {{promotion}} of All I Want Is You: [...] "That album was a huge learning experience. I left the marketing of my album and me as an artist up to {{the discretion of the}} label ... I can't really <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for , because that's what they know. But that's not what my lifestyle was." [...] Four singles were released from the album: the title track [...] "All I Want Is You", [...] "Sure Thing", [...] "Quickie", and [...] "Girls Like You". As the title track gradually received radio airplay, Miguel began touring as a supporting act for Usher and Trey Songz. By May 2011, [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] and [...] "Sure Thing" [...] had reached a combined digital/mobile sales of over 825,000 units.|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the sitcom Imagine That in 2002, replacing Emeril mid-season in the NBC lineup. He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who [...] "transformed" [...] each episode into a character Miller has imagined, [...] "provid a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work". Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired, due to poor critical reaction and ratings. Azaria later commented on the show: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} really truthful and interesting and impactful. We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn't do it on NBC, and nor would we want to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn't make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don't <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> at all. It was apparent it wasn't working." ...|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, many {{planners}} felt that modernism's clean lines {{and lack of}} human scale sapped vitality from the community, <b>blaming</b> <b>them</b> for high crime rates and social problems.|$|R
500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people to accept responsibility for failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever I get in trouble, you go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie.|$|E
500|$|Reasons {{cited for}} the failure of the Dreamcast include hype for the PS2; a lack of support from EA and Squaresoft, {{considered}} the most popular third-parties in the U.S. and Japan respectively; disagreement among Sega executives over the company's future, and Okawa's lack of commitment to the product; Sega's lack of advertising money, with Bellfield doubting that Sega spent even [...] "half" [...] the $100 million it had pledged to promote the Dreamcast in the U.S.; that the market was not yet ready for online gaming; Sega's focus on [...] "hardcore" [...] gamers over the mainstream consumer; and poor timing. Perhaps the most frequently cited reason is the damage to Sega's reputation caused by several previous poorly supported Sega platforms. Writing for GamePro, Blake Snow stated that [...] "The much beloved console launched years ahead of the competition but ultimately struggled to shed the negative reputation [...] had gained during the Saturn, Sega 32X, and Sega CD days. As a result, casual gamers and jaded third-party developers doubted Sega's ability to deliver." [...] Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead noted that the [...] "wait and see" [...] approach of consumers and the lack of support from EA were symptoms rather the cause of Sega's decline, concluding [...] "Sega's misadventures during the 1990s had left both gamers and publishers wary of any new platform bearing its name." [...] According to 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, [...] "While {{it would be easy to}} point an accusatory finger at Sony and <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for killing the Dreamcast by overselling the PS2... there's a certain level of intellectual dishonesty in such a stance... 's poor U.S. support for hardware like the Sega CD, the 32X, and the Saturn made gamers gun shy. Many consumers felt burned after investing in expensive Sega machines and finding the resulting libraries comparatively lacking".|$|E
2500|$|There is anecdotal {{evidence}} that many Americans {{complain about the}} presence of homeless people, <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> for their situation, and feel that their requests for money or support (usually via begging) are unjustified.

2500|$|He {{often said}} that even within the narrow {{boundaries}} of the concentration camps he found only two races of Men to exist: decent ones and unprincipled ones.

Those girls would take one {{look at me and}} scream and can you <b>blame</b> <b>them?</b> I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. But I knew I was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me." ...|$|E
