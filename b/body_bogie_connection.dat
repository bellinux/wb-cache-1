30|$|Figure  9 shows that, with an {{increase}} in track damping, the vertical vibrations of the car <b>body</b> and <b>bogie</b> are basically unchanged at a frequency lower than 35  Hz, slightly decrease within the range of 35 – 70  Hz, and slightly increase above 70  Hz. It is thus considered that track damping has little effect on the vertical vibrations of the car <b>body</b> and <b>bogie.</b> The vertical vibrations of the wheel–rail force and rail decrease within the range of 40 – 70  Hz and change little at other frequencies. It is thus evident that {{an increase}} in track damping effectively reduces the vertical vibration of the wheel–rail force and track structure but has little effect on the vertical vibrations of the car <b>body</b> and <b>bogie.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanical}} design (<b>body,</b> <b>bogies.)</b> of the prototype locomotive was by VELNII and NEVZ, {{and based on}} the VL65 locomotive type, the electrical part (semiconductor converters, control system, transformer.) was based on designs owned by Adtranz, including the 460 series and DB Class 145. The locomotives operate from both 3 kV DC and 25 kV 50 Hz AC using asynchronous motors for traction. Main design features included frame supported traction motors, supply conversion using a four-quadrant rectifier, with intermediate DC link to a GTO based inverter, and microprocessor based control and diagnostic equipment.|$|R

50|$|Delivery of {{the cars}} was not easy, as the Hampstead Line {{did not have a}} {{mainline}} railway connection to any other line. Consequently, the <b>bodies</b> and <b>bogies</b> were delivered by road, and two large gantries were erected at both Morden and Golders Green depots. A traction engine would arrive at the site with the body, and would position it below the gantries. It would then be raised so that the road wheels could be removed, and a steam crane would position the bogies onto the track. Once the <b>body</b> and <b>bogies</b> were united, a steam engine would remove the complete car, to allow the next one to be assembled.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} vibration control performances of a semi-active railway vehicle suspension system using a magneto-rheological damper tested on the roller rig. In order to evaluate control performances, a mathematical railway vehicle model with 15 {{degrees of freedom}} is first derived to represent the lateral, yaw and roll motions of the car <b>body,</b> <b>bogie</b> frame, and wheel set, respectively. Based on the formulated model, the design parameters of magneto-rheological damper are determined to undertake a compatible comparison with dynamic performances of conventional (existing) passive railway vehicle suspension system. The designed magneto-rheological damper is manufactured and its field-dependent damping force characteristics are experimentally evaluated. Subsequently, {{in order to enhance}} the ride quality of a railway vehicle suspension equipped with magneto-rheological damper, a skyhook controller associated with an extended Kalman filter is designed in a state space representation. The railway suspension system incorporated with the car <b>body</b> and two <b>bogies</b> is then experimentally set up on the roller rig in order to evaluate the ride quality. It is demonstrated from experimental realization of the controller that the ride quality of the suspension system with magneto-rheological damper can be significantly enhanced compared with the existing passive suspension system...|$|R

40|$|Lateral force {{components}} and impacts from couplers can adversely affect wagon stability. These issues are significant in longer and heavier trains increasing risk of wagon roll over, wheel climb, wagon <b>body</b> pitch, <b>bogie</b> pitch and wagon lift off. Modelling of coupler angles {{has been added}} to normal longitudinal train simulation toallow comprehensive study of lateral components of coupler forces. Lateral coupler forces are then combined with centripetal inertia calculations to allow quasi static lateral forces, quasi static vertical forces and quasi static bogie L/V to be calculated allowing study of stringlining, buckling or wagon rollover risks. The approach taken allows for the different rollingstock lengths, overhang and coupling lengths and allows angles occurring in transitions to also be studied. Wagon <b>body</b> and <b>bogie</b> pitch is also studied with enhancements added to previous modelling to allow study of wagon lift off...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of primary and {{secondary}} suspensions of a railway vehicle on stability and passenger ride comfort. The possible improvement of conventional suspension without using a controllable suspension system is investigated. A linear 17 degree-of-freedom (DOF) railway vehicle model is used to study the vibration response of the railway vehicle body. The equations of motion that represent the dynamics of the railway vehicle were derived based on Newton laws to describe the lateral, yaw and roll motions of the vehicle <b>body,</b> <b>bogies</b> and also wheel-sets. The spring stiffnesses and damping coefficients of the primary and secondary suspensions were varied incrementally in order to observe the response of the railway vehicle body. The vehicle model was simulated with lateral sinusoidal track disturbance using Matlab-SIMULINK software. The simulation results showed that the railway vehicle stability is significantly affected by the values of primary suspension...|$|R
30|$|Track {{stiffness}} {{has little}} effect on the vibration of the car body, but the vibrations of the bogie, wheel–rail force, and track structure increase with an increase in track stiffness.

30|$|Employing {{theory on}} vehicle–track coupled dynamics, the {{equation}} of motion of a vehicle–track vertical coupled system was established by combining frequency analysis and symplectic mathematics. The frequency response of the vehicle–track vertical coupled system was calculated under the excitation of the German low-interference spectrum, {{and the effects of}} the vehicle speed, vehicle suspension parameters, and track support parameters on the frequency response of the coupled system were studied. Results show that, under the excitation of the German low-interference spectrum, the vertical vibration of the car body is mainly concentrated in the low-frequency band, while that of the bogie has a wide frequency distribution, being strong from several Hertz to dozens of Hertz. The vertical vibrations of the wheel–rail force, wheelset, and track structure mainly occur at a frequency of dozens of Hertz. In general, the vertical vibration of the vehicle–track coupled system increases with vehicle speed, and the vertical vibrations of the car <b>body</b> and <b>bogie</b> obviously shift to higher frequency. Increasing the vehicle suspension stiffness increases the low-frequency vibrations of the vehicle system and track structure. With an increase in vehicle suspension damping, the low-frequency vibrations of the car <b>body</b> and <b>bogie</b> and the vibrations of the wheel–rail vertical force and track structure decrease at 50 – 80  Hz, while the mid-frequency and high-frequency vibrations of the car <b>body</b> and <b>bogie</b> increase. Similarly, an increase in track stiffness amplifies the vertical vibrations of the wheel–rail force and track structure, while an increase in track damping effectively reduces the vertical vibrations of the wheel–rail vertical force and track structure.|$|R
50|$|Usually, two bogies are {{fitted to}} each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An {{alternate}} configuration often {{is used in}} articulated vehicles, which places the bogies (often Jacobs <b>bogies)</b> under the <b>connection</b> between the carriages or wagons.|$|R

3000|$|As a {{standard}} of public transport, the vertical dynamic action of monorail determines many problems like the safety of train operation, the riding comfort and the vertical force of rail beam [2, 3]. The vertical dynamics is mainly caused by {{the interaction of the}} rail beam and the <b>body</b> (<b>bogie),</b> and the surface roughness of the track beam is the mechanism of its formation. The straddle-type monorail track beam is divided into two kinds of PC beam (prestressed reinforced concrete beam and steel structure beam), they are all prefabricated and finished, and so the surface smoothness is very good. (At least they are close to the US road A road surface, but because there is no relevant research, so we lack specific data.) The gap between the beam and the beam, which called finger-band, is considered to be the largest vertical excitation source in the track beam, so if we want to study the vertical dynamics of straddle-type monorail, we must study its vertical dynamics at the finger-band.

50|$|Like the {{subsequent}} Classes 2E, 3E and 4E, the Class 1E had bogie mounted draft gear.
