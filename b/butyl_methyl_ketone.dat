Mutual solubility curves, tie-line data, distribution coefficient, selectivity diagrams and separation factor data were determined for these systems. The thermodynamic consistency of the tie-line data was ascertained by Othmer-Tobias plots as well as by Hand plots. From these data it has been concluded that all these solvents are suitable separating agents for propionic acid from its dilute aqueous solution, but of these solvents <b>methyl</b> isobutyl <b>ketone</b> offers the best hope of achieving separation of propionic acid by distribution between <b>methyl</b> isobutyl <b>ketone</b> and water as it has the highest separation factor value than those of other two solvents...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>methyl</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> <b>methyl</b> heptyl <b>ketone</b> and <b>methyl</b> pentanoate on the sodium current of the squid giant axon have been examined. The peak inward current in intact axons was reduced {{reversibly}} by each substance. Sodium currents {{were recorded in}} intracellularly perfused axons before and during exposure to the test substances and the records were fitted with equations similar to those proposed by Hodgkin & Huxley (1952). Shifts in the voltage dependence of the steady-state activation and inactivation parameters (m infinity and h infinity), reductions in the peak heights of the activation and inactivation time constants (tau m and tau h) {{and changes in the}} maximum sodium conductance (gNa) caused by these substances have been tabulated and compared with the effects of methyl octanoate (Haydon & Urban, 1983 b). Each compound shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation parameter in the hyperpolarizing direction and that of the steady-state activation parameter in the depolarizing direction. The shifts produced by the ketones are compared with those produced by methyl pentanoate and by methyl octanoate. The possible role of an interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of the test substance and the sodium channel protein in producing the h infinity shift is discussed. The peak time constants are reduced and the voltage dependences of tau m and tau h are shifted in a direction commensurate with the shifts in steady-state properties. The maximum sodium conductance is not much affected either by the <b>ketones</b> or by <b>methyl</b> pentanoate. Large reductions in peak inward current coupled with little effect on gNa have been reported for the n-alkanols and other surface-active compounds (Haydon & Urban, 1983 b). This lack of a large effect on gNa indicates that whatever direct interaction does take place between the test substance and the channel protein, it does not result in a blockage of the channel...|$|R

A comparison of the metabolism of the labeled dimethylalkane and dimethylalkan- 2 -ol by age and sex showed that {{both males and females}} from day 1 through day 9 after adult emergence readily metabolized the alcohol to the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> whereas only females of 5 - 9 days postemergence efficiently converted the labeled dimethylalkane to the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> Application of the juvenile hormone analog hydroprene induced significant increases in the conversion of the labeled hydrocarbon to the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> in starved adult females as well as in females fed a protein-free diet, conditions under which endogenous juvenile hormone biosynthesis is nearly undetectable.

40|$|The current {{chemical}} industry produces a {{diverse array of}} industrial chemicals {{from a handful of}} highly reduced byproducts (termed "platform chemicals") derived from oil refining. However, petroleum is a non-renewable resource, and increases in its cost have created pressure to convert the {{chemical industry}} into one that is renewable to ensure its long-term viability. To complete this objective, one approach is the conversion of biomass to platform chemicals through fermentation by Escherichia coli. One such platform chemical is <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> which can be readily converted to dienes that can directly replace existing platform chemicals such as ethylene. To bestow non-native <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> production capability to E. coli from glucose, the polyketide biosynthesis pathway was exploited in conjunction with grafting in a heterologous <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> synthesis pathway found in wild tomato species Solanum habrochaites to produce the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones.</b> Cultivation under microaerobic conditions improved titers and yields, and further engineering to knock out the native competitive pathways that become activated under microaerobic conditions led to significantly improved strains.

40|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the pattern}} of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> obtained from the steam distillates at atmospheric pressure of cheeses made under controlled aseptic conditions, despite the wide differences in bacterial flora, led to the suspicion that the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> were being formed as artifacts. This was confirmed by steam distilling cheeses from 1 day to 13 months old when the qualitative patterns and quantitative amounts differed little with {{the age of the}} cheese. Evidence was produced to show that the greater part of these <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> must be formed during the heat treatment of milk fat. The maximum quantities of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> obtainable from cheese and from milk fat, determined by exhaustive steam distillation at atmospheric pressure, averaged from 14 p. p. m. for 2 -undecanone to 46 p. p. m. for 2 -pentadecanone. Some artifact formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> also occurred, although to a greatly reduced extent, when dairy products containing milk fat were steam distilled under reduced pressure at 40 °. As <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> in low concentrations could be extracted from mature cheese at room temperature by solvents or by flushing cheese suspension with nitrogen, milk fat appears to contain precursors which break down to <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> slowly during cheese ripening, this breakdown being accelerated at higher temperatures. Two possible modes of formation of the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> with an odd number of carbon atoms, found in limiting quantity in the steam distillates of Cheddar cheese, were considered:- (a) From precursors, probably β-keto acids, bound in milk fat. (b) The β-oxidation of free fatty acids, formed by the lipolysis of milk triglycerides, and subsequent decarboxylation of the β-keto acids formed. The use of radioactive milk fat from a lactating cow which had been injected intravenously with carboxy- 14 C acetate allowed a direct comparison to be made between the labelling patterns of fatty acids and the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> from the same milk source. The {{similarity of}} the labelling patterns suggests that the C 6 to C 16 β-keto acids and the corresponding fatty acids have a common precursor (or that one is the precursor of the other) and are together incorporated into the triglycerides. Only butyric acid of the C 4 to C 16 fatty acids in all 3 milkings had a higher specific activity than the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> This suggests that the acetone found in steam distillates of milk fat is formed from a compound (probably D-β-hydroxybutyrate), derived almost entirely from a precursor other than acetate. The finding that the saturated C 18 acid in all 3 samples of radioactive milk fat had an extremely low activity was in agreement with the fact that no C 17 <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> was detected in any of the numerous steam distillates from milk fat or cheese. This supports the generally accepted view that, in the biosynthesis of milk fat, the fatty acids up to c 16 acid are synthesised from an acetate pool, whereas C 18 acids and above are obtained from the blood triglycerides. The possibility that <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> were being formed in Cheddar cheese from the β-oxidation of free fatty acids, as well as from a slow breakdown of bound β-keto acids in milk fat, was shown to be improbable. Triglycerides of acids (undecanoic, nonanoic, and heptanoic), which occur normally only in traces in milk fat, were synthesised and incorporated in Cheddar cheeses. On steam distillation of these cheeses when mature, no <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> corresponding to the acids in the added triglycerides were obtained, although the normal range of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> with an odd number of carbon atoms was found in the distillates. A detailed study of the metabolism of fatty acids and synthetic triglycerides by spores and mycelium of Penicillium roqueforti was undertaken, this fungus being chosen as a general representative of lipolytic organisms that might be of importance in producing Cheddar flavour. The effect of the growth medium, pH of solution, concentration of acid and inorganic ions on both oxygen uptake and <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation was determined. The rate of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation suggested the synthesis of adaptive β-keto acid decarboxylases after a lag period of 1 to 2 hours. An hypothesis based upon the possible toxicity of the C 6 to C 12 β-keto acids can explain a number of the experimental results: (1) Only one <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> was formed (2) The most toxic acids were those which gave the least amount of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (3) Concentrations of the C 8 to C 12 fatty acids that markedly inhibited the respiration of mycelium were nevertheless oxidised to considerable quantities of the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> The relationship between the toxic action of fatty acids and chain length was found to be dependent upon pH. The chain length of the most toxic acid increased with pH, being C 10 acid at pH 2. 5 and C 12 at pH's 5. 2 and 6. 0. At pH 6. 8 none of the acids from C 4 to C 18 inhibited oxygen uptake but C 14 acid was the most toxic acid at pH 8. 0. There appeared to be no sharp dividing line between the metabolic activity, with respect to fatty acids, of spores and mycelium. Mycelium oxidised fatty acids rapidly giving varying amounts of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> but considerably more CO 2 than spores. In general spores formed higher amounts of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> than mycelium but showed also a slight but definite ability to form CO 2 from octanoic acid. Evidence for a β-oxidation mechanism in the fungal metabolism of fatty acids was obtained by the use of 1 -C 14 and 2 -C 14 octanoic acids. A relatively slow movement of intermediates through the T. C. A. cycle was also indicated. High concentrations of triglycerides were oxidised slowly by spores to <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> when equivalent concentrations of the free acid (up to 66 μmoles/ml) inhibited <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation. It seems probable that the very slow rate of formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> is due to the inhibitory effect of the ketones themselves on the lipases. Methyl carbinols were not detected in significant amounts as products of the metabolism of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones,</b> evidence being obtained on the contrary that the carbinols were possibly precursors of the ketones during the oxidation of fatty acids by spores. Cell free extracts obtained from mycelium were able to oxidise low concentrations of octanoic acid (0. 5 μ-moles/ml or less) after a lag of up to 3 hours. The supplementation of the extracts with several coenzymes, known to be associated with fatty acid oxidation, or with T. C. A. cycle intermediates were unable, however, to decrease the lag before oxidation started. No <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> were detected after the oxidation of fatty acids by cell-free extracts but were formed when cell debris from the Hughes Press was used. This suggests that the β-keto acid decarboxylases were tightly bound to the cell walls...|$|R
