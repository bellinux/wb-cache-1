2500|$|The New York Attorney General is {{investigating}} whether ExxonMobil's statements to investors {{were consistent with}} the company’s decades of extensive scientific research. The Martin Act in New York state law gives the state Attorney General broad powers to investigate financial fraud. On November 4, 2015 the New York Attorney General issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil. The New York Attorney General investigation includes possible violations of consumer protection, fraud, and securities law. ExxonMobil denied withholding climate change research. Following published reports, based on internal Exxon documents, suggesting that during the 1980s and 1990s Exxon used climate research in its <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> but simultaneously argued publicly that the science was unsettled, the California Attorney General {{is investigating}} whether ExxonMobil lied to the public or shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change, possible securities fraud, and violations of environmental laws. ExxonMobil denied wrongdoing. On March 29, 2016, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) announced investigations. Seventeen attorneys general were cooperating on investigations. Exxon said the investigations were [...] "politically motivated." [...] As of June 2016, ExxonMobil is suing the Attorneys General of USVI (Claude Walker) and Massachusetts (Maura Healey, who had issued supoenas of their own).|$|E
2500|$|Although the establishments {{are legally}} {{responsible}} for irrigation and wastewater treatment, {{they are not}} engaged in these activities. There is no strategic or <b>business</b> <b>planning,</b> nor a focus on performance. There is a limited focus on IT and on asset management; customer service is fragmented. By law Lebanese water utilities should have 4,050 employees, but they actually had only 1,342 as of 2010. This {{is due to a}} hiring freeze imposed by the government. The number of employees has thus declined during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. The gaps at the lower levels were partially filled with temporary laborers. But there are also important gaps in managerial positions. [...] The average number of staff is less than 2 per 1000 connections, much below the regional average. The Beirut-Mount Lebanon utility has only 1.6 staff per 1000 connections. Utilities are thus unable to perform some of their basic functions. The Board members of the Water Establishments are nominated by the Cabinet upon the proposition of the Minister of Energy and Water. Municipalities have no say in the nomination of Board members. There have been only limited attempts to involve the private sector in operating water and sewer systems. A management contract for the city of Tripoli with a French firm has not been renewed after it expired (see history section).|$|E
