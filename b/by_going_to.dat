5|$|By 1209 de Gray was in Ireland {{serving as}} the king's governor, an office {{sometimes}} referred to as justiciar for Ireland.

He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in Ireland. De Gray's term of office in Ireland coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.|$|E
