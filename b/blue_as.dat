Lipsky, Drakken is Kim's archnemesis {{and most}} {{resilient}} adversary; a mad scientist plotting world domination, {{although most of}} his schemes fail {{at the hands of}} Kim because he lacks both the patience and intelligence to perfect his ideas, which often suffer {{as a result of his}} own mistakes and oversights. His skin has permanently been turned <b>blue</b> <b>as</b> a result of a laboratory accident. Additionally, Drakken is a former college roommate of Kim's father James.|$|E

5|$|Encountering MissingNo. causes {{graphical}} {{errors and}} the mass replication of the sixth item in the player's item menu; the latter effect resulted in the glitch's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines. IGN has noted MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and <b>Blue</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} famous video game glitches. Fans of the series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as part of the games' canon, and sociologists have studied its impact on players.|$|E

Ottawa earned its first-ever victory at the tournament over the Montreal Victorias, but lost its final match to the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC) to place second in the tournament.

5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and <b>blue,</b> <b>as</b> well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock to climb up on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big <b>Blue.</b> <b>As</b> the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} installments of the series, the two games follow {{the journey of}} a young Pokémon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train Pokémon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 157 new Pokémon to the franchise, 6 more than the previous record holder Red and <b>Blue,</b> <b>as</b> well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pokémon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pokémon between both of the games is {{necessary in order to}} complete the games' Pokédex.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep <b>Blue</b> <b>as</b> a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
