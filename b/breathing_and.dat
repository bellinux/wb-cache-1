5|$|The breathings (rough {{and smooth}} <b>breathing)</b> <b>and</b> accents (see e.g. Greek diacritics) are given fully and usually correctly. The breathings are {{indicated}} by sigla ⊢ and ⊣, {{often used in}} codices from the 9th and 10th century. In some cases breathings are given incorrectly (e.g. Matthew 9,7.16).|$|E

5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is indicated}} {{in a variety}} of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway, <b>breathing,</b> <b>and</b> oxygenating the blood. In these circumstances, oxygen supplementation using a simple face mask is inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for <b>breathing,</b> <b>and</b> their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo {{collapsed}} in a hallway of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael's 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> had no pulse. They attempted to resuscitate {{her and she was}} transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.|$|E
5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} green mamba {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> swallowing, irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E

5|$|The {{change from}} a body plan for <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> {{navigating}} in water to a body plan enabling the animal to move on land {{is one of the}} most profound evolutionary changes known. It is also one of the best understood, largely thanks to a number of significant transitional fossil finds in the late 20th century combined with improved phylogenetic analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is causing the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E
5|$|The text {{opens with}} a {{discussion}} of virtues and lifestyle of a yogi, with 70 verses in the first chapter dedicated primarily to Yamas and 19 in second dedicated to Niyamas. The yoga postures with <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> cleansing exercises are described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters, wherein the text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body.|$|E

5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis {{are loaded with}} vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of <b>breathing,</b> <b>and</b> they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E
5|$|While Jainism enjoins {{observance}} of total nonviolence by the ascetics, {{it is often}} argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating, drinking, <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> surviving {{in order to support}} his body. According to Jainism, life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of the universe. Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals, but it is impossible to avoid killing of subtle microorganisms in air and water, plant life and various types of insects that may be crushed by walking.|$|E
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
