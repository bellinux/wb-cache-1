40|$|Different ways of {{integrating}} {{of integrating}} photonics and electronics at the wafer level scale are reviewed: Monolithic, Back-Side, and Front-Side integration. Type and volume applications are selection criteria. DEMONSTRATOR FOR HELIOS PROJECT By co-integrating optics and electronics {{on the same}} chip, high-functionality, high-performance and highly integrated devices can be fabricated with a well-mastered microelectronics fabrication process. The photonics chips with active devices are connected to electronics drivers or amplifiers and therefore the integration challenge of silicon photonics with microelectronic circuits has been studied for a long time. Different integration schemes have been studied and developed, {{each with its own}} merits which are often application specific: Biosensing and high performance computing systems will not necessarily share the same integration schemes as the specifications and the system packaging differ strongly. If we consider chip-to-chip or die-to-wafer connections, mature technologies such as wire <b>bonding,</b> <b>stud</b> bumping, and flip-chipping are available. The silicon photonics circuit can then be considered as a board where the different subcircuits are attached (laser diodes, drivers, photodetectors, transimpedance amplifiers, etc…). The FP 7 HELIOS project focused on the integration at wafer level for either higher performance (reduction of the parasitics) or highe...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>bonded</b> <b>stud</b> design {{configurations}} was screened {{on the basis}} of tension-tension cyclic tests to determine the structural capability of each configuration for joining a laminated wood structure (wind turbine blade) to a steel flange (wind turbine hub). Design parameters which affected the joint strength (ultimate and fatigue) were systematically varied and evaluated through appropriate testing. Two designs showing the most promise were used to fabricate addiate testing. Two designs showing the most promise were used to fabricate additional test specimens to determine ultimate strength and fatigue curves. Test results for the <b>bonded</b> <b>stud</b> designs demonstrated that joint strengths approaching the 10, 000 to 12, 000 psi ultimate strength and 5000 psi high cycle fatigue strength of the wood epoxy composite could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} on a root end section of a laminated wood wind turbine blade are reported. The blade to hub transition of the wood blade uses steel studs cast into the wood D spar with a filled epoxy. Both individual studs and a full scale, short length, root section were tested. Results indicate that the <b>bonded</b> <b>stud</b> concept is more than adequate for both the 30 year life fatigue loads and for the high wind or hurricane gust loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{flip chip}} is {{recognized}} as the most reliable chip interconnect method and renders an extremely high production yield at very low cost. Furthermore, flip chip gives extraordinary electrical performance, which is vital at GHz frequencies. The flip-chip interconnect is based on three fundamental elements, bumps on a die, chip carrier and the method of joining a die to a carrier. These elements are interdependent, thus important to consider each in order to select the optimal flip-chip system for a specific application. The tentative use of an encapsulant is another consideration. Most obviously, the gold pad and conductor metallurgy of GaAs chips bring the need for alternate bumping methods. Two different joining schemes tentatively suitable for GaAs chip pad metallurgies were tested based on thermocompression joining. Bumps were applied to the chip carrier, a thin film substrate and were either plated gold cylinders or gold ball <b>bond</b> <b>studs.</b> Cross-sections, shear tests, and X-ray imaging {{were used to determine}} the joint quality...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{treats the}} {{development}} of packaging and integration methods for the cost-efficient encapsulation and packaging of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices. The packaging of MEMS devices is often more costly than the device itself, partly because the packaging can be crucial {{for the performance of}} the device. For devices which contain liquids or needs to be enclosed in a vacuum, the packaging can account for up to 80 % of the total cost of the device. The first part of this thesis presents the integration scheme for an optical dye thin film NO 2 -gas sensor, designed using cost-efficient implementations of wafer-scale methods. This work includes design and fabrication of photonic subcomponents in addition to the main effort of integration and packaging of the dye-film. A specific proof of concept target was for NO 2 monitoring in a car tunnel. The second part of this thesis deals with the wafer-scale packaging methods developed for the sensing device. The developed packaging method, based on low-temperature plastic deformation of gold sealing structures, is further demonstrated as a generic method for other hermetic liquid and vacuum packaging applications. In the developed packaging methods, the mechanically squeezed gold sealing material is both electroplated microstruc- tures and wire <b>bonded</b> <b>stud</b> bumps. The electroplated rings act like a more hermetic version of rubber sealing rings while compressed in conjunction with a cavity forming wafer <b>bonding</b> process. The <b>stud</b> bump sealing processes is on the other hand applied on completed cavities with narrow access ports, to seal either a vacuum or liquid inside the cavities at room temperature. Additionally, the resulting hermeticity of primarily the vacuum sealing methods is thoroughly investigated. Two of the sealing methods presented require permanent mechanical fixation in order to complete the packaging process. Two solutions to this problem are presented in this thesis. First, a more traditional wafer bonding method using tin-soldering is demonstrated. Second, a novel full-wafer epoxy underfill-process using a microfluidic distribution network is demonstrated using a room temperature process. QC 20130325 </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{quantitative}} information on the operating life capabilities of wind turbine rotor blade concepts for root-end load transfer, a series of cantilever beam fatigue tests was conducted. Fatigue tests were conducted on a laminated wood blade with <b>bonded</b> steel <b>studs,</b> a low cost steel spar (utility pole) with a welded flange, a utility pole with additional root-end thickness provided by a swaged collar, fiberglass spars with both bonded and nonbonded fittings, and, finally, an aluminum blade with a bolted steel fitting (Lockheed Mod- 0 blade). Photographs, data, and conclusions {{for each of these}} tests are presented. In addition, the aluminum blade test results are compared to field failure information; these results provide evidence that the cantilever beam type of fatigue test is a satisfactory method for obtaining qualitative data on blade life expectancy and for identifying structurally underdesigned areas (hot spots) ...|$|R
40|$|Highway bridges {{are exposed}} to {{numerous}} elemental and loading issues that are extremely difficult for a designer to anticipate and account for during design. The current state of practice is to design a bridge deck for a certain life span and then turn the bridge over to maintenance personnel who attempt to prolong {{the life of the}} deck through a variety of repair and rehabilitation measures. These repair measures are rarely, if ever, considered during the design process of the bridge deck. Numerous researchers have looked at making bridges, specifically decks, more repairable. The majority of these research efforts have focused on the bridge deck system as a whole. Other researchers have looked at individual elements of the bridge deck to girder connection to see if the required strength could be achieved while making the connections easier to take apart. One of the main components in the bridge deck to girder system is the steel shear stud connection, which is used to create composite action between the deck and the girder. Numerous researchers have studied this connection from a strength perspective, and the strength equations for the shear connection have been codified. Shear connections using headless studs have been researched as well, but always {{as a part of a}} larger deck to girder connection system. The headless stud has never been researched to see how it responds to a shear loading. This study looks at headless studs with varying levels of debonding along the stud shaft to analyze the impact on the load resistance that the levels of debonding would have. Granular materials for the shear transfer of load are also looked at. The results show that, as expected, the headless, debonded shear studs can carry less load than a <b>bonded</b> <b>stud,</b> but the difference in load carrying capacity is within the suggested over-estimation range of the codes that other researchers have suggested. These results suggest that the use of headless, debonded shear studs in a deck to girder connection is a feasible way to make that connection more repairable. by Berndt F. SpittkaThesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the interface between Cu and a glass fibre reinforced PAMXD 6 polymer. Substrate surface chemistry was characterised before metallisation by spectroscopic techniques including Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Chemical bonding of Cu layers (20 nm to 2 μn thick) to the polymer was investigated by XPS (depth profiling, argon ion bombardment) and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The results showed that Cu reacts with the polymer, leading to the formation of a Cu-O- C like interfacial compound, and illustrated the influence of the evaporation pressure and temperature parameters on the interfacial structure and final quality of the film. The adhesion strength of the coating, obtained by z axis tensile tests (<b>studs</b> <b>bonded</b> to the PAMXD 6 with an epoxy glue), confirmed the interpretation of the analyses...|$|R
40|$|Friction hydro pillar {{processing}} (FHPP) {{is a novel}} {{technique to}} fill in crack-holes in thick-walled metal structures by an external stud and forming a solid-state <b>bond</b> between the <b>stud</b> and the metal substrate. During the process, the stud is rotated against the crack-wall to facilitate friction heating and flow of plasticized material for proper filling of the crack-hole. We present here a coupled experimental and numerical study on FHPP of ASTM A 36 steel to understand the effect of processing conditions on the joint structure and properties. An axi-symmetric heat transfer analysis is carried out to compute the temperature field. The computed thermal cycles are used to estimate the hardness distribution across the joint. The estimated thermal cycles and hardness distribution are tested with the corresponding experimentally measured results...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} and analyzes {{the results of}} an experimental research on masonry walls tested first in unreinforced condition and then in FRP reinforced condition. The specimens were three real-scale perforated brick walls. The experimentation consisted in collapse testings under increasing lateral load and constant vertical load. The reinforced condition consisted in strengthening the masonry walls with Carbon Fiber-Reinforced-Polymeric strips bonded onto the masonry surface. The CFRP reinforcement was applied by using three different techniques. The first technique involved epoxy bonding of strips (common application). The second technique involved the bonding of strips with epoxy resin and strengthening the <b>bond</b> with <b>studs</b> (FRP studs embedded into the masonry and connected with the strips). The third technique consisted in the epoxy bonding of strips under vacuum (i. e., using a special vacuum-packed system to push the resin into the masonry as deep as possible). This research aimed at investigating the differences in the structural behaviors of tested perforated masonry walls due to these three different CFRP application techniques. Actually, the experimental results prove that the application technique influences both the load-carrying capacity and the ultimate horizontal displacement of the perforated tested masonry walls. The comparison between the experimental results and code provisions showed that, as regards the debonding of CFRP strips, the latter underestimate the former excessively...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to reduce wind turbine costs, an {{evaluation}} was conducted of a laminated wood composite blade for the Mod-OA 200 kW wind turbine. The effort included the design and fabrication concept for the blade, together with cost and load analyses. The blade structure is composed of laminated Douglas fir veneers for the primary spar and nose sections, and honeycomb cored plywood panels for the trailing edges sections. The attachment of the wood blade to the rotor hub was through load takeoff <b>studs</b> <b>bonded</b> into the blade root.

40|$|Laminated wood blades were designed, fabricated, and {{installed}} on a 200 -KW wind turbine (Mod-OA). The machine uses a two-blade rotor with {{a diameter of}} 38. 1 m (125 ft). Each blade weights less than 1361 kg (3000 lb). After operating in the field, two blade sets were returned for inspection. One set had been in Hawaii for 17 months (7844 hr of operation) and the other had been at Block Island, Rhode Island, for 26 months (22 months operating - 7564 hr). The Hawaii set was returned because {{of one of the}} studs that holds the blade to the hub had failed. This was found to be caused by a combination of improper installation and inadequate corrosion protection. No other problems were found. The broken stud (along with four others that were badly corroded) was replaced and the blades are now in storage. The Block Island set of blades was returned at the completion of the test program, but one blade was found to have developed a crack in the leading edge along the entire span. This crack was found {{to be the result of}} a manufacturing process problem but was not structurally critical. When a load-deflection test was conducted on the cracked blade, the response was identical to that measured before installation. In general, the laminate quality of both blade sets was excellent. No significant internal delamination or structural defects were found in any blade. The <b>stud</b> <b>bonding</b> process requires close tolerance control and adequate corrosion protection, but studs can be removed and replaced without major problems. Moisture content stabilization does not appear to be a problem, and laminated wood blades are satisfactory for long-term operation on Mod-OA wind turbines...|$|R
40|$|Single chip bumping methods [1] are {{especially}} {{of great interest}} for fast prototyping and small volume production. Useable flip-chip interconnection techniques are thermocompression and thermosonic <b>bonding</b> with Au <b>stud</b> bumps as well as adhesive bonding [2, 3] and reflow soldering. Thermocompression bonding [4] requires temperatures of at least 250 °C to achieve a sufficient welding which limits this bonding technique to rigid substrates. The thermosonic bonding of larger chips with higher I/O count is still an issue [5] and adhesive bonding is limited to lower operation temperatures. For most applications a SMT compatible bonding process is the preferred way. Several stud bumping processes on Al metallized single chips are tested or in use. The most common ones are Au, Pd [6, 7] and Pt [8] stud bumping. Au is a softer material compared to the others, but the disadvantage is the formation of Au-Al as well as - if a Sn based solder is in use - Au-Sn intermetallic phases. T he disadvantage of applying Pd or Pt bumping is the damage of the Al metallization or (in the worst case) the chip itself due to the hardness of the bump which directly decreases {{the range of the}} useable bumping parameter window. In addition, using Pd a rapid growth of Pd-Sn phases was observed. Thus, the preferable single chip bumping method of the above mentioned for flip-chip reflow soldering is the Pt stud bumping. Meanwhile, Cu has become an alternative bumping material for wire bonding, but also for stud bumping, on Al metallization. The advantages compared to Au are the reduction of costs for the wire and the slower growth of Cu-Al intermetallic phases. Disadvantages are the hardness of the Cu and its fast oxidation which requires the forming of the ball in a reducing atmosphere. The experimental results for single chip Cu bumping and Cu-PbSn bonding are reported in this paper and compared to previouse investigations with Pd and Pt as under bump metallizaton (UBM) ...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the solder}} flip chip {{interconnections}} require flux for oxide removal {{to achieve a}} sufficient bonding. The contamination due to the residues of the flux after reflow soldering could influence the functionality, especially for RF and optoelectronic devices, and should therefore be avoided. An advantage of soldering processes is their low reflow temperature (e. g. eutectic PbSn 183 °C, SnAg 221 °C) and the self alignment effect. A fluxless solder process with proven reliability, self alignment effect but a reflow temperature above 280 °C is AuSn. The use of gold-gold flip chip bonding is an alternative technology for RF, optoelectronic, high temperature and power applications. The advantages of the gold-gold process are the fluxless bonding, the controlled shape of the interconnections after bonding, the excellent heat conductivity (297 W/mK), the use for high temperature devices like temperature sensors {{and the possibility of}} sub-micron alignment in combination with precise flip chip bonding equipment. Gold bumping which is suitable for prototyping, small and medium volume production can be applied by stud bumping on single chips or wafers. Electroplating on wafer level can be used for high volume processes. The bonding process chosen is thermocompression. Temperatures in the range of 250 to 300 °C and forces up to 300 MPa result in a deformation of the bump on the pad with a material flow along the bonding surface and the formation of a solid metal contact. This paper summarizes {{the pros and cons of}} thermocompression <b>bonding</b> based on <b>stud</b> bumping and electroplating. A main difference of course is the bump shape. Gold stud bumps have a relatively soft tip and a cone shape with a harder basis. In contrast electroplated bumps are cylindrical or rectangular. The aspect ration between bump height and diameter becomes important for the thermocompression bonding of electroplated gold bumps. Experiments were performed on gold electroplated silicon test chips and substrates with bump diameters in the range of 15 to 250 µm. The bonding temperature was reduced down to 100 °C and forces up to 300 MPa were applied. This parameter window is not suitable for the reliable formation of gold-gold interfaces but points out very clearly the influence of the bump shape on the adhesion after bonding. The results will be presented in detail based on shear testing, cross sectioning and DC electrical measurements. The temperature range of the thermocompression bonding from 250 to 300 °C for some devices exceeds (e. g. Teflon based organic RF boards) the maximum applicable temperature. The thermosonic flip chip bonding can then be used. Ultrasonic energy will be applied during bonding as an additional parameter besides temperature and force. A temperature decrease down to 125 °C for gold-gold bonding is possible. Thermosonic bonding experiments were performed with gold stud bumped silicon chips on silicon substrates and FR- 4 boards. The assemblies were characterized by shear testing and cross sectioning. Finally the thermosonic bonding results will be compared to the thermocompression bonding pointing out the broad parameter window for the use of gold-gold flip chip interconnections...|$|R
