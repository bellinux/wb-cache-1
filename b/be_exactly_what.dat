500|$|Reviews {{were split}} on the {{addition}} of Nellie Betram to the Scranton office. McNutt criticized Nellie Bertram, noting that, despite the character's potential, the show [...] "places her into the series as a blind antagonist without any sense of what drives her to these actions." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times argued that the producers of The Office seemed to be using her only because British people are ridiculous and are completely different to Americans. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics, on the other hand, praised Catherine Tate's acting and her character, writing, [...] "Tate's first appearance last season was intriguing, and her stint as head honcho down in Florida was entertaining, but in [...] "Get the Girl" [...] {{it became obvious that}} Nellie Bertram as branch manager could <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> The Office needs to stay afloat." ...|$|E

The Town of East Lyme considered destroying the house for municipal purposes, but citizens successfully petitioned and restored it. The Smith–Harris House opened as a historic house museum on July 3, 1976. The restoration the addition of murals painted by the Connecticut Society of Decorative Painters in the style of Rufus Porter. The website notes that [...] "hese murals are meant to show visitors a decorative style that was available in the mid 19th century and not meant to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was in this house at that time." [...] Currently, the Smith–Harris House Commission, created by the town to maintain the property, has incorporated the Friends of Smith–Harris House into the care of the property. The house is open from June through August and throughout the year by appointment. The Smith–Harris House [...] was added to the National Historic Register of Places on August 22, 1979.|$|E

Eventually, however, public pressure and financial troubles impelled Doyle to bring Holmes back.|$|E

When one of these studios was willing to give Katori a contract to star in their pink films, she accepted the offer. She later explained, [...] "They offered me 20,000 yen a movie.

60|$|First, {{as to the}} writing. If the {{characters}} did not speak in a terse and homely way, their idea and language would be inconsistent with their dress and station, and they would lose, as characters, before the audience. The dialogue seems to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is wanted. Its simplicity (particularly in Mr. Boucicault's part) is often very effective; and throughout there is an honest, straight-to-the-purpose ruggedness in it, like the real life and the real people.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} thus {{detailed}} in sketching {{his early years}} because upon these strange foundations the structure of his great fame and service was built.

It turned out to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the emergency required. Ten years instead at the public school and the university certainly never could have fitted this man for the unique work which was to be thrown upon him.

60|$|Claudius {{was very}} much amazed, and was also {{exceedingly}} terrified at this communication. He trembled and turned pale, then looked wild and excited, and began to make inquiries in an incoherent and distracted manner. Calpurnia called in Cleopatra to confirm her story. Cleopatra did confirm it, of course, in the fullest and most unqualified manner. The effect which was produced upon {{the mind of the}} emperor seemed to <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the conspirators had desired. He evinced no disposition to justify or to defend Messalina, or to be angry with Calpurnia and Cleopatra for making such charges against her.

6000|$|The deepest and soundest {{philosophers}} {{will tell}} us {{that there must be}} an [...] "I Am." [...] That is, as they would say, a self-existent Being; neither made nor created, but who has made and created all things; who is without parts and passions, and is incomprehensible, that is cannot be comprehended, limited, made smaller or weaker, or acted on in any way by any of the things that He has made. So that this self-existing Being whom we call God, would <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> He is now, if the whole universe, sun, moon, and stars, were destroyed this moment; and would <b>be</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> He is now, if there had never been any universe at all, or any thing or being except His own perfect and self-existent Self. For He lives and moves and has His being in nothing. But all things live and move and have their being in Him. He was before all things, and by Him all things consist. And this is the Catholic Faith; and not only that, this is according to sound and right reason. But more: the soundest philosophers will tell you that God must be not merely a self-existent Being, but the [...] "I Am:" [...] that if God is a Spirit, and not merely a name for some powers and laws of brute nature and matter, He must be able to say to Himself, [...] "I Am:" [...] that He must know Himself, that He must be conscious of Himself, of who and what He is, as you and I are conscious of ourselves, and more or less of who and what we are. And this, also, I believe to be true, and rational, and necessary to the Catholic Faith.|$|E

We live {{in an age of}} prodigious machinery, all organised to a single end. That end is publicity--a publicity as ferocious as the appetite of a cannibal. The thing therefore is not to have any illusions--fondly to flatter yourself in a muddled moment that the cannibal will spare you. He spares nobody. He spares nothing. It will be all right. You'll have a lovely time. You'll be only just a public character--blown about the world 'for all you're worth,' and proclaimed 'for all you're worth' on the house-tops. It will be for THAT, mind, I quite recognise--because Addie is superior--as well as for all you aren't. So good-bye." ...|$|E
