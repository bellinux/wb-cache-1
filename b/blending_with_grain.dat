40|$|Common {{buckwheat}} (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) is {{well known}} as an excellent dietary source of proteins, minerals salts, dietary fibre and flavanoids (Ikeda, 2000). Foods incorporating buckwheat are widely consumed in China, Japan, Korea and Bhutan. A number of flavanoids {{have been identified in}} buckwheat, i. e. rutin, quercetin, quercitin, kaemferol, orientin/isoorientin, and vitexin/isovitexin (Cai et al, 2004). These flavanoids were found to be effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels, keeping capillaries and arteries strong and flexible (Griffith et al, 1994).

50|$|The brand was relaunched in 1994 by Glenmorangie plc (as Macdonald & Muir {{had been}} renamed). The {{composition}} of the blend was changed from the original recipe due to market forces. Single malts from the Highlands, Islay and Speyside are <b>blended</b> together <b>with</b> a <b>grain</b> whisky from Ayrshire. In comparison, many blended whiskies contain between 20-40 single malts. The minimum maturation time in a cask is eight years and the final BNJ whisky contains 60% single malt and 40% grain whisky. In 2014 Glenmorangie announced it would discontinue BNJ, citing high demand for their malt, {{all of which is}} now used for their single malt whiskies. The BNJ has since made a quiet exit from the market and bottles are becoming extremely difficult to find.|$|R
40|$|Distillers <b>grains</b> <b>with</b> {{solubles}} (DDGS), {{the major}} byproduct of ethanol production, {{is a good}} protein and energy feed for cattle. The DDGS can be fed wet or dried with animal performance usually similar when fed as wet or dried products; however, some research results favored the wet products. Cattle diets can contain DDGS as replacements for portions of both concentrates and forages, although DDGS usually replaces concentrate ingredients. Most DDGS is from corn although wheat, barley, sorghum and other grains {{can be used for}} ethanol and DDGS production. The composition of DDGS from other grains often reflects the composition of that grain minus its starch that was fermented to ethanol. Distillers grains from corn is usually> 30 % CP, is high in ruminally undegradable protein, and is very good energy source (NEL ~ 2. 25 Mcal/kg of DM) for lactating cows, growing, and finishing cattle. The modest fat concentration (10 % of DM) and the readily digestible fiber (39 % NDF) contribute to the high energy in DDGS. Distillers solubles are often <b>blended</b> <b>with</b> distillers <b>grains</b> to provide DDGS, but the solubles can also be fed separately as "thin stillage " or as "condensed distillers solubles". Protein and energy values are similar for distillers <b>grains</b> <b>with</b> or without solubles but the phosphorus content is elevated when solubles are included. The recommended amount of DDGS for feeding lactating dairy cows is up to 20 % of total ration dry matter; higher amounts- as much as 40 to 50 % of ration dry matter- can be successfully fed as an energ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental determination of variability in permeability of sandy silt soil by <b>blending</b> <b>with</b> fly ash. The grain size, porosity, {{structure of the}} soil, specific gravity of the soil, viscosity and temperature are important factors in varying the permeability of the soil. Permeability is the flow conduction property of the soil. The void ratio with in the soil plays {{a vital role in}} varying the permeability. By <b>blending</b> <b>with</b> finer <b>grains</b> like fly ash in the soil with sandy silt the permeability will vary. This phenomenon can be observed through experimentation in the laboratory. The variation in the drainage property of the soil also observed. This paper includes all the variation in the flow property of the soil (sandy silt soil) by adequate mixing of the fly ash. Fly ash is a major solid by-product of the combustion of pulverized coal in thermal power plants. Five soil samples with different mixes of sandy silt and fly ash were obtained for comparison. Rigorous laboratory tests were performed to determine the individual properties. Tests such as Specific Gravity Test, Atterberg Limit Test (Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index), Relative Density Test, Particle Size Analysis, and Permeability Test were performed. From the results of these tests, it is observed that increase in fly ash content in soil Maximum Dry Density (MDD) decreased and Optimum Water Content (OMC) increased. Permeability is decrease with increase in fly ash in sandy silt soil. The decrease in permeability of sandy silt soil helps in stabilizing this soil and consequently increases the shear parameters of the sandy silt soil...|$|R
40|$|Maize, {{being an}} {{important}} agricultural crop {{and among the}} three most widely grown in the world, {{plays an important role}} in the livelihood of smallholder farmers contributing 34 - 36 % daily calorific intake in East Africa and 10 % in West Africa. In developing countries, population growth is expected to occur with increasing food demand. Conversely, maize experiences post-harvest losses (PHLS) especially from the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), which if minimized, could help to reduce the number of hungry people in the world that is about 870 million people and majority (850 million people) being in developing countries. For the economies of smallholder farmers, better storage leads to fewer losses, more income, more grain available to seed, greater family stability, lower risks of family/country conflicts, improvement in political stability and quality of life. The different approaches which were studied to control the maize weevils included: evaluation of hermetic maize storage for smallholder farmers, effect of <b>blending</b> maize kernels <b>with</b> amaranth during storage on maize weevil mortality, and effect of storage containers physical disturbance on maize weevil mortality. The first study found 100 % maize weevil mortality for hermetically sealed containers and the oxygen levels inside them declined from 21 % to between 3 and 10 %. From the maize, maize-amaranth experiment, it was concluded that <b>blending</b> maize <b>with</b> amaranth during storage reduced maize weevil population growth by 46 % compared to storing maize alone. From the last experiment, we found out that physical disturbance resulted in 81 % weevil mortality. The overall conclusion is that there are effective low-cost ways to control maize weevils by hermetic storage, physical disturbance and <b>blending</b> maize <b>with</b> amaranth during storage. Hermetic storage is the best among the researched methods to effectively control the maize weevils, followed by physical disturbance and then maize-amaranth mixture. Possible future research can be to: * Investigate the possible causes and how to eliminate and/or minimize maize spoilage on barrel walls. This experiment will seek to minimize and/or eliminate molds that were observed and the aflatoxin detected from samples picked from barrel walls. * Hermetic storage should be investigated without letting the weevils to first go first through lifecycles to increase in population. This experiment will investigate if kernel spoilage occurs on barrel walls if hermetic sealing in done from the first day of storage. * Investigate how long it takes for a female maize weevil to bore through a kernel. This test will establish how frequently it is necessary to disturb the weevils. * Setting up the same maize-amaranth experiment (50 : 50 by volume) but having an extra layer of amaranth on top to investigate if this can help completely control the maize weevil. This extra layer will reduce and/or eliminate the maize kernels that were available during our experiment. * Due to observation of no spoilt kernels for maize <b>blended</b> <b>with</b> <b>grain</b> amaranth on barrel walls, more research should be done to quantify the observations. This experiment may lead to hermetic and maize-amaranth mixture methods being used together by smallholder farmers to eliminate and/or mimimize weevils while experiencing no mold maize in metallic storage containers. * Investigate the effect of physical disturbance using larger storage containers. Since farmers use larger storage containers compared to what we investigated in laboratory setting, it is necessary to find out what will happen in real life. * Implement and test the researched methods in a developing country. These tests will help determine if the proposed methods are feasible...|$|R

The recommended amount of DGS for feeding lactating dairy cows is up to 20 % of total ration dry matter; higher amounts- as much as 40 to 50 % of ration dry matter- can be successfully fed as an energy source to finishing cattle. Corn gluten feed is a medium protein (24 % CP) and medium energy (~ 1. 73 Mcal NEL/kg of DM) feed that also contains an abundance of digestible fiber (35 % NDF). While CGF can be fed at higher amounts than one usually feeds DGS, optimal production and feed efficiency of lactating cows occurred with 18 to 27 % of ration DM as CGF. Larger amounts, replacing nearly all of the concentrates and forages, were successfully fed to finishing cattle. The fiber in DGS and CGF, which often replaces high starch feeds, does not eliminate acidosis but minimizes its problems. Corn coproducts such as corn gluten meal (65 % CP) and other modified products from dry and wet milling plants are additional items available as cattle feeds. Innovations in processing technology will likely result in additional products for future use as livestock feeds...|$|R
