5|$|One art {{historian}} suggests {{the painting was}} influenced by the works of Rosa <b>Bonheur</b> and Gustave Courbet, while another believes it was informed by those of the satirists William Hogarth and Honoré Daumier. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the public at large, which led to Predić painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains.|$|E
5|$|The art {{historian}} Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that {{the painting is}} informed by the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa <b>Bonheur</b> and Gustave Courbet. She concedes {{that there is no}} documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time Happy Brothers was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850–51 alongside The Stone Breakers and A Burial At Ornans.|$|E

25|$|At the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 {{the elected}} {{members of the}} hanging {{committee}} included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which {{marked the beginning of}} Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental Le <b>Bonheur</b> de Vivre (The Joy of Life). The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of Le <b>Bonheur</b> de Vivre.|$|E

25|$|After {{the impact}} of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre {{painting}} that appalled and electrified the cognoscenti, which understood the Les Demoiselles was at once a response to Matisse's Le <b>bonheur</b> de vivre (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde wild beast—a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.|$|E

The latter, originally an actress, was married to the playwright Gustave-Eugène Fould (and was as such the daughter-in-law of Bonapartist Achille Fould). Știrbei had been a confidant of her husband, who gave his daughter Georges Achille a male name in honor of Știrbei. Following Gustave's death in 1884, Valérie remained the Prince's close friend, so much so that in 1888 Știrbei adopted both Georges Achille and her other daughter, Consuelo Fould.|$|E

Also notable among her descendants is Isabelle, comtesse de Paris (1911-2003)), whose life, aside from imprisonment, resembled Leonora Christina's in several respects: Daughter of a morganatic union, she lived in exile with and remained staunchly faithful to a faithless husband, signed away valuable property for his sake, wrote biographies of historically significant women, and penned a memoir (Tout m'est <b>Bonheur,</b> 1978) that celebrated life's blessings in the face of life's travails.|$|E

500|$|Arriving in Paris in June, {{eventually}} Rix Nicholas {{rented a}} studio in Montparnasse, which had previously belonged to French artist Rosa <b>Bonheur.</b> An exhibition at the [...] "prestigious" [...] Georges Petit Galerie in Paris in January 1925 was a great success. It led to important sales, including to the Musée du Luxembourg, making her the only Australian woman {{to have more than}} one work in its collection and, according to one report, one of only three Australian artists represented at all at that time, the others being Rupert Bunny and Arthur Streeton. The exhibition led also to a tour of her works to London and British regional galleries, the first time any Australian artist had archived such prominence; between 1926 and 1928, her works were shown in Hull, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, Bootle, Blackpool, Northampton, Warrington, Folkestone, Leicester, Derby, Gateshead and Leek in Staffordshire.|$|E
50|$|Les Amantes (1978) {{picks up}} {{a few years after}} Les <b>Bonheurs</b> left off. Sarah (a painter) lives with the unnamed narrator (a poet) in Provence. Both are also potters.

The man's desire, however, leaves no room for anyone else, and destroys the relationship.|$|R
50|$|A French {{government}} commission led to <b>Bonheur's</b> {{first great}} success, Ploughing in the Nivernais, exhibited in 1849. Her most famous work, the monumental Horse Fair, measured eight feet high by sixteen feet wide, and {{was completed in}} 1855. It depicts the horse market held in Paris, on the tree-lined boulevard de l’Hôpital, near the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which is visible in the painting's background. This work led to international fame and recognition; that same year she traveled to Scotland and met Queen Victoria en route, who admired <b>Bonheur's</b> work. In Scotland, she completed sketches for later works including Highland Shepherd, completed in 1859, and A Scottish Raid, completed in 1860. These pieces depicted {{a way of life}} in the Scottish highlands that had disappeared a century earlier, and they had enormous appeal to Victorian sensibilities. Though she was more popular in England than in her native France, she was decorated with the French Legion of Honour by the Empress Eugénie in 1865, and was promoted to Officer of the order in 1894.|$|R
50|$|Lefranc was the {{youngest}} child and {{at the age of}} six, she decided to become an artist.

Eventually her mother, tired from housekeeping, talked Abe into moving into two suites at the Hotel Pennsylvania located in Manhattan. Margaret {{spent a lot of time}} alone when she wasn’t in the hands of a caregiver.|$|R
