The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon <b>because</b> the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. <b>Because</b> the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.|$|E
