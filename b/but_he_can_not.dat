The main goal of my research was to map the technical equipment, personal proficiency and comparing the professional qualifications of the Police force of the Czech Republic, the Fire Rescue Service and the Water Rescue Service in the range of an appointed theme. I chose the qualitative analysis method. The research group consisted of nine individuals { [...] } members of the researched organizations. They answered my questions very uniformly. I wanted to discuss the relevant topic with the respondents and get to know their opinion. Totally contradicted information was not recorded. Data collection was in the form of interview recordings on a Dictaphone and worked into text. The research conclusions are quite clear. In all respects the Police of the Czech Republic, the Fire Rescue Service and the Water Rescue Service are able to help in drowning cases. Some of these units are relatively well equipped as is necessary (the Fire Rescue Service and the Water Rescue Service), other not so well because of the principal aim (the Police of the Czech Republic).

40|$|Raising of problem. Any {{manufacturing}} processes {{related to the}} generation of waste. Year after year, a growing mass of waste {{is one of the}} main factors reducing the quality of the environment and destruction of natural landscapes. Industrial development inevitably enhances human impacts on the environment and disrupts the ecological balance [3]. Atmospher air is a vital element of the environment. The development of industry, the growth of cities, increasing the number of transport, active exploration of near-Earth space lead to a change in the gas composition of the atmosphere and disruption of its natural balance. Air quality affects the health of the population [5]. Without water or food a person can do for a while, <b>but</b> without air <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> live a few minutes, therefore saving air breathable is an urgent problem. Purpose. The results of geological studies clearly indicate that the contamination of the surface layer of the atmosphere is the most powerful permanent factor of influence on the human food chain and the environment. This problem was reflected in the scientific literature [2; 3; 6], and the second significant indicator of ecological well-being of the region is the number of generation and accumulation of waste. According to this indicator, Dnipropetrovsk region is in the lead, as relates to the industrialized regions. The idea of the article is to consider the air pollution of the urban environment in terms of the accumulation of waste in the territory of enterprises, in particular slag dumps metallurgical production. Conclusion. Slag dumps located on the premises are a significant source of air pollution urbanized areas due to the permanent nature of the spread of contamination. Slag dump of PAT "Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant" is a source of manganese, zinc, nickel emissions. As a conclusion about the magnitude of pollution of the atmospheric boundary layer can say the following: on the border of the sanitary protection zone (SPZ), in the area adjacent to the dump ferroalloy slag magnitude of dispersion of manganese in the atmosphere (without the background) with static storage is 2. 68 maximum allowable concentration. Consequently, the concentration of manganese (excluding the background) on the boundary SPZ more than 2 times the maximum allowable concentration. In order to reduce the concentration to the specification value proposed limiting mass accumulation of slag on the heap, which is 936 287. 6 tonnes...|$|R
60|$|It now {{remains to}} {{complete}} this sketch {{of the growth of}} political economy by a brief account of the writers on the Continent and in the United States, beginning with France. About the time of the founding of the London “Economist” (1844) and “The Statistical Journal” (1839) in England, there was established in Paris the “Journal des Économistes” (1842), which contains many valuable papers. On the whole, the most popular writer since J. B. Say has been Bastiat,(56) who aspired to be the French Cobden. He especially urged a new(57) view of value, which he defined as the relation established by an exchange of services; that nature’s products are gratuitous, so that man <b>can</b> <b>not</b> exact anything except for a given service. Chiefly as a foe of protection, which he regarded as qualified socialism, he has won a reputation for popular and clever writing; and he was led to believe in a general harmony of interests between industrial classes; <b>but</b> in general <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be said to have much influenced the course of French thought. On value, rent, and population, he is undoubtedly unsound. A writer of far greater depth than Bastiat, with uncommon industry and wide knowledge, was Michel Chevalier,(58) easily the first among modern French economists. He has led in the discussion upon the fall of gold, protection, banking, and particularly upon money; an ardent free-trader, he had influence enough to induce France to enter into the commercial treaty of 1860 with England. One of the ablest writers on special topics is Levasseur,(59) who has given us a history of the working-classes before and since the Revolution, and the best existing monograph on John Law. The most industrious and reliable of the recent writers is the well-known statistician, Maurice Block,(60) while less profound economists were J. A. Blanqui(61) and Wolowski.(62) The latter devoted himself enthusiastically to banks of issue, and bimetallism. A small group gave themselves up chiefly to studies on agriculture and land-tenures—H. Passy,(63) Laveleye, and Lavergne.(64) The latter {{is by far the most}} important, as shown by his “L’économie rurale de la France depuis 1789” (1857), which gives a means of comparing recent French agriculture with that before the Revolution, as described in Arthur Young’s “Travels in France” (1789). The best systematic treatise in French is the “Précis de la science économique” (1862), by Antoine-Élise Cherbuliez,(65) a Genevan. The French were the first to produce an alphabetical encyclopædia of economics, by Coquelin and Guillaumin, entitled the “Dictionnaire de l’économie politique” (1851-1853, third edition, 1864). Courcelle-Seneuil,(66) by his “Traité théorique et pratique d’économie politique” (second edition, 1867); and Baudrillart, by a good compendium. Joseph Garnier, Dunoyer,(67) Paul Leroy-Beaulieu,(68) Reybaud,(69) De Parieu,(70) Léon Say,(71) Boiteau, and others, have done excellent work in France, and Walras(72) in Switzerland.|$|R
