50|$|A {{bilge pump}} is a water pump used to remove bilge water. Since fuel can {{be present in}} the bilge, {{electric}} bilge pumps are designed to not cause sparks. Electric bilge pumps are often fitted with float switches which turn on the pump when the <b>bilge</b> <b>fills</b> to a set level. Since bilge pumps can fail, use of a backup pump is often advised. The primary pump is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary pump would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary pump activates only when the primary pump is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary pump free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary pump.|$|R

40|$|Report of {{the third}} meeting of the CGIAR Committee on the IBPGR, held in Ottawa on May 17, 1986, prior to the Mid Term Meeting of the CGIAR. Noting that discussions were {{underway}} concerning the possibility of meeting IBPGR needs {{within the framework of}} FAO, the committee made no long term recommendations. The committee did make three recommendations concerning ongoing operations: 1) that the CGIAR proceed to name members to <b>fill</b> <b>board</b> vacancies; 2) that the freeze on hiring be lifted; and 3) that the FAO provide additional office space as needed.

50|$|The impact {{created a}} hole, {{estimated}} at 1 to 2 ft in diameter, in the Terminator’s aft lazarette area (a storage space between decks). The incoming water flooded the shaft alley. The watertight door between the shaft alley and main engine compartment was permanently affixed open. A cutting torch was needed {{before the door}} could be secured. This process took 20 minutes and only slowed the water coming into the engine room. Pumps to de-water the vessel operated only intermittently. There was no eductor (a type of water pump). The aft peak tank and <b>bilge</b> were <b>filled</b> with concrete (presumably for stability) and this extra weight could not be shifted to another area of the vessel from where the vessel was taking on water.|$|R

The first player unable to capture is the loser; his opponent is the winner.|$|R

40|$|During {{the program}} a process {{sequence}} was proposed and {{tested for the}} fabrication of dendritic welb silicon into solar modules. This sequence was analyzed as to yield and cost and {{these data suggest that}} the price goals of 1986 are attainable. Specifically, it was shown that a low cost POCL 3 is a suitable replacement for the semiconductor grade, and that a suitable CVD oxide can be deposited from a silane/air mixture using a Silox reactor. A dip coating method was developed for depositing an antireflection coating from a metalorganic precursor. Application of photoresist to define contact grids was made cost effective through use of a dip coating technique. Electroplating of both Ag and Cu was shown feasible and cost effective for producing the conductive metal grids on the solar cells. Laser scribing was used to separate the cells from the dendrites without degradation. Ultrasonic welding methods were shown to be feasible for interconnecting the cells. A study of suitable low cost materials for encapsulation suggest that soda lime glass and phenolic <b>filled</b> <b>board</b> are preferred...|$|R

At 2006, three fourths of board interlocking ties were created by independents (Duan 2009; Duan and Zhong 2008).|$|R

50|$|The really {{elementary}} {{strategy is}} to place your blocks behind the Chieftain, but that quickly becomes impossible, as the Chieftain walks all around the board and revisits same viewpoints. The ground level of the <b>board</b> <b>fills</b> up, forcing the players to build upward.|$|R

In Mario Party 6 and onward, there is one game in Minigame mode intended for single-player.|$|R
