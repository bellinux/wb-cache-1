40|$|Increasing {{the number}} of cold-start engine cycles which could be run in any one day would greatly improve the {{productivity}} of an engine test facility. However {{with the introduction of}} forced cooling procedures there is the inherent risk that test-to-test repeatability will be affected. Therefore an investigation into the effects caused by forced cooling on fuel consumption and the temperature distribution through the engine and fluids is essential. Testing was completed on a 2. 4 litre diesel engine running a cold NEDC. The test facility utilises a <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, which draws in external ambient air, which is forced past the engine and then drawn out of the cell.

The pediatric hematology department (PHD) at Besançon University Hospital has relocated 3 times: (1) from a building without an air filtration system (B 1), (2) to a renovated building with low air pressure (B 2), and (3) to a new building with high air pressure and high-efficiency particulate air filters (B 3). This study aimed to investigate how these relocations influenced the fungal exposure risk for the PHD's patients. Air samples were taken monthly in patient rooms and weekly in corridors. The detection of opportunistic fungi species was used to assess IFI risk. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate random-effects negative binomial regression. A total of 1, 074 samples from 29 rooms over a 10 -year period showed that renovation of an old building with a <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> system did not lead to a significant improvement of air quality (P[*]=[*]. 004, multivariate analysis). Among factors linked to higher risk of patient rooms mold contamination was fungal contamination of the corridors (P[*]<. 001).

Natural ventilation is used in some clinics because of its high exhausting efficiency and low non-renewable energy consumption. In this study, a dental clinic model was built using a computational fluid dynamics platform. The objective was to study the effect of natural ventilation on pollutant dispersion in this setting. The evaluations were conducted using the advanced turbulence model, large eddy simulation for the flow field and the discrete phase modelling for pollutant tracks. Three <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> paths were identified, the 'single narrow path', 'narrow path' and 'dispersive path'.

40|$|The light well {{is often}} {{designed}} {{in the center of}} high-rise apartment buildings in Japan. This light well is an empty space without ceilings or floors from the bottom to the top, and this well is called “Void ” in Japan. In this well, the exhaust from the kitchen and the gas water heater is sometimes discharged to the corridors surrounding Void, and the exhaust can pollute the air in Void. To keep the air quality in Void clean, the natural ventilation is usually depended on. The authors have made many model experiments on the natural ventilation of Void to clarify the <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> characteristics such as airflow patterns, airflow rates and temperature distributions. In this paper, we investigated the effect of the size and number of bottom openings with intention to supply fresh air on the airflow rate. If two openings are located on both sides at the bottom of Void, it can be anticipated that the airflow passes through from the windward to the leeward, and the airflow rate of Void can decrease as compared with the case of only one opening. The wind tunnel test was conducted to examine this phenomenon in the wind-induced ventilation under the various conditions of the size of bottom openings and the wind directions. As a result, the airflow rates of Void with two bottom openings are obviously smaller than those with only one bottom opening...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} shortwave ultraviolet radiation on bacterial levels in an operating theatre, both in experimental conditions and during 20 hip operations. When compared {{with the use of}} sham blue light, there was a significant {{reduction in the number of}} bacteria. The reduced level was comparable with that suggested for ulfraclean air ventilation systems. Many efforts have been made to reduce postoperative deep wound infection, especially in orthopaedic surgery. Peroperative shortwave ultraviolet radiation of 254 nm (UVC) was used in the 1930 s by Hart and Sharp at Duke University, North Carolina, and this was the only efficient method among several attempts to reduce infection in thoracic surgery (Goldner and Allen 1973). Since then many authors have reported reduced fre-quency of infection after using UVC in operating rooms (Lowell and Kundsin 1977). The correlation between the frequency of deep wound infection and the level of airborne bacteria in the operating room air was shown by Lidwell et al. (1982), but as far as we know, no comparison between the use of ultraclean air enclosure systems and UVC has been made. We here report the initial phase of a controlled comparative study of these two methods.

40|$|Considering {{the issues}} of {{artificial}} ventilation (AV) in non-homogenous pathological lung processes (acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, etc.), the authors created a mathematical model of multicompartment non-homogenous injured lungs that were ventilated by a new mode of AV, the so-called three-level ventilation. Multilevel ventilation was defined a type (modification) of ALV whose <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> level was produced by the modes CMV, PCV or PS (ASB) and add-on level, and the so-called background ventilation was generated by the levels of PEEP and high PEEP (PEEPh) with varying frequency and duration. Multi-level ventilation on 3 pressure levels was realized by the mathematical model as a combination of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and two levels of PEEP and PEEPh. The objective was to prove that in cases of considerably non-homogenous gas distribution in acute pathological disorders of lungs, gas entry into the so-called slow bronchoalveolar compartments could be improved by multilevel AV, without substabtially changing the volume of so-called fast compartments. Material and Method. Multi-level ventilation at 3 pressure levels was realized by the mathematical model as a combination of PCV and two levels of PEEP and PEEPh. Results. By comparing the single-level AV in the PCV mode with the so-called three-level ventilation defined as a combination of PCV+PEEPh/PEEP, the authors have discovered that the loading of slow compartments in the model was considerably improved by 50 — 60 % {{as compared with the}} baseline values. In absolute terms, this difference was as many as 2 — 10 times of the volume. Conclusion. The mathematical model may demonstrate that the application of the so-called three-level AV causes considerable changes in gas distribution in the lung parenchyma disordered by a non-homogenous pathological process. The authors state that the proposed mathematical model requires clinical verification in order to evaluate the efficiency of this modification of AV.

40|$|Building {{occupants}} can essentially {{adapt to}} changed environmental conditions in two ways, either by a personal change (clothing, activity, occupied place) or by an adjustment {{of the surrounding}} environment according to their demands for comfort. Adaptation of the sur-rounding environment can either be achieved {{through the use of}} mechanical devices such as heating, cooling, mechanical ventilation and automated solar shading devices or by passive means such as solar shading through individual blind usage or window ventilation. However, failure in operation of either, active and passive systems can result in a compromised working environment. This paper assesses window opening and blind usage patterns of a typical, naturally ventilated ‘international style’ office building in the UK and relates this to the users’ perception of the indoor environment. The results show that behaviour patterns and user perception do not always match and are often out of phase. The potential impact of this mis-match on building performance and human comfort is evaluated by comparative simulations of the real and an ideal control situation. Measures of how to address this problem are dis-cussed, focussing on how to support intuitive environmental control without changing the <b>basic</b> shading and <b>ventilation</b> concepts...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) has represented the only method to support life in cardiac arrest. During CPR, artificial circulation {{is produced by}} chest compression while pulmonary function is supported by positive pressure <b>ventilation.</b> <b>Basic</b> CPR techniques can be taught to everyone and used by everyone, which has enabled thousands of lives to be saved worldwide. The main scope of CPR is to sustain life until the reversible causes of cardiac arrest are treated. Unfortunately, definitive treatments may take time to be implemented and have effect, while effective CPR can rarely be maintained for more than 20 – 30 min. Many factors, as rescuers’ fatigue, metabolic acidosis and ‘stone heart’ phenomenon 1 compromise the effectiveness of CPR during prolonged resuscitation. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) represents an innovative technique {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrest, especially when standard measures are ineffective. ECLS consists of a percutaneous venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator coupled with a cardiac pump. This system maintains an oxygenated blood flow to vital organs even in the complete absence of cardiac contraction witnessed cardiac arrest caused by pulmonary thromboembolism, ECLS is an interesting therapeutic resource which has been only minimally investigated in the medical literature. Prospective studies on large populations will be needed to confirm this potential and to evaluate how the benefits of ECLS treatment in this condition compare with those observed in primary cardiac arrest...|$|R
40|$|Although being a {{standard}} surgical procedure since decades, heart transplantation remains {{a challenge for}} the cardiac anesthetist as it requires a sophisticated monitoring and management of circulation, ventilation and homeostasis. Right ventricular failure is the main contributor to early graft failure in heart transplantation. Particularly after prolonged ischemia and reperfusion injury, the donor heart often can not easily adapt to the increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance of the recipient. Therefore, the special task of anesthesia for heart transplantation is to measure and calculate the actual pressures, resistance and transpulmonary gradient in the pulmonary artery bed of the recipient, initiate strategies to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and resistance and to augment right ventricular contractility. After induction of anesthesia and placement of monitoring lines, a pulmonary artery catheter should be forwarded into the pulmonary artery and measurements performed. These data give important information in how far the patient will {{be at risk for}} an increased afterload of the right ventricle and concomitant right ventricular failure. Besides <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> strategies to reduce pulmonary artery resistance such as hyperoxygenation and moderate hyperventilation are compulsory. Inhalation of selective pulmonary artery vasodilators such as nitric oxide or aerosolized prostaglandins should be initiated in case of an increased pulmonary artery pressure and resistance. Inotropic support of the right ventricle is achieved by a combination of beta-adrenergic drugs and phosphodiesterase- 3 inhibitors. The effect of the therapy is monitored by measurement of cardiac output, left and right atrial filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures and continuous monitoring of right and left ventricular function by online transesophageal echocardiography. If the left ventricular preload remains unsatisfactory during this therapy, a vasoconstrictor should be infused to achieve adequate systemic arterial (diastolic) pressures providing adequate coronary artery perfusion. If even these strategies fail to achieve adequate cardiac output the calcium channel sensitizer levosimendan and/or replacement of triiodthyronine (T 3), which plasma levels are often decreased during longer periods of cardiopulmonary bypass, are additional pharmacological options. If pharmacological therapy remains unsatisfying to establish a stable circulatory condition, mechanical support must be established. Severe hemorrhage is not a rare condition especially in patients with previous heart surgery and will be managed with replacement of coagulation factor concentrates and/or infusion of fresh frozen plasma and transfusion of platelet concentrates. Current monitoring assays such as the ROTEM device help to guide specific therapy. In case of uncontrollable hemorrhage infusion of recombinant coagulation factor VIIa is an ultimate option...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the issues}} of {{artificial}} ventilation (AV) in non-homogenous pathological lung processes (acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, etc.), the authors applied the three-level lung ventilation {{to a group of}} 12 patients with non-homogenous lung injury. Three-level ventilation was defined as a type (modification) of AV whose <b>basic</b> <b>ventilation</b> level was produced by the modes CMV, PCV or PS (ASB) and add-on level, the so-called background ventilation was generated by two levels of PEEP. PEEP (constant) and PEEPh (PEEP high) with varying frequency and duration of transition between the individual levels of PEEP. Objective: to elucidate whether in cases of considerably non-homogenous gas distribution in acute pathological disorders, three-level ventilation (3 LV) can correct gas distribution into the so-called slow bronchoalveolar compartments, by decreasing the volume load of the so-called fast compartments and to improve lung gas exchange, by following the principles of safe ventilation. Results. 3 LV was applied to 12 patients with severe non-homogenous lung injury/disorder (atypic pneumonia and ARDS/ALI) and low-success PCV ventilation after recruitment manoeuvre (PaO 2 (kPA) /FiO 2 = 5 — 6). There were pronounced positive changes in pulmonary gas exchange within 1 — 4 hours after initiation of 3 LV at a fPCV of 26 ± 4 breaths/min- 1 and PEEPh at a fPEEPH of 7 ± 2 breaths/min- 1 with a minute ventilation of 12 ± 4 l/min. 3 LV reduced a intrapulmonary shunt fraction 50 ± 5 to 30 ± 5 %, increased CO 2 elimination, with PaCO 2 falling to the values below 6 ± 0. 3 kPa, and PaO 2 to 7. 5 ± 1. 2 kPa, with FiO 2 being decreased to 0. 8 — 0. 4. Lung recruitment also improved gas exchange: with PEEP= 1. 2 ± 0. 4 kPa, static tho-racopulmonary compliance (Cst) elevated from 0. 18 ± 0. 02 l/kPa to 0. 3 ± 0. 02 l/kPa and then to 0. 38 ± 0. 05 l/kPa. Airways resistance (Raw) decreased by more than 30 %. Improved lung aeration was also estimated as a manifestation of gas distribution with a long time constant. After 5 ± 1 -day 3 LV, the patients were switched to PS ventilation; after gradually reduction of ventilation maintenance, they were disconnected from a ventilator and transferred to a specialized unit. Conclusion. The small study group made it impossible to statistically assess outcomes; the clinical results are not at least contrary to the results of theoretical mathematic simulation of 3 LV in mathematical and physical models. 3 LV as compared with PCV applied within the first 2 — 4 hours of AV improved lung gas exchange. It can be a promising mode of ventilation for the lungs afflicted by a diffusive non-homogenous pathological process.
