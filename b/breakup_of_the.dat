5|$|The <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolingian Empire was {{accompanied}} by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there {{as well as in}} Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898–922) to settle in what became Normandy. The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|From a {{conflicted}} {{and unhappy}} childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary output in publications such as The New Yorker {{and as a}} founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics led to a place on the Hollywood blacklist.|$|E
5|$|The album Adios {{was written}} and {{performed}} almost exclusively by Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen. Originally {{the fulfillment of}} the band's ten record contract with Wax Trax!/TVT, Adios later signaled the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band itself, which Esch's and Schulz's limited participation foreshadowed.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the family}} is so ancient and was so widely {{distributed}} on the Gondwana supercontinent, modern species commonly occur in relict populations isolated by geographical barriers, for instance on islands or tropical mountains. Relict forests retain endemic fauna and flora in communities of great value in inferring the palaeontological succession and climate change that followed <b>the</b> <b>breakups</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supercontinents.|$|R

5|$|The prehistoric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago.

5|$|With the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Russia {{inherited}} most of {{its military}} arsenal including its large complement of MRLs. In recent history, they {{have been used by}} Russian forces during the First and Second Chechen Wars and by Armenian and Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh War.

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{investigating}} <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferrofluid droplet under {{magnetic fields}} in a microfluidic T-junction. <b>The</b> whole <b>breakup</b> processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferrofluid droplets under {{uniform magnetic field}} and non-uniform magnetic field were exhaustively considered. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> flow rates and magnetic flux density on the formation and breakup were extensively studied. It was found that <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>breakup</b> process can be changed and <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> frequency <b>of</b> ferrofluid droplets can be actively modulated by applying a uniform magnetic field. While under non-uniform magnetic field, <b>the</b> asymmetric <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> ferrofluid droplets can be realized.

5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Get Up Kids, James Dewees toured with New Found Glory {{as their}} touring keyboardist, having been {{featured}} on their 2003 album Catalyst.

After moving to New York City, he began to attend rehab, a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album, Last Stop: Crappy Town. After another brief tour opening for Hellogoodbye in 2006, he joined My Chemical Romance as their full-time touring keyboardist.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E

5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} some {{significant}} changes to its campaign {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
5|$|Gale-force winds {{covered the}} far {{northern}} Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, {{due to the}} intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. This storm caused blizzards across much of Scotland {{and led to the}} final <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil tanker MV Braer, which had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and unemployment {{of many of the}} weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare.

5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In southeastern Anatolia, the Ayyubids {{continued}} {{to rule the}} principality of Hisn Kayfa and managed to remain an autonomous entity, independent of the Mongol Ilkhanate, which ruled northern Mesopotamia until the 1330s. After the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ilkhanate, their former vassals in the area, the Artuqids, waged war against the Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa in 1334, but were decisively defeated, with the Ayyubids gaining the Artuqids' possessions on the left bank of the Tigris River. In the 14th century, the Ayyubids rebuilt the castle of Hisn Kayfa which served as their stronghold. The Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa were vassals of the Mamluks and later the Dulkadirids until being supplanted by the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century.|$|E
