5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has <b>been</b> <b>cleared.</b> Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have <b>been</b> <b>cleared.</b> With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{modified}} aerosol generator, white mice and calves {{were exposed to}} aerosols of viable Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella haemolytica and the clearance of the inhaled organisms by the lungs of the experimental animals was measured. Fifty-seven percent of inhaled S. aureus <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the mouse lungs, 79 % <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 93 % <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in eight hours. Fifty-six percent of inhaled P. haemolytica <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the mouse lungs, 76 % <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 93 % <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in eight hours. Seventy percent of inhaled S. aureus <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the calf lungs, 90 % <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 95 % <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> in eight hours.

5|$|The {{remains of}} the Muslim army once again sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus {{blockaded}} them and soon reduced them {{to the point of}} eating their horses and even dogs. When they heard of this reversal, the Arab garrison of Agrigento abandoned the city and retreated to Mazara. Thus, by the autumn of 829, Sicily had almost <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> of the Muslim invaders.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> for agriculture and logging.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Massachusetts had <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> for agriculture, {{leaving only}} traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many {{rural areas as}} farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area {{in the east and}} the Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Both schools {{making their}} inaugural NCAA tournament {{appearance}} suffered quick elimination. The Villanova Wildcats were trounced by the Virginia Cavaliers, 18–6. The Cavaliers {{were led by}} Brian Carroll's career-high five goal performance. The Siena Saints were held scoreless for nearly 42minutes in their loss to the Syracuse Orange, 11–4. Onondaga Community College transfer Cody Jamieson, who had just <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> academically, scored three goals in his first start for the Orange.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had <b>been</b> <b>cleared,</b> and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) had <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety}} of tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has <b>been</b> <b>cleared.</b> Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E

5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept.

The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Police {{also found}} that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club {{restaurant}} worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> by DNA evidence.|$|E

5|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} found {{in all parts of}} the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E
5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests have <b>been</b> <b>cleared</b> for agriculture, {{and another}} 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively untouched {{with a variety of}} plants and animals, many of which are endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E
