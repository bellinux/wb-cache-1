Methods: Online survey <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> knowledge using a 50 -item questionnaire {{derived from the}} Institute of Medicine report and related publications. Main Research Variables: Concepts <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> care and common long-term symptoms. Findings: Most nurses reported having knowledge about healthy lifestyle habits; more than 50 % of nurses reported having knowledge about chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, as well as side effects of fatigue, depression, limitations of daily activities, and weight gain; less than 50 % of nurses reported having knowledge of impact on family, biologic agents, lymphedema, immunizations or vaccinations, and osteoporosis screening; less than 40 % of nurses reported having knowledge about marital and partner relationships, osteoporosis prevention and care, sexuality, side effects of bone marrow transplantation, employment issues, and angiogenesis agents; and less than 25 % of nurses reported having knowledge on genetic risks, as well as fertility, financial, and insurance issues. Conclusions: Oncology nurses at an academic comprehensive cancer center reported gaps in knowledge consistent with previous studies about knowledge <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> care. Implications for Nursing: The Institute of Medicine has challenged oncology providers to address cancer survivorship care planning.

50|$|A {{joint tenancy}} or joint tenancy with right <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) {{is a type}} of {{concurrent}} estate in which co-owners have a right <b>of</b> <b>survivorship,</b> meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners by operation of law, and avoiding probate. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs. Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their estate. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.|$|R
50|$|Rights {{that arise}} by {{operation}} of law often arise by design of certain contingencies set forth in a legal instrument. If a life estate is created in a tract of land, and the person by whose life the estate is measured dies, title to the property reverts to the original grantor - or, possibly, to the grantor's legal heirs - by {{operation of law}}. Nothing needs {{to be put in}} writing to affirm that this will happen. Joint tenants with rights <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> create a similar situation. Joint tenants with rights <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> deeds are always taken in equal shares, and when one joint tenant dies, the other tenants equally acquire title by virtue of the terms of the conveyance itself, by operation of law.|$|R

In some jurisdictions, the specific words [...] "with right of survivorship" [...] must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without rights <b>of</b> <b>survivorship.</b> The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of his/her contribution to purchase price.
