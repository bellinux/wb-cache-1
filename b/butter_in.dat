5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.|$|E
5|$|The {{debut of}} deep-fried <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada {{may have led}} to a rise in {{attendance}} at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds of butter. The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E

5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> a week.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the creameries, the local farmers wished to have greater control of their own dairy {{products}} and pricing. Rather than transport the cream to Brisbane for final processing where the vibration of the train journey could impact the quality, the farmers wished to churn <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> Boonah. There was also a strong desire to remove their reliance on privately owned factories and participate in the cooperative movement in the dairy industry that was gaining momentum in Queensland. To achieve this, a local butter factory operated as a cooperative venture was required.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} the 18th century waffle recipes took on names to {{designate}} their country or region/city of origin – Schwedische Waffeln, Gauffres à l'Allemande and, most famous of all the 18th century varieties, Gauffres à la Flamande, which were first recorded in 1740. These Gauffres à la Flamande (Flemish waffles / Gaufres de Lille) were the first French recipe to use beer yeast, but unlike the Dutch and German yeasted recipes that preceded them, use only egg whites and over a pound of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> each batch. They are also the oldest named recipe that survives in popular use to the present day, produced regionally and commercially by Meert.|$|E

25|$|After fermentation, {{the beans}} are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, {{which are then}} ground to cocoa mass, {{unadulterated}} chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today {{is in the form}} of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.|$|E
25|$|Historian and {{linguist}} Andrew Dalby {{says most}} references to <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> ancient Near Eastern texts should more correctly be translated as ghee. Ghee is {{mentioned in the}} Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as a typical trade article around the first century CE Arabian Sea, and Roman geographer Strabo describes it as a commodity of Arabia and Sudan. In India, ghee has been a symbol of purity and an offering to the gods—especially Agni, the Hindu god of fire—for more than 3000 years; references to ghee's sacred nature appear numerous times in the Rigveda, circa 1500–1200BCE. The tale of the child Krishna stealing butter remains a popular children's story in India today. Since India's prehistory, ghee has been both a staple food and used for ceremonial purposes, such as fueling holy lamps and funeral pyres.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} melt <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E

500|$|As cattle {{were the}} basis of Celtic wealth, butter and cheese were {{generally}} made from cows' milk. [...] The Celts were amongst the earliest producers of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> Britain, and {{for hundreds of years}} after the Romans left the country butter was the primary cooking medium and basis for sauces.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} employing starch-protein hydrolysate of amaranth flour, as by-product in manufacture of protein concentrate, to produce protective edible coats on butter. Tests were run on 2 coating solutions. The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate containing 35 % (w/v) dry matter, 30 % (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 % (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin). The second furthermore contained 1 % (w/w) antioxidant (tocopherol). Protective layers on butter were produced by coating with coat solutions. Butters were stored {{for a total of}} 126 days in refrigerator at 6 ± 1. 5 °C and relative humidity 43 ± 3 °C. Tests examined the oxidation course of butter by determining its peroxide value (PV) and the difference between PV of butters with coatings, without coatings, of <b>butter</b> wrapped <b>in</b> original wrapper, <b>butters</b> wrapped <b>in</b> paper wrapper and of <b>butters</b> <b>in</b> paper wrappers impregnated with coating solutions. Lower PV levels were found with butter treated with our coats than with <b>butters</b> wrapped <b>in</b> original wrapper. Coating solutions were applied to prepare films by casting and to investigate their properties - water solubility, water vapour permeability, moisture absorption and thermal properties (DSC and TGA) ...|$|R
