5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> {{the center of the}} log and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|In late August, Seacole was on {{the route}} to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> of control, {{and it was clear}} that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications {{to the north of the}} harbour. Later in the day, Seacole {{fulfilled}} a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell. Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10ft) long painting of the Madonna.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash. Hull then downed a Junkers Ju52 {{transport}} plane and, after unsuccessfully chasing another He111, destroyed two more Ju52s. The transports {{had been coming}} {{to the aid of}} the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one was loaded with supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before <b>burning</b> <b>out,</b> allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, giving off smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø. In the space of about an hour, in a technologically-outdated aircraft and without assistance, he had destroyed four German planes and damaged a fifth.|$|E
25|$|By midnight, {{the fire}} had peaked, drawing around 5,000 spectators. It burned {{uncontrolled}} until around 1:00am, and, in the wee hours, the walls along Flood's Alley collapsed, filling the alley with debris. By 3:00am it began <b>burning</b> <b>out.</b> Nevins considered the blaze now partially under control.|$|E

25|$|On the 16th a bushfire <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> {{of control}} {{near the town}} of Benalla in Victoria's North East caused power to be cut to much of the state when ash and smoke severed major {{transmission}} powerlines connecting Victoria to the national power grid. The 40°C temperature caused a huge demand for power which, when paired with the severing of the line, forced power company's to impose rolling blackouts across the state, including power loss to parts of Melbourne which resulted in traffic problems across the city. Full power was restored at approximately 12:30am the following day.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a big}} bushfire in the Tinderry Range in November 1957 which burnt out 90% of {{the reserve}} and was not {{contained}} until 24December. In January 2003, bushfires ravaged the Canberra region and, spreading from Namadgi National Park, devastated much of the flora and bush landscape around Michelago, particularly down from the Clearview Road toward the Murrumbidgee River. While the village itself was not affected by the fires, several farms and houses were destroyed and mountains of the Clear Range were left blackened and barren. A bushfire which began on 17December 2009 devastated the area east of Michelago, <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> over 9,000 hectares and destroying three homes and a sawmill.|$|E
25|$|At a {{community}} meeting on 11 February, DSE and Parks Victoria authorities revealed {{a plan to}} back-burn across {{the entrance to the}} promontory, in order to prevent any possibility of the fire <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> of the park and into farmland and towards the towns of Yanakie and Sandy Point. Crikey reported that locals were divided on the merits of the plan, some concerned as to why the back-burning had not been carried out earlier, and some worried at the large scale of the proposed burns, which were reported to be larger than both the existing fire as well as the April 2005 fires that affected the park Strong easterly winds on 12 February forced authorities to postpone the proposed burns lest they themselves pose a danger to surrounding communities, though they did proceed with preparatory work.|$|E

25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|E

It was a two-stage rocket that had carrier or booster rockets that would automatically ignite a number of smaller rocket arrows that were shot out of {{the front end of the}} missile, which was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth, before eventually <b>burning</b> <b>out.</b> This multistage rocket is considered by some historians to be the ancestor of modern cluster munitions. Needham says that the written material and illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the Huolongjing, which can be dated to about 1300-1350 from the book's part 1, chapter 3, page 23.|$|E

500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of <b>burning</b> <b>out.</b> For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{stress of}} the project led to the feeling {{there was not enough}} time or money to {{complete}} everything the team wished to, which added to the stress and caused arguments about the design of the game. The developers ended up reducing the overtime they spent on the project to avoid <b>burning</b> <b>out,</b> though it meant further delays and risked the company running out of money as the game neared completion. In a speech at the 16th annual D.I.C.E. Awards in 2013, Chen admitted that the company had indeed been driven to bankruptcy in the final months of development, and that some of the developers had gone unpaid at the time. Hunicke described the solution to finally finishing the game as learning to let go of tensions and ideas that could not make it into the game and be [...] "nice to each other".|$|E

It led to Clyde's arm <b>burning</b> <b>out</b> at an early age, Herzog argued. In a 2003 interview with The New York Times, Herzog criticized Bob Short, stating that [...] "(Short) sure wasn't going to send him down without getting some people in the ballpark to see him. The kid should have gone to the minors after two starts." [...] He also said that Clyde [...] "was one of the best young left-handed pitchers I've ever seen."
