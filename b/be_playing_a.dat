25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other {{producer}} available or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain.

Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> deeper game than he ever let on.|$|E
