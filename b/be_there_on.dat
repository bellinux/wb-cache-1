25|$|The U.S. {{military}} has proposed {{building a new}} aircraft carrier berth on Guam and moving 8,600 Marines, and 9,000 of their dependents, to Guam from Okinawa, Japan. Including the required construction workers, this buildup would increase Guam's population by 45%. In a February 2010 letter, the United States Environmental Protection Agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall, sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs. By 2012, these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 Marines stationed on the island, two thirds of whom would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> a rotational basis without their dependents.|$|E

500|$|As Quartermaster General, Cannan was {{responsible}} for the Australian Army's supply, transport and engineering services throughout Australia and the South West Pacific Area.

He had to attempt to keep ahead of the plans at General Headquarters {{in order to ensure that}} the required logistical support would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> time. Colonel G.

500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
