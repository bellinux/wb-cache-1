5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry <b>began</b> <b>to</b> buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry <b>began</b> <b>to</b> pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion <b>began</b> <b>to</b> come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E

5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet <b>began</b> <b>to</b> disengage, {{with the}} badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet <b>began</b> <b>to</b> withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night <b>began</b> <b>to</b> fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{the suburb}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> expand rapidly with the {{construction}} of many private homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception <b>began</b> <b>to</b> alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices <b>began</b> <b>to</b> rise coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant ice was still negligible in 1880, it <b>began</b> <b>to</b> grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural ice was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants <b>began</b> <b>to</b> become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural ice for the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too <b>began</b> <b>to</b> turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials <b>began</b> <b>to</b> give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block <b>began</b> <b>to</b> dominate building in the major cities and attempts <b>began</b> <b>to</b> improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods <b>began</b> <b>to</b> appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, veteran {{industrial}} metal artists (Ministry, Godflesh, and White Zombie) <b>began</b> <b>to</b> repudiate {{the industrial}} label. Sales remained high throughout 2000–2005; at least 10 million records were sold {{during that time}} frame. Many groups <b>began</b> <b>to</b> take influence from hip hop and electronic music, in addition to industrial metal. As a result, acts like Powerman 5000 are often described as industrial metal as well as nu metal.|$|E
5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning. At that point, a bout of rapid intensification <b>began</b> <b>to</b> take place, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that evening as an eye <b>began</b> <b>to</b> form. Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it a high-end Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission <b>began</b> <b>to</b> receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work <b>began</b> <b>to</b> extend beyond simple grave registration and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{approached}} Puerto Rico late on September21, the wind shear <b>began</b> <b>to</b> relent, allowing Georges to re-organize; however, its outflow {{was unable to}} fully redevelop due to its proximity to land. Around 2200UTC, the storm reattained Category 3 intensity and made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds of 115mph (185km/h) before weakening again. Hours later, the storm entered the Mona Passage and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> once again reorganize. As Georges approached the Dominican Republic, it unexpectedly developed a well-defined eye and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> intensify, attaining winds of 120mph (195km/h); satellite imagery suggested that Georges re-attained Category 4 intensity. It made landfall on the Dominican Republic at 1230UTC on September22 as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes <b>began</b> <b>to</b> grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes <b>began</b> <b>to</b> feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators <b>began</b> <b>to</b> routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
