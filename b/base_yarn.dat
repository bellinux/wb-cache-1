5000|$|The zari {{made before}} 19th century used pure metals such as gold, silver, etc., which was called [...] "true zari" [...] locally called pasa.

There were no innovations to this method in the 19th century. In the twentieth century modernization came into vogue with introduction of textile machinery to draw silver and use of Rubby dyes invented in India. However, subsequent to the Second World War imitation zari was also manufactured, in addition to real zari. The imitation zari was made with plastic as base metal in 1970.|$|E

The main {{aim of this study}} is to determine the statistically significant descriptive parameters that have an effect on the breaking force and elongation of slub yarn using the full factorial design method. In addition, the effects of the significant parameters on the breaking force and elongation were investigated. Slub yarn samples were produced by using a ring spinning frame on which an original slub attachment was designed and mounted. After the samples were produced, dimensional measurements and image analysis were made. Then quality tests were applied to all samples and the results analysed. As a re-sult, the parameters that have an effect on the breaking force of the slub yarn samples were obtained as the slub length, slub distance and <b>base</b> <b>yarn</b> count. The parameters affecting the breaking elongation of the slub yarn samples were obtained as the slub multiplier, <b>base</b> <b>yarn</b> count and twist coefficient.

40|$|Seamless {{garments}} {{are popular}} knitted products nowadays. They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) core-spun yarn is commonly used as the <b>base</b> <b>yarn</b> in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA core-spun yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA core-spun yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA core-spun yarn as the <b>base</b> <b>yarn</b> and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA core-spun yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

In 1946, his son Fuichi Hagihara II entered the company, and in the 1950 s invented a very thin polyester monofilament called “flat yarn” to replace the cotton thread holding the mat reeds together. In 1962, the son established Hagihara Industries to produce flat <b>yarn</b> <b>based</b> on equipment he developed and built. Today, the company – still managed by the Hagihara family – produces {{a wide range of}} products for industrial uses <b>based</b> on flat <b>yarn.</b> It has two divisions: the synthetic resinprocessed product division makes and sells processed synthetic-resin related products <b>based</b> on flat <b>yarn,</b> and comprises about three-quarters of sales; and the machinery product division designs, manufactures, and sells automation equipment such as slit and winder machinery, a quarter of sales. Its two main strengths are its commitment to innovation and maintenance of a strong corporate culture, emphasizing quality, close working relationships, interdependence, and a widespread feeling of ownership by the workers.

Results point out that evaluation of yarn mass, with this approach, is feasible in the 1 -mm range, allowing online measurement (1 -mm yarn mass) in a spinning frame for real-time control.
