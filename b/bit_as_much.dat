[...] GameSpot praised the Virtual Console release as well, especially its graphics, stating, [...] "Visually, the developers made the best of the system's limited color palette and employed every graphical trick they could to make the game look snazzy. Ristar and his enemies have a good variety of animations, but what you'll probably notice the most are the colorful, multilayered backgrounds that constantly flaunt animated details in the form of moving clouds, falling debris, and rampaging creatures that have a habit of hurling things at you from a distance." [...] NintendoLife scored it at 9/10 and referred to the game {{as one of the best}} of the system in regards to graphics, animation, and gameplay, stating [...] "Ristar proves that taking a radical approach to play control in a platformer can sometimes really pay off in the end.

According to our measurements, the {{communication}} energy per <b>bit</b> can be <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 6 x higher when the signal is weak than when it is strong. To realize energy savings, applications must preferentially communicate when the signal is strong, either by deferring non-urgent communication or by advancing anticipated communication to coincide with periods of strong signal. Allowing applications to perform such scheduling requires predicting signal strength, so that opportunities for energy-efficient communication can be anticipated. Furthermore, such prediction must be performed at little energy cost. In this paper, we make several contributions towards a practical system for energy-aware cellular data scheduling called Bartendr. First, we establish, via measurements, the relationship between signal strength and power consumption. Second, we show that location alone {{is not sufficient to}} predict signal strength and motivate the use of tracks to enable effective prediction. Finally, we develop energy-aware scheduling algorithms for different workloads—syncing and streaming—and evaluate these via simulation driven by traces obtained during actual drives, demonstrating energy savings of up to 60 %.
