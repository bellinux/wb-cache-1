500|$|Hadden Frost (Calgary Bay, fell at the 4th fence): [...] "He {{jumped the}} fence fine, but landed a bit steep, which any horse could do. We were just behind Ballabriggs {{at the time}} so {{we were in the}} right place. Maybe we'll come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> again." ...|$|E
500|$|Black and Hartman welcomed {{their first}} child, Lily Pearl Black, in May 2001. [...] Black took a three-year {{break from the}} music {{industry}} {{to stay home with}} his daughter. [...] He explained that [...] "it ended up not being a smart career move, but it was a real smart dad move. … [...] I wouldn't go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to do anything for my career in exchange for that." ...|$|E

500|$|After half time, Dortmund {{were handed}} a {{way back into}} the match when Márcio Amoroso was brought down by Patrick Paauwe. Paauwe was spared Kohler's fate as he only {{received}} a yellow card. Amoroso scored the following penalty and the score was 2–1. Two minutes later, Amoroso was cautioned for diving in an attempt to win another spot kick. Just three minutes after Dortmund scored, Jon Dahl Tomasson who was playing his last game for Feyenoord before his move to Milan, [...] scored after beating the offside trap, and being put through by Shinji Ono. Dortmund once again found a {{way back into the}} match when Jan Koller volleyed home his shot from 25 metres on 58 minutes, after capitalizing on a weak defensive header. [...] Dortmund now assumed the ascendancy with attack after attack, whilst Feyenoord seemed content to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to see the game out. Dortmund tried everything to find the equaliser replacing Lars Ricken with Jörg Heinrich, and Ewerthon was replaced by Otto Addo, however it was to no avail as Feyenoord saw the game out to win 3–2 and continue their streak of never losing a European final.|$|E
2500|$|... "Get Along" [...] {{deals with}} the damage inflicted by religious, racial and {{cultural}} intolerance, asking why the world can't just get along. It is a stripped back track with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Sebastian explained why he wrote the song, [...] "It sends your brain into overload when you are expecting your first child. It definitely makes you take a step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to gain some perspective on this world we live in". [...] "Big Bad World" [...] was written for his son Hudson {{who was born in}} March 2012. He said, [...] "It's about that promise we all make to our kids, but realise we don't have as much control as we think. We want to protect them from the big bad world, but the promise matters the most." [...] "Used to You" [...] is a song Sebastian wrote for his wife Jules. He said, [...] "I always say to her, 'I don't get used to you'. I still get back from tours and I'm still excited to see her. [...] We've been friends for 18 years, together for 13 years. I'm lucky".|$|E

60|$|Amyas was unjust in {{his last}} words. Don Guzman, as if by miracle, had been only {{slightly}} wounded; and seeing his men run, had rushed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to rally them, but was borne away by the fugitives.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's busy. Come on, now, you--" [...] Babbitt reared over him. The {{attendant}} hastily {{changed to}} a coaxing [...] "You can come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to-morrow. Probably the poor guy is off his nut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] murmured Jessy, [...] "you are {{the kind}} we don't mind taking in. The others go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to forget us, or abuse us. But you haven't given me very much {{information}} yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Betts, {{not more}} than a day or so. Now, do not look so distressed. I do not go back as a prisoner. Myeerah and I can often come and visit you. But just now I want to get <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to prevent the Delawares from urging Tarhe to war." ...|$|E
60|$|Billy complied, {{touching}} {{the point of}} her chin with his knuckles. With both {{her hands on his}} arm, she shored it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to draw it forward sharply in similitude of a punch. But Billy withstrained her.|$|R

6000|$|The young, pimply-faced {{fellow was}} vexed by this job his {{governor}} had sprung on him. It {{was the cause}} of his missing an appointment for that afternoon with a certain young lady.

6000|$|... "It's possible. All the same, I haven't tried {{my power}} and don't trust myself. Dick and I would jar, and when I couldn't move him I expect I'd get savage and {{turn down the}} job. When I have done some useful work, for example, cleared a ranch, got {{confidence}} and know my strength, I'll go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to take my proper part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} North Wind, [...] "I {{know where it}} is. I once blew an aspen leaf there, but I was so tired that for many days {{afterward}} I {{was not able to}} blow at all.

60|$|He {{was still}} saying it, over and over,--demanding, entreating, threatening, {{to know if}} it wanted any more,--when he felt the fellows of his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> to put his coat on him. And then came a sudden rush of {{blackness}} and oblivion.|$|R

60|$|But having again {{cleared my}} {{conscience}} of my merely political and possibly unpopular opinion, I will again cast <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> {{to treat the}} matter in a slower and more sympathetic style; attempt to trace the real roots of woman's position in the western state, and the causes of our existing traditions or perhaps prejudices upon the point. And for this purpose it is again necessary to travel far from the modern topic, the mere Suffragette of today, and {{to go back to}} subjects which, though much more old, are, I think, considerably more fresh.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} {{that in the}} street they had several times passed a dingy house, apparently empty, with bills in the windows, announcing that it was to let. The bills, as a variety in the funeral procession, almost amounted to a decoration. Perhaps because they kept the house separated in his mind, or perhaps because Mr Meagles and himself had twice agreed in passing, 'It is clear she don't live there,' Clennam now proposed that they should go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> that house before finally going away. Mr Meagles agreed, and back they went.|$|E

6000|$|His {{room was}} {{in the group of}} cabins on the upper deck; he had already missed his way to it once by mistaking the {{corridor}} which it opened into; and he was not sure that he was not blundering again when he peered down the narrow passage where he supposed it was. A lady was standing at an open state-room door, resting her hands against the jambs and leaning forward with her head within and talking to some one there. Before he could draw <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> another corridor he heard her say: [...] "Perhaps he's some young man, and wouldn't care." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} {{they were gone}} round the corner, and he was left {{standing}} before the provision man's, with his packages in his hand. It {{did not come to}} him till he had transacted his business within, and was on his way home, that he had been very impolite not to ask if he might not see them home. He did not know but he ought to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to find them, and apologise for his rudeness, and yet he did not see how he could do that, either; he had no excuse for it; he was afraid it would seem queer, and make them laugh. Besides, he had those things for Miss Vane, and the cook wanted some of them at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate all {{change as}} a rule," [...] said Fitzgibbon; [...] "but, upon my word, we ought to alter that. When a fellow has got a crumb of comfort, after waiting for it years and years, and perhaps {{spending}} thousands in elections, {{he has to go}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> his hand again at the last moment, merely in obedience to some antiquated prejudice. Look at poor Jack Bond,--the best friend I ever had in the world. He was wrecked upon that rock for ever. He spent every shilling he had in contesting Romford three times running,--and three times running he got in. Then they made him Vice-Comptroller of the Granaries, and I'm shot if he didn't get spilt at Romford on standing for his re-election!" ...|$|E

Tom hits the top of the beam and falls to the ground. Jerry waves and whistles at the cat.|$|R
5000|$|Bowra {{had learned}} the value of verse during the First World War.

60|$|Outside {{the rain}} poured down more {{directly}} and powerfully {{as the wind}} fell {{in the early hours}} of the morning. The aster was beaten to the earth. The child's bucket was half-full of rainwater; and the opal-shelled crab slowly circled round the bottom, trying with its weakly legs to climb the steep side; <b>trying</b> again <b>and</b> falling <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> again <b>and</b> again.|$|R
