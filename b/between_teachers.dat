5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on oneself as a teacher and <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E

Thirty-seven full-time secondary physical education teachers employed during the spring of 1985 in the Pasadena Unified School District participated as subjects in the study. Job satisfaction was measured using a modified Brayfield-Rothe Job Satisfaction Index. Self-esteem was measured using Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale. Attitudes toward students were measured with Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum's Semantic Differential. Null hypotheses were stated to analyze the problem. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant relationship <b>between</b> <b>teacher</b> job satisfaction and <b>teacher</b> self-esteem, <b>between</b> <b>teacher</b> job satisfaction and teacher attitudes toward students, and <b>between</b> <b>teacher</b> self-esteem and teacher attitudes toward students. It was also hypothesized that there would be no significant differences between male and female physical education teachers regarding job satisfaction, self-esteem, or attitudes toward students. There was not a significant relationship <b>between</b> <b>teacher</b> job satisfaction and self-esteem but there was a significant relationship <b>between</b> <b>teacher</b> job satisfaction and attitudes toward students, and <b>between</b> <b>teacher</b> self-esteem and attitudes toward students.

In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> and pupils.

2500|$|Self-determination is {{the ability}} to make choices and {{exercise}} a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of [...] "helpless learning". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try.
