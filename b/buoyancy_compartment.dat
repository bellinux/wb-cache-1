50|$|A Glass Reinforced Plastic {{version was}} {{introduced}} in 1965 and was similar in layout to the wooden boat. Over two thousand copies of this model were made and many are still in use through the world. In contrast to other GRP models, this version has a large hatch to the forward <b>buoyancy</b> <b>compartment</b> useful for stowage when cruising, and a forward bulkhead extending {{right up to the}} foredeck level. The Mark I has no side buoyancy, and consequently does not suffer from a tendency to invert when capsized that plagued later models. The Mark I was also available as a composite model with a GRP hull and bulkheads but plywood fore- and side-decks.|$|E
50|$|The Mark II was {{introduced}} in 1974 supposedly as an improvement. The front and rear buoyancy tanks were built into the hull before bonding on the deck. The forward <b>buoyancy</b> <b>compartment</b> has a gap above it and under the foredeck. This would have been useful for a spinnaker chute, but class regulations of the time did not allow that. The forward compartment had a small circular inspection hatch thus removing much of the useful dry stowage space. Side buoyancy compartments gave this model a tendency to invert, and those owned by sailing schools soon sported socks filled with polystyrene to provide a righting moment when capsized. Reduced clearance under the thwart made this boat uncomfortable to sleep in.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark is a {{single-hander}} {{class of}} small sailing dinghy. The design in plywood {{came from the}} pen of Billy Morton from Morton's Yacht Supplies, Priory Road, Hollywood, Belfast Northern Ireland. It {{first appeared in the}} 1964, in competition with the OK dinghy but before the Laser. At least 100 boats were built by Morton. Her performance is slower than an OK upwind due to her lighter weight (130lbs.) and shorter length. The Mark is 12 ft in length, with forward and side buoyancy compartments. A 19 ft free standing rotating mast stepped far forward in the front <b>buoyancy</b> <b>compartment</b> supports a mainsail which features a MK symbol to identify the boat. In 1966 the fibreglass Mark was introduced with no.100 called 'Fymark.' ...|$|E
50|$|The P-Class was {{designed}} by New Zealand civil engineer, Harry Highet, as a simple vessel in which {{children and young people}} could learn to sail. It is a 2.13 metre long, slab sided, v bottom single hull, single sail Bermuda rigged dinghy, and is designed to be sailed by one person. The low aspect ratio Bermudan rig took over from a gunter rig in the 1950s. The boom overhangs the stern of the boat. It has a small deep cockpit {{with the rest of the}} hull making water tight <b>buoyancy</b> <b>compartments.</b> When capsized the boat floats very high in the water. The hull has a minimum weight of 90 lbs so is very solid. Even 40-year-old boats can be bought in good condition.|$|R
50|$|This was the {{original}} wooden Wayfarer designed in 1957 to be manufactured by Small Craft Limited and also by amateur builders working fromauthorised kits, using the measured templates and jigs supplied, with a hull and deck made from plywood. Frank Dye's famous W48 Wanderer was of course of this type, a testament to its robust construction. The boat {{is now in the}} collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth. Other boats of this model are still racing after 50 years, and new ones can still be purchased today (on a custom basis) from Porter Brothers. The hull is of a 'three plank' construction, that is with two chines. This provides a good compromise between stability and ease of construction. Both forward and aft <b>buoyancy</b> <b>compartments</b> are fitted with large watertight hatches and this provides ample stowage space for cruising. The large floor space with flat floorboards and good clearance under thwart makes the Mark I a comfortable boat for two people to sleep in, when a boom-tent is erected for shelter. The mast is held in a tabernacle, which when rigged with a tackle on the forestay allows the mast to be lowered to pass beneath bridges. This feature was retained in subsequent models, as was the hull shape.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} ships, such as certain heavy lift vessels, can {{intentionally}} flood their own hulls or tanks within their hulls, to sink below the water, and then pump {{all of the}} water back out and re-float themselves with the salvaged object on deck. Similarly, submersibles and submarines also produce negative <b>buoyancy</b> by allowing <b>compartments</b> (called [...] "ballast tanks") to flood.|$|R
2500|$|In 1952, Alfred A. Mikalow {{constructed}} an ADS employing {{ball and}} socket joints, specifically {{for the purpose of}} locating and salvaging sunken treasure. The suit was reportedly capable of diving to depths of [...] and was used successfully to dive on the sunken vessel SS City of Rio de Janeiro in [...] of water near Fort Point, San Francisco. Mikalow's suit had various interchangeable instruments which could be mounted {{on the end of the}} arms in place of the usual manipulators. It carried seven 90-cubic foot high pressure cylinders to provide breathing gas and control <b>buoyancy.</b> The ballast <b>compartment</b> covered the gas cylinders. For communication, the suit used hydrophones.|$|R
5000|$|The still heavily {{radioactive}} reactor compartment {{can then}} be cut away. (Most Russian submarines have two reactors, [...] "in separate rooms, {{but in the same}} compartment.") Due to a lack of land storage facilities, two adjoining emptied compartments, one forward and one aft, are usually cut off as well to provide buoyancy for storage on water. In some cases, however, only the reactor compartment is removed, and pontoons attached to keep it afloat. A third method involves filling the reactor compartment with polystyrene for <b>buoyancy.</b> [...] "Reactor <b>compartments</b> from Polyarny and other shipyards at the Kola Peninsula and in Severodvinsk, Arkhangelsk county, are towed to Sayda Bay".|$|R
