5|$|On {{its return}} to base, the {{expedition}} {{learned of the}} presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales, 200miles (320km) to their east. Scott conceded that his ponies would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen's cold-tolerant dog teams for the pole, and also acknowledged that the Norwegian's base was closer to the pole by 60 miles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that point, about half a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning that he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E

5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> construction {{by the end of the}} 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of East Harlem, who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E
5|$|Johor Bahru {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} cities in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Tertiary-based industry dominates the economy with thousands of Singaporeans and Indonesians and other international tourists visiting the city. It is the centre of financial services, commerce and retail, arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The city has a very close economic relationship with Singapore as many Singaporeans frequently visit for shopping, entertainment, and dining which increase the city income with the stronger Singapore dollar; some Singaporeans have also chosen to live in the city. Due to this, Johor Bahru's retail scene was continuously developed {{to meet the needs of}} its consumers. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. A large numbers of the city's residents work in Singapore, where the salaries are higher than in Malaysia. The presence of Singaporean and Chinese-owned companies were also significant, with China being the fifth largest investor in Iskandar Malaysia after Singapore, the United States, Spain and Japan as of September 2014. In 2014, the sudden change of weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday by the Sultan of Johor had a relatively small impact to the city economy, with business especially affected. However, it boosted the tourism industry as the holidays would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> earlier on Sunday, attracting more tourists from Singapore. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous conferences, congress and trade fairs, such as the Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing and the World Islamic Economic Forum. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a low-carbon economy.|$|E

25|$|Priority at the pole: Scott {{wrote that}} Amundsen's dogs seriously {{threatened}} his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> {{earlier in the}} season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Mancebo of the French team , who {{finished}} fourth {{last year and}} sixth the year before, was also suspended by his team, and subsequently announced his retirement. Alexander Vinokourov {{would have been the}} only returning rider with a top-five finish from last year's race. However, his team, , was forced {{to pull out of the}} race because they would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> with the minimum of six riders. As a result of the drug scandal, many believed Spaniard Alejandro Valverde (Caisse d'Épargne), or the Americans Floyd Landis (Phonak), Levi Leipheimer (Gerolsteiner), or Australian Cadel Evans (Davitamon-Lotto) would probably win the race.|$|E

Among those who have contributed to the movement are Mr F. Galton, Prof. H. Sidgwick, Mr A. J. Balfour, Mr R. B. Haldane, Sir John Lubbock, Mr Shadworth Hodgson and Dr Savage. It is hoped that the name of George Croom Robertson may in some way be connected with the laboratory. It is further hoped that Dr W. H. R.

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of May 2, Hooker began to realize that Lee's actions on May 1 had not been {{constrained}} by the threat of Sedgwick's force at Fredericksburg, so no further deception was needed on that front. He decided to summon the I Corps of Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds to reinforce his lines at Chancellorsville. His intent was that Reynolds would form up {{to the right of the}} XI Corps and anchor the Union right flank on the Rapidan River. Given the communications chaos of May 1, Hooker was under the mistaken impression that Sedgwick had withdrawn back across the Rappahannock and, based on this, that the VI Corps should remain on the north bank of the river across from the town, where it could protect the army's supplies and supply line. (In fact, both Reynolds and Sedgwick were still west of the Rappahannock, south of the town.) Hooker sent his orders at 1:55a.m., expecting that Reynolds would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> marching before daylight, but problems with his telegraph communications delayed the order to Fredericksburg until just before sunrise. Reynolds was forced to make a risky daylight march. By the afternoon of May 2, when Hooker expected him to be digging in on the Union right at Chancellorsville, Reynolds was still marching to the Rappahannock.|$|E
25|$|A {{need for}} greater {{expertise}} within the project, along with difficult relations between Rover management and Frank Whittle (not least because Rover under AM approval had secretly designed a different engine layout, known within Rover as the B.26, which {{they thought was}} superior), led to Rover handing over their part in the jet engine project and the Barnoldswick factory to Rolls-Royce {{in exchange for the}} latter's Meteor tank engine factory at Ascot Road, Nottingham, the result of a handshake deal between Rover's Spencer Wilks and Rolls-Royce's Ernest Hives made in a local inn in Clitheroe. The official hand-over date was 1 April 1943, though there was a considerable overlap, and several key Rover staff such as Adrian Lombard and John Herriot, the latter being at Rover on secondment from the Air Inspection Department (AID) of the AM, moved to Rolls-Royce. In exchange for the jet engine project and its facilities, Rover was given the contract and production equipment to make Meteor tank engines, which continued until 1964. Although Rolls-Royce under Stanley Hooker were soon to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> producing the Whittle-designed W.2B/23 engine (known within Rover as the B.23, later named by Rolls-Royce the Welland), they evaluated the 4 Lombard/Herriot re-designed Rover W.2B/B.26 engines under test {{at the time of the}} takeover, and selected the Rover design for their own jet engine development (it became the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine).|$|E

500|$|Passage of the Stipulation Act of 1977 {{transferred}} {{responsibility for}} nuclear waste management {{from the government}} to the nuclear industry, requiring reactor operators to present an acceptable plan for waste management with [...] "absolute safety" [...] {{in order to obtain}} an operating license. In early 1980, after the Three Mile Island meltdown in the United States, a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in Sweden. In late 1980, after a three-question referendum produced mixed results, the Swedish Parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010. In 2010, the Swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors. The new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites, Oskarshamn, Ringhals or Forsmark, and only to replace one of the existing reactors, {{that will have to be}} shut down for the new one to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> up.|$|E
500|$|As {{the crowds}} outside the stadium {{continued}} to grow, local police stations were mobilised, {{but by the}} time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put it mildly, the whole thing was a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds. The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start,</b> but that when King George V arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing [...] "God Save The King", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.|$|E
