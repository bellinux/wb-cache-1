25|$|Innovative {{solutions}} {{have been}} conceived {{to deal with}} nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts. Nutrient remediation {{is a form of}} environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In environmental remediation nutrient removal technologies include <b>biofiltration,</b> which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, riparian areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development. <b>Biofiltration</b> utilizes biological assimilation to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, called biostimulation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biofiltration</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used {{for the treatment of}} different types of water. Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. <b>Biofiltration</b> is also common in wastewater treatment, aquaculture and greywater recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing water quality.|$|E

5000|$|Depending on {{the sophistication}} {{and cost of}} the {{aquaponics}} system, the units for solids removal, <b>biofiltration,</b> and/or the hydroponics subsystem may be combined into one unit or subsystem, which prevents the water from flowing directly from the aquaculture {{part of the system}} to the hydroponics part. By utilizing gravel or sand as plant supporting medium, solids are captured and the medium has enough surface area for fixed-film nitrification. [...] The ability to combine <b>biofiltration</b> and hydroponics allows for aquaponic system to in many cases eliminate the need for an expensive, separate biofilter.|$|E

50|$|Floating reedbeds are {{artificial}} {{or natural}} systems consisting of buoyancy and reeds. Plants including rice and wheat can be cultivated on floating reedbeds. The {{primary purpose of}} artificial floating reedbeds is to improve water quality through <b>biofiltration,</b> preventing algal blooms through denitrification and plant nutrient uptake, with a secondary benefit of habitat provision.|$|E
50|$|Storm water {{runoff from}} {{residential}} areas in Civita {{and parts of}} Serra Mesa are primarily directed to a unique bioswale system in Civita’s central park. The bioswale, which has {{the appearance of a}} natural streambed, will remove silt and pollution from the runoff through natural <b>biofiltration</b> and reestablish plant and animal habitats.|$|E
50|$|Riparian zones {{dissipate}} stream energy. The meandering {{curves of}} a river, combined with vegetation and root systems, slow {{the flow of}} water, which reduces soil erosion and flood damage. Sediment is trapped, reducing suspended solids to create less turbid water, replenish soils, and build stream banks. Pollutants are filtered from surface runoff, enhancing water quality via <b>biofiltration.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{biological}} filters have simple superficial structures, {{their internal}} hydrodynamics and the microorganisms' biology and ecology {{are complex and}} variable. These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process {{has the capacity to}} maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate <b>biofiltration</b> processes), etc.|$|E
50|$|Organic {{matter and}} other water {{components}} diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by biodegradation. <b>Biofiltration</b> processes are usually aerobic, {{which means that}} microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to better filter these trace {{pollutants}} out of effluent water leaving waste management plants, studies conducted by Westerhoff et. al and Schafer et. al [...] explore the water filtration systems that are best at removal of EDC's from effluent waters.

50|$|A {{biofilter}} is a bed {{of media}} on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called biofilm. <b>Biofiltration</b> is thus usually {{referred to as a}} fixed-film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast, etc.), macro-organisms (protozoa, worms, insect’s larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). The aspect of the biofilm is usually slimy and muddy.|$|E

For 30 years, Enermodal has marketed green building technologies including rainwater cisterns, onsite <b>biofiltration,</b> radiant cooling, building renewable energy systems, and variable refrigerant flow systems.|$|E
50|$|The organic {{fraction}} of the waste stream is increasingly viewed as a resource. The resulting products - renewable energy and compost - benefit the environment: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce dependency on foreign energy imports; increase the nutrient composition of our soils; {{reduce the amount of}} waste going to landfills; reduce the amount of wet, sloppy waste going to other methods of disposal; reduce the leachate associated with stormwater management at landfills; reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from uncontrolled landfill operations; improve erosion and stormwater control through <b>biofiltration</b> (Schwab, 2000).|$|E
50|$|The primary {{challenge}} of rain garden design centers on calculating {{the types of}} pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can handle during storm-water events. This challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust native plants and encouraging adequate <b>biofiltration,</b> but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce redox of incoming pollutant streams.|$|E
50|$|Recirculating {{aquaculture}} systems (RAS) {{are used}} in home aquaria and for fish production where water exchange is limited {{and the use of}} <b>biofiltration</b> is required to reduce ammonia toxicity. Other types of filtration and environmental control are often also necessary to maintain clean water and provide a suitable habitat for fish. The main benefit of RAS is the ability to reduce the need for fresh, clean water while still maintaining a healthy environment for fish. To be operated economically commercial RAS must have high fish stocking densities, and many researchers are currently conducting studies to determine if RAS is a viable form of intensive aquaculture.|$|E
50|$|Recirculating {{aquaculture}} systems often involve intensive, high-density {{culture of}} a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains {{a high level of}} water quality that promotes rapid fish growth. Steps include solids removal, <b>biofiltration,</b> oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth, {{while at the same}} time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems. IWM offers several techniques including stormwater harvest (to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding), infiltration (to restore the natural recharge of groundwater), <b>biofiltration</b> or bioretention (e.g., rain gardens) to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments (to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas).|$|E
50|$|All RAS {{relies on}} <b>biofiltration</b> to convert ammonia(NH4+ and NH3) {{excreted}} by the fish into nitrate. Ammonia {{is a waste}} product of fish metabolism and high concentrations (>.02 mg/L) are toxic to most finfish. Nitrifying bacteria are chemoautotrophs that convert ammonia into nitrite then nitrate. A biofilter provides a substrate for the bacterial community, which results in thick biofilm growing within the filter. Water is pumped through the filter, and ammonia is utilized by the bacteria for energy. Nitrate is less toxic than ammonia (>100 mg/L), and can be removed by a denitrifying biofilter or by water replacement. Stable environmental conditions and regular maintenance are required to ensure the biofilter is operating efficiently.|$|E
50|$|The soil gas (vapor) that is {{extracted}} by the SVE system generally requires treatment prior to discharge {{back into the}} environment. The aboveground treatment is primarily for a gas stream, although condensation of liquid must be managed (and in some cases may specifically be desired). A variety of treatment techniques are available for aboveground treatment and include thermal destruction (e.g., direct flame thermal oxidation, catalytic oxidizers), adsorption (e.g., granular activated carbon, zeolites, polymers), <b>biofiltration,</b> non-thermal plasma destruction, photolytic/photocatalytic destruction, membrane separation, gas absorption, and vapor condensation. The most commonly applied aboveground treatment technologies are thermal oxidation and granular activated carbon adsorption. The selection of a particular aboveground treatment technology depends on the contaminant, concentrations in the offgas, throughput, and economic considerations.|$|E
50|$|Aquaponic {{systems do}} not {{typically}} discharge or exchange water under normal operation, but instead recirculate and reuse water very effectively. The system {{relies on the}} relationship between the animals and the plants to maintain a stable aquatic environment that experience a minimum of fluctuation in ambient nutrient and oxygen levels. Plants are able to recover dissolved nutrients from the circulating water, meaning that less water is discharged and the water exchange rate can be minimized. Water is added only to replace water loss from absorption and transpiration by plants, evaporation into the air from surface water, overflow from the system from rainfall, and removal of biomass such as settled solid wastes from the system. As a result, aquaponics uses approximately 2% of the water that a conventionally irrigated farm requires for the same vegetable production. This allows for aquaponic production of both crops and fish in areas where water or fertile land is scarce. Aquaponic systems {{can also be used to}} replicate controlled wetland conditions. Constructed wetlands can be useful for <b>biofiltration</b> and treatment of typical household sewage. The nutrient-filled overflow water can be accumulated in catchment tanks, and reused to accelerate growth of crops planted in soil, or it may be pumped back into the aquaponic system to top up the water level.|$|E
50|$|Native {{and adapted}} plants are {{recommended}} for rain gardens {{because they are}} more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment. The plants — a selection of wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees — take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Root systems enhance infiltration, maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in <b>biofiltration.</b> Also, through the process of transpiration, rain garden plants return water vapor to the atmosphere. A more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements {{that can be used to}} capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property. The whole garden can become a rain garden, and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself.|$|E
50|$|In an {{international}} competition, the Rice Design Alliance invited designers {{to set the}} tone and revitalize the main entry and reflecting pool that formed a key axis for Hermann Park, “The Heart of the Park”, {{and to create a}} contemporary update to the park's earliest plans by George Kessler and a subsequent, more formal Hare & Hare plan in 1936.SWA Group, {{an international}} landscape and urban design firm working in conjunction with W.O. Neuhaus Architects and other consultants, was selected over 100 respondents. The most striking of the changes to the 18 acre project area was a narrower, more inviting 80 ft by 740 ft reflection pool. It establishes the formal central axis for the space and its slight narrower design afforded elegant pedestrian promenades as well as a double-row of mature Live Oak trees - one row that had been planted in the 1920s to honor veterans of WW I, and a second row that was added as part of the project.Noted in a winning entry for the 2005 National Award of Excellence from the American Society of Landscape Architects, the “Heart of the Park” reflecting pool utilized a <b>biofiltration</b> system of gravel beds and perforated pipes to trap organics so that they naturally decompose. Porous paving systems and decomposed granite also limit potential damage from increased water run-off from the site.|$|E
