5|$|After having {{held off}} {{for most of}} the race, the rain <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> once more during the final three hours. This caused {{numerous}} incidents, including the No. 93 Autorlando Porsche missing a Mulsanne chicane and plowing through a temporary tire barrier. The No. 7 Peugeot made an unscheduled garage stop and retired one lap after re-entering the race, claiming oil pressure problems.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Sattelberg on 25 November, the 26th Brigade {{continued}} {{to advance to the}} north. Further fighting ensued as they pushed on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December.

5|$|In 1978, Bonfire {{shifted to}} a wedding-cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged {{on top of}} lower stacks.

5|$|In the UK, {{the use of}} cyclodienes as seed {{dressings}} for autumn-sown cereals {{was banned}} in 1975 and the levels of the chemicals present in the bird population <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> The population has largely recovered to pre-decline levels, with an increase seen in many areas, for example northern Europe. In Sweden, the population also decreased drastically from the 1950s, but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. ship {{formation}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> apart, apparently further delaying Callaghan's {{order to}} commence firing as he first tried to ascertain and align his ships' positions.

5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> under {{the barrage of}} arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E

5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000. Attendances <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> {{towards the end of}} the 1960s; this trend continued through the 1970s, though the decade did give Tranmere its largest-ever crowd: 24,424 on 5 February 1972, for a fourth-round FA Cup match against Stoke City. With today's capacity of under 17,000, it is unlikely that this record attendance will ever be broken.|$|E

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} moved generally eastward from Oklahoma and produced heavy rains from Missouri to Ohio on February 8. By February 9, it had reached Kentucky. A new, secondary {{low pressure}} system formed over Georgia along the warm front {{associated with the}} primary low. As the secondary low matured along the U.S. East Coast, the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas in association with the new low. Mixed precipitation soon spread across the Mid-Atlantic States, and heavy snow <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> from New Jersey northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had emerged from the battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E
5|$|As dusk <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> on {{the drying}} track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from {{rear wheel hub}} failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E

5|$|At 18:18 night <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> The Luftwaffe sent bombers from KG 1, 2, 3, 27 and 53 to bomb targets at Sheffield, Leeds, Hull, Colchester, Canvey Island, Manningtree and Sealand. British records {{mentioned}} damage only at Sealand. Most {{bombs were}} scattered over rural districts. In one incident, a KG 27 He 111, shortly before midnight, attacked the flying and training school at Windrush, in Gloucestershire, where night flying was in progress. The bomber, piloted by Alfred Dreher, crashed into an Avro Anson piloted by Sergeant Bruce Hancock. Both aircraft crashed, killing all five men involved.|$|E
5|$|By 21:00, {{heavy rain}} was falling which helped {{disguise}} the withdrawal. The heavy bombardment commenced and the units <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> {{back to the}} river. Half of the engineers' boats were too far west to be used (43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation process. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing {{it to be a}} resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall.</b> Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E
