5|$|The Antarctic scallop is {{monitored}} {{in connection with}} the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) classification set up by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). As such, notification is required to be made by vessels that land the scallop as <b>by-catch</b> during their fishing activities.|$|E
5|$|<b>By-catch</b> is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. <b>By-catch</b> affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
5|$|Conservationists {{are working}} with governments and {{fisheries}} {{in order to prevent}} further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. On 20 June 2001, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was signed by seven major fishing nations. The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries <b>by-catch,</b> protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species. The developing field of island restoration, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes. Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed. At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird <b>by-catch.</b> A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 treaty the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru and the United Kingdom. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce <b>by-catch</b> and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered <b>by-catch</b> by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through <b>by-catch,</b> but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{documented}} {{large volumes of}} <b>by-catch</b> that are discarded. For example, researchers conducting a three-year study in the Clarence River found that an estimated 177 tons of <b>by-catch</b> (including 77 different species) were discarded each year.|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} {{high proportion of}} harvested seafood is still wasted due to spoilage, particularly in developing countries, or because they are <b>by-catches</b> or have little economic value, seemingly related to inherent problems linked to unattractive color, flavor, texture, small size, and high-fat content. Thus, many fish and seafood species are still underutilized. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} documents widespread trawling {{damage to}} cold-water coral reefs at 840 - 1300 m depth along the West Ireland continental shelf break and at 200 m off West Norway. These reefs are spectacular but poorly known. <b>By-catches</b> from commercial trawls for deep-water fish off West Ireland included large pieces (up to 1 m(2)) of coral {{that had been}} broken from reefs and a diverse array of coral-associated benthos. Five azooxanthellate scleractinarian corals were identified in these <b>by-catches,</b> viz. Desmophyllum cristagalli, Enallopsammia rostrata, Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Solenosmilia variabilis. Dating of carbonate skeletons using (14) C accelerator mass spectrometry showed that the trawled coral matrix was at least 4550 years old. Surveys by remotely operated vehicles in Norway showed extensive fishing damage to L. pertusa reefs. The urgent need for deep-water coral conservation measures is discussed in a Northeast Atlantic context...|$|R

Even with protective measures in place, cod is still being exploited through <b>by-catches</b> {{at a higher rate}} than recommended by scientists, haddock is being fished above the precautionary level and although the anglerfish is profitable, lack of scientific data means that the stock's ecological stability is unknown.|$|R
25|$|In a 2008 report, Greenpeace notes dolphin-safe labels {{may make}} {{consumers}} believe the relevant tuna is environmentally friendly.

40|$|The total net {{costs of}} the {{introduction}} of a landing obligation for the Dutch fishing fleet are estimated to amount to between 6 and 28 million euros, depending on {{the way in which the}} quotas are modified and the prices of the <b>by-catches</b> to be landed. In this regard, it is assumed that the catch composition and all fishing activities will be the same as in the baseline year (2011). This study therefore says nothing about how fishermen could modify their fishing activities in order to reduce the {{costs of the}} landing obligation, and what the effects of such a modification would be. In the event that the catch quotas remain the same as the current quotas plus discards (scenario 1), the costs of the landing obligation for the entire Dutch offshore fishing fleet would amount to between 6 and 14 million euros. By far the largest share of these costs would be borne by the cutter sector. The additional revenues from the landed <b>by-catches</b> are greatly dependent on the prices at which they can be sold, and do not compensate for the extra costs incurred in order to land the <b>by-catches.</b> The additional costs for full monitoring of all fishing trips by means of cameras would amount to approximately 6 million euros. The costs of observers on all trips would amount to approximately 18 million euros. The costs of enforcement may work out lower if less than 100 % of the ships and trips are checked...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{practice}} of trawling started (around the 15th century), there have been concerns over trawling's lack of selectivity. Trawls may be non-selective, sweeping up both marketable and undesirable fish and fish of both legal and illegal size. Any part of the catch which cannot be used is considered <b>by-catch,</b> some of which is killed accidentally by the trawling process. <b>By-catch</b> commonly includes valued species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks, and may also include sublegal or immature individuals of the targeted species.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{the total}} volume of fish and {{shellfish}} caught in the North Sea was approximately 3.5 million tonnes. Besides fish, {{it is estimated that}} one million tonnes of unmarketable <b>by-catch</b> is caught and discarded each year.|$|E
25|$|There is {{substantial}} incidental catches in fishing operations. Often, the Harbour Porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is killed by incidental <b>by-catch</b> (10, 11, 12). Gillnets pose {{a serious threat}} to the harbour porpoise as they are extremely susceptible to entanglement. A study by Caswell et al. in the western North Atlantic combined the mean annual rate of increase of the harbour porpoise with the uncertainty of incidental mortality and population size. It was found that the incidental mortality exceeds critical values and therefore <b>by-catch</b> is a significant threat to the harbour porpoise. Harbour porpoises become entangled in nets due to their inability to detect the nets before collision. In 2001, 80 harbour porpoises were killed in salmon gillnet fisheries in British Columbia, Canada.|$|E
40|$|Since 1993 a {{significant}} increase in the skate catches from the Spanish trawlers have been reported (Duran et al. 1996; Junquera et al. 1997).

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{monitoring of}} the western corn rootworm (WCR) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, 1868 (Chrysomelidae, Coleoptera) {{is the most important}} precondition for convenient measures of eradication or containment. This research project aimed to assess the monitoring methods, especially at low population densities as currently observed in Germany. For this purpose, large-scaled field trials were designed in Bavaria and Upper Austria. The studies focused on the catchability, costs and <b>by-catches</b> of the pheromone-trap PAL in comparison to other trap types. In another experiment, different allocations of PAL traps in the corn field were examined. Finally, traps and pheromones often remain unused {{at the end of a}} monitoring season. Therefore the catchability of stored PAL traps in the next monitoring period was investigated. PAL traps captured beetles constantly on a high level. In addition to its low costs and reduced <b>by-catches,</b> the trap type PAL is recommended for the monitoring of western corn rootworm in Germany. Changes in locations of PAL traps within the corn field did not result in a higher catchability. At present, traps are placed in the fifth to eighth corn row and the results confirm to maintain this practice. Comparing the catchability of stored PAL traps to the catchability of fresh traps, stored traps resulted in comparable catches than fresh ones. It is concluded that traps and pheromones, which were stored dark and deep-frozen, can be used in the next season...|$|R
