5|$|Some {{people believe}} that, for various reasons, large cities cannot <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> tornadoes. More than 100tornadoes have been {{reported}} to strike downtown areas of large cities. Many cities have been struck twice or more, and a fewincluding Lubbock, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; Topeka, Kansas; and London, Englandhave been struck by violent tornadoes (F4 or stronger).|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> another tornado.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Kenney {{became a}} student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, the Air Corps' {{advanced}} training school. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, and therefore a waste of time, but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army. Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was particularly interested in low-level attacks, as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> its own bomb fragments. His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.|$|E

5|$|Mold {{continued}} to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, {{it would have been}} a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.|$|E

25|$|The touted Washington plan {{ignored the}} fact that Communist troops had long since learned not to mass where they could <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> {{tactical}} air power. Current communist tactics saw them dispersed around the Royalist positions and concentrating their fire on a strongpoint, converging for assaults at the last moment. The proposed defense also ignored the lack of viable defensive positions on the Vientiane Plain, and the dwindling air power allotment to support Royalist operations in northern Laos.|$|E

Abnormal signals were mentioned for Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Bohai and Zhangjiakou regions. Wang made an effort to publicize the information to 60 people.

Allbritton also had major disagreements with editor Jim Bellows over editorial policy; Bellows left the Star for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. Unable to make the Star profitable, Allbritton explored other options, including a joint operating agreement with the Post.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with his bare hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
