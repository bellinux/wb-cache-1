The Wren operators initially had to write down these numbers before the next count that exceeded the threshold was displayed - which was [...] "a fruitful source of error", so a printer was soon introduced.|$|R

Here we consider dimensionless units as defined in the SI, e. g. angular units like radians or steradians and <b>counting</b> <b>units</b> like radioactive decays or molecules. We show that an incoherence may arise when different units of this type are replaced by a single dimensionless unit, the unit "one", and suggest how to properly include such units into the SI in order to remove the incoherence. In particular, we argue that the radian is the appropriate coherent unit for angles and that hertz is not a coherent unit in the SI. We also discuss how including angular and <b>counting</b> <b>units</b> affects the fundamental constants. Comment: 19 page...|$|R
