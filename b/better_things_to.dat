The royalist VVD leadership reprimanded him, after which Gruijters discontentedly left the party. Together with Hans van Mierlo, Erik Visser, Peter Baehr and others, he {{decided it was time}} for political innovation. In the political programme of the new party D'66, founded on 14 October 1966, the need for 'radical democratisation' is discussed, meaning 'the voter directly chooses his government' and 'standards of democratic expediency should determine the form of government—monarchy or republic.' However, the party explained that 'the reason to change the form of government is currently not present', although it did seek to end the king's rol in the cabinet formation.|$|E
500|$|Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a {{prominent}} Hegelian, at first criticized the aesthetic section, Either (Part I), {{then he had}} much <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say about Or, Part II. Julie Watkin said [...] "Kierkegaard replied to Heiberg in The Fatherland as Victor Eremita, blaming Heiberg for not reading the preface to Either/Or which would have given him {{the key to the}} work." [...] Kierkegaard later used his book Prefaces to publicly respond to Heiberg and Hegelianism. Kierkegaard and William Godwin were very similar in their criticism of critics. He also published a short article, Who is the Author of Either/Or?, a week after the publication of Either/Or itself.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Culver {{played a}} {{supporting}} role in a low budget sexploitation thriller film, Ginger. While the film was a commercial and critical failure, Variety noted his performance positively, saying [...] "Only Calvin Culver...shows any indication of <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come." [...] This in turn led to an offer to appear in Casey, a gay pornographic film in which Culver played the title role, a gay man who is visited by his fairy godmother Wanda (Culver playing a dual role in drag), and is granted a series of wishes which make him sexually irresistible to other men. Culver later took the character's name, Casey, {{and that of the}} popular Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan to create the pseudonym under which he would appear in all his other erotic roles.|$|E

They would not stick in that {{as they did in the}} basket. “Men always use a wheelbarrow,” he said to himself, “and why should not I?” ...|$|R
500|$|However, {{she became}} {{dissatisfied}} with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even {{at one point}} calling for [...] "a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians", at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. I told him that I was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E
500|$|Having {{given up}} {{his pursuit of}} Skarginska, Bax {{returned}} to England; in January 1911 he married the pianist Elsita Luisa Sobrino (b. 1885 or 1886), daughter of the teacher and pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luise, née Schmitz, a singer. Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London, and then moved to Ireland, taking a house in Rathgar, a well-to-do suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). [...] Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym [...] "Dermot O'Byrne"; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax's earlier poems [...] "like his early music, over-written, cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity." [...] Banfield had <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say of the later poems, where Bax [...] "focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love." [...] Some of Bax's writings as O'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not only do you probably have <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E

Writing in a blog post, the studio stated that [...] "it's not a process I'm happy to repeat because I have <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do than argue semantics all day with jumped up, tiny, hypocrite attorneys ... there are more important things in life such as looking out for my team and feeding families." ...|$|E

2500|$|The B-side [...] "Hyakki Yakō" [...] {{was written}} before [...] "Santa Maria," [...] Yonezu {{wanted to make}} a song with a lot of effort and punch, and wrote ironic and sarcastic lyrics. Yonezu later felt an uplifting, un-sarcastic song would be a <b>better</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> release, so created [...] "Santa Maria" [...] as a result. The title refers to Hyakki Yagyō, a Japanese {{folklore}} concept where demons parade in towns on summer nights. The lyrics talk about late night drinking, and says that we have become the demons in the parade today.|$|R

2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had <b>better</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say about it than the people who looked at my paintings {{had to say about}} my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E

60|$|Nor {{let it be}} {{supposed}} that artists who possess minor degrees of imaginative gift need be embarrassed by the doubtful sense of their own powers.
