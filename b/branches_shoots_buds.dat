40|$|The {{effects of}} {{thinning}} and nitrogen fertilization, singly and in combination, {{on the growth}} of 45 -year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees in northern Sweden, were studied from 1983 - 1988 inclusive. Sixteen trees were examined each year for crown development. The number of <b>branches,</b> <b>shoot</b> axes and <b>buds</b> produced, branch elongation on main axes, and dry weight production of <b>shoot</b> axes, needles, <b>buds,</b> cones, and dead material on live branches, were determined destructively on four trees per treatment. Both thinning and fertilization influenced the number of crown components produced annually. Branch elongation was increased by fertilization, and decreased by thinning. The weights of the components studied were increased more by fertilization than by thinning. Thinning promoted the distribution of growth to the lower crown, while fertilization promoted growth in the upper crown. Combined thinning and fertilization increased the weight of shoot axes, needles and buds more rapidly than did thinning or fertilization applied individually...|$|R

Stem discs from distal end were less efficient in <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> induction. A combination of two cytokinins (BAP and KIN) as a synergistic effect on <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> induction from each segment of stem axis. Stem discs in inverted position produced <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> from the lower surface, showing strong polarity within the explant. Further, storability and shoot development of sodium alginate encapsulated <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> of Curculigo orchioides were tested on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium fortified with coconut water (10 % v/v). The frequency of regeneration from encapsulated <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> was affected significantly by concentration of sodium alginate and the duration of exposure to calcium chloride. <b>Shoot</b> <b>buds</b> encapsulated with 2. 5 % sodium alginate dissolved in MS basal salts solution recorded significantly higher shoot development than other treatments.

The types of explant, culture media, types and concentrations of plant growth regulators, orientation of explant and section of explant were tested for their efficacy in inducing and proliferating <b>shoot</b> <b>buds.</b> The elongation of shoots and root induction was also studied. Young leaves gave {{the highest number}} of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> when they were cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0. 25 mg/l IBA and 1. 53 mg/l BA. The medium supplemented with 0. 25 mg/l thidiazuron (TDZ) alone provided the best result on multiple <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> induction both in percentage of explant forming shoots and number of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> per explant. The percentage of explant forming <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> and number of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> obtained from leaves were 90 % and 26. 50 <b>shoot</b> <b>buds,</b> while those from stems were 96. 25 % and 23. 00 <b>shoot</b> <b>buds,</b> respectively. One hundred percent friable callus was induced from stem explant in the same medium supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) after 2 months of culture. Culturing whole leaf in the position of dorsal contact with medium gave the best multiple <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> formation of 92 % and 23. 00 shoot buds/explant.

40|$|The {{effects of}} phyA and phyB {{mutations}} on <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana have been studied. The phyB mutant showed a significantly lower frequency of <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration {{than did the}} wild-type, indicating a role for phytochrome B in the regulation of in-vitro <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration.

50|$|Micropropagation {{begins with}} the {{selection}} of plant material to be propagated. The plant tissues are removed from an intact plant in a sterile condition. Clean stock materials that are free of viruses and fungi are important {{in the production of}} the healthiest plants. Once the plant material is chosen for culture, the collection of explant(s) begins and is dependent on the type of tissue to be used; including stem tips, anthers, petals, pollen and other plant tissues. The explant material is then surface sterilized, usually in multiple courses of bleach and alcohol washes, and finally rinsed in sterilized water. This small portion of plant tissue, sometimes only a single cell, is placed on a growth medium, typically containing sucrose as an energy source and one or more plant growth regulators (plant hormones). Usually the medium is thickened with agar to create a gel which supports the explant during growth. Some plants are easily grown on simple media, but others require more complicated media for successful growth; the plant tissue grows and differentiates into new tissues depending on the medium. For example, media containing cytokinin are used to create <b>branched</b> <b>shoots</b> from plant <b>buds.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{regeneration}} of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> from callus {{cells in}} vitro {{is an important}} technique in modern plant genetic manipulation. Whilst {{it is clear that}} genetic factors {{play a major role in}} determining the ability of callus cells to become organized into regenerating <b>shoot</b> <b>buds,</b> the precise nature of these factors remains unknown. Here we show that callus derived from mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which have reduced levels of endogenous bioactive gibberellins (GAs), or reduced responsivity to GAs, regenerates <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> more readily than does callus derived from wild-type controls. In addition, exogenous GA reduces, and exogenous paclobutrazol (a GA-bio-synthesis inhibitor) increases, the frequency of <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration from wild-type callus. These results show that GA levels play a role in regulating <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration from callus, and suggest that variation in endogenous GA levels or responsivity may account for a major component of the genetic variation in <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration frequency described in other species...|$|R

Three independent variables were evaluated for <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> response and <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> induction. The variables include the concentrations of nitrogen (N 2), sucrose and growth regulator thidiazuron (TDZ). The <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> response for cultured explant was optimized at 4. 34 g/l of total nitrogen, 2. 65 % of sucrose and 0. 67 mg/l of TDZ with 95 % response. The optimum medium conditions for <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> induction was found to be Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with 4. 02 g/l of total nitrogen, 2. 36 % of sucrose and 1. 0 mg/l of TDZ with 10 number of bud per explant. The <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> so formed were elongated in 0. 5 mg/l 2, 3, 5 -Triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and 0. 1 mg/l Gibberellic acid (GA 3).

40|$|The Arabidopsis MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING 4 (MAX 4) gene is {{required}} for the production of a long-range, graft-transmissible signal that inhibits <b>shoot</b> <b>branching.</b> <b>Buds</b> of max 4 mutant plants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of apically applied auxin, indicating that MAX 4 {{is required}} for auxin-mediated bud inhibition. The RAMOSUS 1 (RMS 1) and DECREASED APICAL DOMINANCE 1 (DAD 1) genes of pea and petunia, respectively, are orthologous to MAX 4 and function in a similar way. Here we show that, despite the similarities between these three genes, there are significant differences in the regulation of their expression. RMS 1 is known to be upregulated by auxin in the shoot, suggesting a straightforward link between the RMS 1 -dependent branch-inhibiting signal and auxin, whereas we find that MAX 4 is only upregulated by auxin in the root and hypocotyl, and this is not required for the inhibition of <b>shoot</b> <b>branching.</b> Furthermore, both RMS 1 and DAD 1 are subject to feedback regulation, {{for which there is no}} evidence for MAX 4. Instead, overexpression studies and reciprocal grafting experiments demonstrate that the most functionally significant point of interaction between auxin and MAX 4 is post-transcriptional and indeed post-synthesis of the MAX 4 -dependent graft-transmissible signal...|$|R

40|$|Hormonal {{regulation}} of de novo <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> formation in leaf explants of mangosteen {{has been studied}} from a de-velopmental perspective. This analysis indicates that at least three discrete, experimentally distinguishable devel-opmental states, namely, morphogenic competence, caulo-genic determination and organ differentiation, were ex-pressed during <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> morphogenesis. The state of morphogenic competence in leaf tissues was expressed max-imally between days 10 and 12 of leaf development.

On the other hand, the non-embryogenic tissueof <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> cultures which were initiated without cold treatment (control) failed to showthe expression of WOX 2. This clearly demonstrates the role of WOX 2 in the somaticembryogenesis pathway and might be directly related to the stress conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} micropropagation {{protocol for}} high frequency plant regeneration was developed using nodal explants derived in vitro seedlings of Bambusa arundinacea {{which is an}} important multipurpose and edible bamboo species and recalcitrant to tissue culture. The nodal explants excised from 20 -day-old seedlings were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium fortified with various concentrations of 6 -benzyl amino purine (BAP) and kinetin (KIN) (0. 5 – 5. 0 mg/l) alone and/or in combination with 0. 5 mg/l of different auxins [indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) ] for <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> induction. The combination of BAP (3. 0 mg/l) and IBA (0. 5 mg/l) {{was found to be}} the best for the highest percent of <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> initiation (87. 2 %), with 24. 2 shoots/explant. The highest frequency (95. 2 %) of <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> multiplication with maximum number of shoots (90. 5 shoots/culture) was noticed on medium containing 4 % coconut water with 4 % sucrose. The regenerated <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> were cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of auxins alone and/or in combination with AgNO 3 (0. 5 – 4. 0 mg/l) for in vitro rooting. Maximum percent of rooting (85 %) was noticed on MS medium augmented with 3. 0 mg/l IBA and 2. 0 mg/l AgNO 3 after 14 days of culture. Well rooted plantlets obtained were established in the field with 92 % survival rate. The present plant regeneration protocol could be used for large scale propagation and ex-situ conservation of this important bamboo species in the near future...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} and direct <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> differentiation and multiple shoot induction from seedling explants of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) has been achieved. The frequency of <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> regeneration {{was influenced by}} the type of explant, genotype and concentrations of cytokinin. Explants, viz. epitocotyl, hypocotyl, leaf, cotyledon and cotyledonary nodal segments from 7 -day-old seedlings were cultured on MS medium augmented with different concentrations of BAP/kinetin. Among the various concentrations tested, 2. 0 mg/l BAP or kinetin was found to be the best for maximum <b>shoot</b> <b>bud</b> differentiation. Percentage as well as the number of shoots per explant showing differentiation of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> was higher on MS media supplemented with BAP compared to kinetin. Elongation of multiple shoots was obtained on MS medium fortified with BAP in combination with NAA and GA 3. The optimal BAP concentration for shoot elongation was 1. 0 mg/l. The combination of 1. 0 mg/l BAP with 0. 1 mg/l NAA increased the number of multiple shoots as well as shoot elongation. Addition of GA 3 along with BAP and NAA combination dramatically enhanced both multiple shoot proliferation and shoot elongation in all the explants. The elongated shoots were successfully rooted on MS medium containing different auxins. Among them IBA at 0. 2 mg/l induced maximum frequency of rooting followed by NAA and IAA. Regenerated plants were successfully established in soil where 90 – 95 % of them developed into morphologically normal and fertile plants. This method can thus be advantageously applied in the production of transgenic pigenopea plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} the protein of rolB affects shoot formation and whether this potential relationship depends on the developmental stages of the plant and/or on the culture conditions. Thin cell layers (TCL) and leaf explants were excised from tobacco plants in the vegetative and flowering stages and cultured under various hormonal conditions. In TCLs of vegetative-stage plants, the expression of rolB enhanced the formation of the <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> under hormone-free conditions and with specific concentrations of auxin and/or cytokinin, Histological examination showed that the induction of the shoot meristemoids was particularly enhanced by rolB protein and that meristemoid growth was accelerated. In leaf explants from vegetative-stage plants, the expression of rolB increased the formation of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> in the presence of 1 mu M IAA plus 1 or 10 mu M cytokinin, With BA alone, at a 0, 1 mu M concentration, shoot formation occurred in the transgenic explants only, whereas with concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to in mu M, it was higher in these explants than in controls. RolB protein enhanced the formation of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> in TCLs from flowering plants under all hormonal conditions. In the presence of 1 mu M IAA and kinetin, the protein also increased the flowering response. In leaf explants from flowering plants, the expression of rolB increased the number of <b>shoot</b> <b>buds</b> in the presence of 1 mu M IAA with 10 mu M BA, In conclusion, rolB protein promotes shoot formation; it seems to have a positive interaction with cytokinin and an effect on the induction of the meristematic condition...|$|R
