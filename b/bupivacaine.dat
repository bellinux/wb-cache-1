25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, <b>bupivacaine,</b> ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and <b>bupivacaine,</b> levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, <b>bupivacaine,</b> and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
25|$|Porphyria, {{especially}} acute intermittent porphyria; lidocaine {{has been}} classified as porphyrogenic {{because of the}} hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. <b>Bupivacaine</b> is a safe alternative in this case.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic {{is characterized by}} hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, <b>bupivacaine</b> avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as <b>bupivacaine</b> are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
25|$|In Peru, {{the ancient}} Incas are {{believed}} to have used the leaves of the coca plant as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties. It was also used for slave payment and is thought {{to play a role in}} the subsequent destruction of Incas culture when Spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it. Cocaine was isolated in 1860 and first used as a local anesthetic in 1884. The search for a less toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and procaine in 1904. Since then, several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use, notably lidocaine in 1943, <b>bupivacaine</b> in 1957, and prilocaine in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Adrenaline {{is added}} to {{injectable}} forms {{of a number of}} local anesthetics, such as <b>bupivacaine</b> and lidocaine, as a vasoconstrictor to slow the absorption and, therefore, prolong the action of the anesthetic agent. Due to epinephrine's vasoconstricting abilities, the use of epinephrine in localized anesthetics also helps to diminish the total blood loss the patient sustains during minor surgical procedures. Some of the adverse effects of local anesthetic use, such as apprehension, tachycardia, and tremor, may be caused by adrenaline. Epinephrine/adrenaline is frequently combined with dental and spinal anesthetics and can cause panic attacks in susceptible patients {{at a time when they}} may be unable to move or speak due to twilight anesthesia. Currently the maximum recommended daily dosage for people in a dental setting requiring local anesthesia with a peripheral vasoconstrictor is 10µg/lb of total body weight.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{anesthetic}} {{drugs are}} considered safe [...]These include local anesthetics (lidocaine, <b>bupivacaine,</b> mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), [...] ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, etomidate, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
2500|$|Anesthesia {{in animals}} has many {{similarities}} to human anesthesia, but some differences as well. [...] Local anesthesia is primarily used for wound closure and removal of small tumors. Lidocaine, mepivacaine, and <b>bupivacaine</b> {{are the most}} commonly used local anesthetics used in veterinary medicine. Sedation without general anesthesia is used for more involved procedures. Sedatives commonly used include acepromazine, hydromorphine, midazolam, diazepam, xylazine, and medetomidine. α2 agonists like xylazine and medetomidine are especially useful because they can be reversed, xylazine by yohimbine and medetomidine by atipamezole. [...] Xylazine is approved for use in dogs, cats, horses, deer, and elk in the United States, while medetomidine is only approved for dogs.

50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> {{injection}} {{is therefore}} being investigated {{as a further}} possibility of treating strabismus. In some interventions <b>bupivacaine</b> has been used alone. In others, a botulinum toxin injection into an extraocular muscle {{is accompanied by a}} <b>bupivacaine</b> injection into the antagonist muscle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> {{crosses the}} {{placenta}} {{and is a}} pregnancy category C drug. However, it is approved for use at term in obstetrical anesthesia. <b>Bupivacaine</b> is excreted in breast milk. Risks of discontinuing breast feeding versus discontinuing <b>bupivacaine</b> should be discussed with the patient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> is {{available}} as a generic medication and is not very expensive. The wholesale cost of a vial of <b>bupivacaine</b> is about US$2.10.|$|E
50|$|Ropivacaine was {{developed}} after <b>bupivacaine</b> was noted {{to be associated}} with cardiac arrest, particularly in pregnant women. Ropivacaine was found to have less cardiotoxicity than <b>bupivacaine</b> in animal models.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{concerns}} about long acting agents, {{a mixture of}} lidocaine and marcaine is often used. A mixture of 1 part 2% lidocaine with 3 parts 0.5% <b>bupivacaine</b> (trade name:Marcaine) provides 0.5% lidocaine and 0.375% <b>bupivacaine.</b> This has the advantages of immediate anesthesia with lidocaine during injection to minimize injection pain while providing a longer duration of action with a lowered concentration of <b>bupivacaine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>bupivacaine,</b> {{levobupivacaine}} {{is associated}} with less vasodilation and has a longer duration of action. It is approximately 13 percent less potent (by molarity) than racemic <b>bupivacaine</b> and has a longer motor block onset time.|$|E
50|$|The length {{at which}} the muscle treated with <b>bupivacaine</b> regenerates is {{determined}} by the length at which it is held during regeneration. Injection of small dose of botulinum toxin in the antagonist muscle weakens it for a few weeks, preventing stretching of the bupivacaine-injected muscle, allowing it to regenerate shorter than otherwise, thereby providing about twice the alignment correction of <b>bupivacaine</b> alone. The effectiveness of a <b>bupivacaine</b> injection may be increased by combining it with the vasoconstrictor epinephrine, which lengthens exposure time.|$|E
50|$|The {{intensity}} of the block {{is determined by the}} concentration of local anaesthetic solution used. For example, 0.1% <b>bupivacaine</b> may provide adequate analgesia for a woman in labour, but would likely be insufficient for surgical anaesthesia. Conversely, 0.5% <b>bupivacaine</b> would provide a more intense block, likely sufficient for surgery.|$|E
50|$|With surgery, {{results are}} seen in a few days. After <b>bupivacaine</b> {{injection}} the muscle is inactivated by the drug’s anesthetic effect for a day, and weakened by myofiber destruction {{for a week or}} so, after which regeneration and hypertrophy over 2-3 weeks gradually achieves the corrected alignment. If <b>bupivacaine</b> injection is combined with a small dose of botulinum toxin in the antagonist muscle, eye deviation during regeneration is minimized. Strabismus surgery generally sacrifices one mechanical effect to gain another, and always causes scarring, both of which may make any subsequent procedures more difficult. <b>Bupivacaine</b> injection treatment, in contrast, directly increases muscle strength and reduces length. Strabismus surgery requires an operating room, anesthetist, and other personnel, whereas <b>bupivacaine</b> injection in cooperative adults is an office procedure taking only a few minutes. <b>Bupivacaine</b> injection is not effective in paralyzed or atrophic muscles, or where there are restrictions to movement elsewhere in the orbit (e.g., fibrotic muscles). Very small misalignments might be better treated surgically because of the risk of “overcorrection”, which tends to cause diplopia (double vision).|$|E
50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Bupivacaine</b> is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. The wholesale cost in the developing world of a vial is about US$2.10.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> {{has caused}} several deaths when the {{epidural}} anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with known hypersensitivity reactions to <b>bupivacaine</b> or amino-amide anesthetics. It is also contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia (Bier block) because of potential risk of tourniquet failure and systemic absorption of the drug and subsequent cardiac arrest. The 0.75% formulation is contraindicated in epidural anesthesia during labor because of the association with refractory cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{many of the}} caine-type anesthetics are {{synthesized}} {{using this}} reaction. Examples include lidocaine and <b>bupivacaine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Long {{used as an}} {{anesthetic}} in cataract surgery, <b>bupivacaine</b> {{was found}} to sometimes cause strabismus, presumably {{because it had been}} inadvertently injected into a muscle. Initially attributed to simple myotoxic damage, careful observation of the clinical time course showed more complex sequelae, including increased contractility and elevated stiffness. It was later clarified that <b>bupivacaine</b> injection induces modest hypertrophy, which could be harnessed to produce muscle shortening and alignment corrections. <b>Bupivacaine</b> injection is currently an office procedure performed under topical anesthesia in cooperative adults, and has been used as an alternative to strabismus surgery to treat moderate-sized, non-paralytic, non-restrictive strabismus since 2006. Stability of alignment correction has been documented for up to 5 years.|$|E

5000|$|Levobupivacaine (rINN) [...] {{is a local}} {{anaesthetic}} drug belonging to the amino amide group. It is the S-enantiomer of <b>bupivacaine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like lidocaine, <b>bupivacaine</b> is an amino-amide anesthetic; the {{aromatic}} {{head and}} the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics. As a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable {{and less likely to}} cause allergic reactions. Unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of <b>bupivacaine</b> (as well as mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine) is contained within a piperidine ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines.|$|E
50|$|Lipid {{emulsions}} {{are effective}} in treating experimental models of severe cardiotoxicity from intravenous overdose of local anaesthetic drugs such as <b>bupivacaine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|And {{last but}} not least, some degree of {{improving}} in therapeutic index of NSTX can be observed when is mixed with <b>bupivacaine</b> and/or epinephrine.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{anesthetic}} {{drugs are}} considered safe [...]These include local anesthetics (lidocaine, <b>bupivacaine,</b> mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, etomidate, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bupivacaine</b> {{injection}} {{is currently}} the only pharmacologic treatment clinically shown to strengthen and shorten extraocular muscles. Myogenic growth factors (IGF and FGF) have only been tested in animals.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to blocking the nerves which carry pain, local anaesthetic {{drugs in the}} epidural space will block other types of nerves as well, in a dose-dependent manner. Depending on the drug and dose used, the effects may last {{only a few minutes}} or up to several hours. Epidural analgesia typically involves using the opiates fentanyl or sufentanil, with <b>bupivacaine</b> or one of its congeners. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid with a potency 80 times that of morphine and side effects common to the opiate class. Sufentanil is another opiate, 5 to 10 times more potent than Fentanyl. <b>Bupivacaine</b> is markedly toxic if inadvertently given intravenously, causing excitation, nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, or seizures, followed by depression: drowsiness, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnea. <b>Bupivacaine</b> has caused several deaths by cardiac arrest when epidural anaesthetic has been accidentally inserted into a vein instead of the epidural space.|$|E
50|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, <b>bupivacaine,</b> ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45-90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90-180 minutes), and <b>bupivacaine,</b> levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4-18 hours).
