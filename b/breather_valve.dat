50|$|The driptorch {{consists}} of a canister for holding fuel with a handle attached to the side, a spout with a loop to prevent fire from entering the fuel canister, a <b>breather</b> <b>valve</b> to allow air into the canister while fuel is exiting through the spout, and a wick from which flaming fuel is dropped to the ground. The wick is ignited and allows the fire to be directed as needed. The spout and wick can be secured upside down inside the canister for storage or transport. Typically the fuel used {{is a mixture of}} gasoline and diesel with a ratio of 30% to 70% respectively, although, the amounts may need to be adjusted according to fuel and weather conditions. Sometimes heavier oils are used to increase adhesion of the liquid fuel to the vegetation, and increase burn time and heat.|$|E
50|$|A {{fixed roof}} tank {{is a type}} of storage tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A <b>breather</b> <b>valve</b> (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many fixed roof tanks, allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. Fixed roof tanks without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a fixed roof tank can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, float gauges, and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|E

Tier 4 Emission control versus {{conventional}} engine {{design is}} what every design engineer???s challenge {{to be dealt}} with. To design an engine to current market standards and requirements has become very intricate. In order to make such an explicit design which meets the standards, every component of the engine plays as a vital role. Every component design and development to current engineering standards pushes the envelope of manufacturability to new limits, which constraints {{the cost of the}} product across the ease of manufacturability of it. In consideration of the complexity to be attained, every component design contributes to the existence of a complete standardized engine, such as integrated valve cover. With the new tier 4 final regulations for engine manufactures, every new engine produced needs to meet those regulations. Caterpillar Inc regulated to produce tier 4 final compatible engines for the market. The new drive for development of new engines identified the objective of this project to design a new integrated <b>breather</b> <b>valve</b> cover for large power engines. Valve Cover, the noun by name explains it covers valves. In explanation to the definition of the valve cover, it covers the cylinder head mechanism;this is a high speed operating valve. Valve Cover not only covers the head mechanism and should also be persistent to pressure, stress and heat dissipated during the operation of the engine. Valve cover design initiates and explains the intricacy of a complete engine design. All the functional requirements of valve cover would be designed, analyzed and validated in this project, that drive the process of execution of the project to several phases of product development. Process identified for execution initiates with correct manufacturing technique, design intent and analysis. Caterpillar Inc. Engineering standards have been taken as a reference for defining all form fit functions. Pro engineering, Abaqus, Gambit and Fluent are the computer aided design tools used in this project for the execution of design intent. Identification of a proper manufacturing technique, processed execution of design requirements and analysis of concepts of design are validated across the requirements in this project with a justification of value added solutions are notified in the project. Conclusion on complete product design of integrated <b>breather</b> <b>valve</b> cover with optimal solution of all the available techniques in every aspect of design, development and real time production of valve cover have been discussed in this project,Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
50|$|FRAM is a {{brand of}} {{aftermarket}} automotive products known primarily for their oil filters. Other products sold under the FRAM brandname include air filters, fuel filters, PCV <b>valves,</b> <b>breather</b> element filters, and similar products, almost all of which use the trademarked orange color. The majority of FRAM filters are sold in the aftermarket, however the filters {{are available in the}} OE markets where they are purchased by major auto manufacturers.|$|R
