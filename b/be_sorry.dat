So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot.

500|$|In 1863–1864 {{during the}} American Civil War, Edward {{traveled}} through Europe, taking {{the opportunity to}} visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father {{later on in the}} war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests [...] Edward's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman (whom he at one point intended to marry) broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, [...] "I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not <b>be</b> <b>sorry</b> for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war." [...] Eventually, Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict. He may have suffered from mild depression during this period, and often complained of boredom.|$|E

[...] Repent means [...] "to be sorry," [...] but John's call was not to <b>be</b> <b>sorry,</b> but to change mental attitudes [...] and conduct. Robertson lamented the fact that in his time there was no English word that signified the meaning of the Greek μετάνοια (metanoia).|$|E

In May that year intelligence of a planned uprising for June in the manufacturing areas of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire was acquired by the authorities and its leaders were arrested.
