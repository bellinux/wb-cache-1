As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> Indiana University.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the rest}} of Europe was cooling, the area around Gibraltar back then resembled a European Serengeti.

Clive Finlayson, evolutionary <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> the Gibraltar Museum said [...] "this natural richness of wildlife and plants in the nearby sandy plains, woodlands, shrublands, wetlands, cliffs and coastline probably helped the Neanderthals to persist."

Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, but we believe in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is time to find out about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe." ...|$|E

In 1898–1899, together with Deodat Țăranu, he was also curator of the Medical and Naturalist Society, criticized by researcher N. A. Bogdan for their inconsistent, [...] "haphazard" [...] work at the numismatics collection. Nevertheless, in 1901 Bujor became the Society's secretary general, serving until 1905 or 1906. His research took him outside the country: with Voinov and Racoviță, he worked as a marine <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> Banyuls-sur-Mer and at the Stazione Zoologica of Naples, returning with a rich collection of biological samples, which he donated to his faculty. In 1903, with Alexandru Popovici and Leon Cosmovici, he held a pioneering extracurricular course on parasitology. He then followed up with other such courses, in embryology and histology. From 1904, his articles promoting physical culture among the peasantry were hosted by Cultura Română, the popular pedagogy magazine, with Bujor serving as president of the Iași Society for Gymnastics, Sport and Music. His efforts in that field led to the establishment of multi-sport venues in Copou Park, and the first ever chalet on Ceahlău Massif.|$|E

The [...] "suspiciously amateurish" [...] interview included, according to Dawkins, [...] "the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way" [...] (namely, to [...] "give {{an example of a}} genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome"). Realising that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his own admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question, but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: [...] "My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!" ...|$|E
