The population consisted of all students with visual problems (<b>blind</b> and partially <b>blind)</b> and normal students in secondary schools in Tehran in the academic year 2013 - 2014. Using a multi-stage random sampling method, 40 students were selected from each group. The SF- 36 s quality of life questionnaire and Foster and Inderbitzen social skills questionnaire were used as research tools. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The results showed that normal people had a better quality of life than those who are <b>blind.</b> There were no significant difference between the partially <b>blind</b> people’s quality of life and <b>blind</b> and normal people’s quality of life. The normal people had better social behavior than partially <b>blind</b> and <b>blind</b> people.

5|$|The low-key {{lighting}} schemes of many classic film noirs {{are associated with}} stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian <b>blinds</b> or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography {{is considered by many}} to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Niagara (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while Slightly Scarlet (1956), Party Girl (1958), and Vertigo (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.|$|E
