And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.|$|E

[...] Blackwell's campaign relied heavily on accusations that Ted Strickland was not a resident of Ohio, and later that Ted Strickland was gay. Both of these accusations played heavily in campaign literature that failed to resonate with Ohio voters. Due to his poor management of this campaign, Blackwell's ability to compete on a national stage was called into question.|$|E

2500|$|Some campaigners, {{such as the}} Tennessee-based Liberty Legal Foundation, {{contend that}} in order for a person to be a natural-born citizen within the meaning of Article II, Section 1, it is {{necessary}} that both parents be U.S. citizens at the time of that person's birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that since Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, Obama could not have been a natural-born citizen, and is therefore ineligible to <b>be</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The Liberty Legal Foundation has cited a passage in the decision on an 1875 voting rights case which came before the U.S. Supreme Court—Minor v.

2500|$|Roosevelt {{grew up in}} an {{atmosphere}} of privilege. His father, had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather. James was a prominent Bourbon Democrat; when he took along five-year-old Franklin to see President Grover Cleveland, the busy president told Franklin, [...] "I have one wish for you, little man, that you will never <b>be</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States." [...] Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin's early years; she once declared, [...] "My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all." [...] James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time. Frequent trips to Europe—he made his first excursion at the age of two and went with his parents every year from the ages of seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French.|$|E

[...] He also began airing his first television advertisement in key caucus-primary states. The ad concentrated solely on the transformation of New York City under the Giuliani mayoralty.
