5|$|The Italian {{sculptor}} Emilio Sala {{was responsible}} for both {{the internal and external}} sculptural decorations, such as mermaids, dolphins, and frogs {{on the roof of the}} building, sinking ships and hunting trophies on the exterior walls, and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and chandeliers depicting huge catfish strangled in the stems of lotus flowers. The exterior sculptures created by Sala were made out of cement. Production of the cement was by the «For» company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary <b>building</b> <b>material</b> by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a <b>building</b> <b>material,</b> so its use was employed as publicity for both the house and the <b>building</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11thcentury onwards it was the primary <b>building</b> <b>material</b> for Christian castles in Spain, {{while at the same}} time timber was still the dominant <b>building</b> <b>material</b> in north-west Europe.|$|E

Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable <b>building</b> <b>material</b> in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material.

5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as <b>building</b> <b>material,</b> a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E

In the order to simplify the procedure of arriving at a decision, priorities in selection were emphasized in every separate segment of this paper.

While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main <b>building</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important <b>building</b> <b>material</b> in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of <b>building</b> <b>material</b> for the region's churches.
