5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the Syndicate agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate members will <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> the colonists.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether bin Laden and his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
5|$|In a {{move against}} the insurgency, the Cylons decide {{to have the}} NCP arrest 200 civilians {{they believe to be}} {{affiliated}} with the resistance. Headed by Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna), a former Galactica deckhand and resistance fighter, most of the arrests take place during the night. Those being arrested include Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) and Cally Henderson Tyrol (Nicki Clyne). Learning of Cally's arrest, Jammer attempts to get her released by Boomer, but Boomer is unable to help. After another suicide bombing at a power station, the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed, but require President Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) signature. When he refuses to sign, an Aaron Doral (Matthew Bennett) copy forces him to at gunpoint. Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer) attempts to stop him, but Doral shoots her in the head. Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons know he is leading the resistance. He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen discovers where the resistance plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet.|$|E

25|$|They were {{concerned}} that whilst {{the scale of the}} project demanded a monumental building, it should not ape the triumphal classicism of many earlier public buildings. The wide open foyers, with bars and restaurants, were intended to <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> places for all: there were to be no separate bars for different classes of patron. Because these public spaces were built around the auditorium, they also had the effect of insulating the Hall from the noise of the adjacent railway bridge.|$|E
25|$|By 12:30p.m., Carr's second brigade, Vandever's, {{arrived at}} Elkhorn. The Federal {{division}} commander immediately launched this unit in a counterattack on Price's right flank. Superior numbers of Southerners eventually forced Vandever {{to pull back}} a short distance uphill. At 2:00p.m. Van Dorn found out that McCulloch's division would not <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> Price's at Elkhorn. At this time, Henry Little, on his own initiative, waved his 1st Missouri Brigade forward and the Rebel advance began to roll uphill. These events finally convinced Van Dorn to take more aggressive action. Price was wounded but remained in charge of his left wing while Van Dorn took tactical control of the Confederate right wing. But more time was lost in reorganizing Price's division to attack. Meanwhile, Curtis was rushing small units to Carr's assistance {{as quickly as he}} could. Carr himself was wounded three times: in the ankle, neck and arm, but refused to leave the field. In 1894 he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions this day.|$|E
25|$|The Army Council instead sanctioned {{a mortar}} attack on Downing Street, and in mid-1990 two IRA members {{travelled}} to London {{to plan the}} attack. One of the IRA members was knowledgeable about the trajectory of mortars and the other, from the IRA's Belfast Brigade, was familiar with their manufacture. An active service unit bought a Ford Transit van and rented a garage, and an IRA co-ordinator procured the explosives and materials {{needed to make the}} mortars. The IRA unit began making the mortars and cutting a hole in the roof of the van for the mortars to be fired through. They reconnoitred locations in Whitehall to find a suitable place from which the mortars could be fired at the back of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence and office. Once preparations were complete the two IRA members returned to Ireland, as the IRA leadership considered them valuable personnel and did not wish to risk them being arrested in any follow-up operation by the security services. In November 1990 Margaret Thatcher unexpectedly resigned from office, but the Army Council decided the planned attack should still go ahead, targeting her successor John Major. The IRA planned to attack when Major and his ministers were likely to <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> at Downing Street, and waited until the date of a planned cabinet meeting was publicly known.|$|E

As a result, he decides to resume dating {{with the help of the}} office employees, even going so far as threatening to fire them if they do not help. No one in the office wants to set up any of their friends with Michael, but when Michael learns that the chair model had died in a car crash some time ago, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) takes pity and sets him up on a blind date with her landlady (Brooke Dillman). The date does not go well, beginning with Michael pretending he is not who she was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>meeting.</b> After Michael admits his own blind date was a failure, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) convinces him that he needs closure on this person he loved who is gone.

500|$|As {{the high}} point of the royal progress, Catherine {{scheduled}} a meeting with her daughter Elisabeth, the third wife of Philip II of Spain. Catherine was so determined to make a magnificent impression on the Spanish court that she indulged in a spending spree that was extravagant even by her own standards. To help pay for the planned pageantry and entertainments, she borrowed 700,000 écus from the Gondi bank. Catherine had assumed she would also <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> King Philip himself, but early in the tour, he sent word {{that he would not be}} attending. He was outraged that Catherine, whom he called [...] "Madame La Serpente", had received an embassy from the Sultan of Turkey. He also objected to her Edict of Amboise (1563), which had offered concessions to the Huguenots. In short, French religious policy disgusted him. [...] In his place he sent [...] "the severe and ferocious" [...] Duke of Alba, with orders to convince Catherine that persecuting, imprisoning, and torturing Huguenots was the way to deal with heretics, not making treaties with them. In the event, Catherine left Alba befuddled by her darting mind. He found her far more interested in discussing marriage alliances and in showing him what the French court could lay on in the way of fabulous entertainments.|$|E
500|$|During Tankersley's {{tenure as}} {{publisher}} of the Times-Herald, the paper was embroiled in two controversies related to McCarthy, one involving attacks intended to help unseat Democratic Senator Millard E. Tydings in 1950, {{and the other a}} lawsuit brought by Drew Pearson in 1951 over what Pearson viewed as a [...] "conspiracy to smear his reputation". In the Tydings case, a composite photograph created by Garvin Tankersley made Tydings appear to <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> with a communist party leader and was a factor in Tydings losing his race. It also brought Bazy and her paper {{to the attention of the}} United States Senate, where the paper's treatment of Tydings was viewed by a bipartisan Senate panel as a violation of [...] "simple decency and honesty" [...] and [...] "a shocking abuse of the spirit and intent of the First Amendment of the Constitution". The lawsuit was a $5.1 million cause filed by Pearson against multiple defendants, including McCarthy and the Times-Herald, Westbrook Pegler and Fulton Lewis, alleging they had [...] "contrived... to hold plaintiff up to public scorn and ridicule". Pearson frequently criticized McCarthy, McCarthy criticized Pearson in a speech on the floor of the Senate, and the two men had even been in a physical altercation in December 1950. The Times-Herald ran articles critical of Pearson and in one case described Pearson as a [...] "New Deal communist", though it was asserted to have been a typographical error that should have read [...] "columnist".|$|E

According to Wong, Selena told him she would <b>be</b> <b>meeting</b> Saldívar {{the next morning to}} pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. The same day, she told another employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. At 7:30a.m. (CST) Friday, March 31, Selena rose from her bed, donned green workout sweats, and left for Saldívar's motel room. At the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico. Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital, where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed [...] "clear symptoms of depression." [...] Saldívar told medical staff she had bled [...] "a little". The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery. At 10:00a.m. (CST), Quintanilla, Jr. contacted Pérez to determine the whereabouts of Selena; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. Pérez called Selena on her cellular telephone and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him she had forgotten the session and she was [...] "taking care of one last [...] business" [...] and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and was the last time Pérez heard her voice.|$|E
