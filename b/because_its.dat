5|$|George placed B.telmatiaea in {{subgenus}} Banksia <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescence is {{a typical}} Banksia flower spike, section Oncostylis because it has hooked styles, and series Abietinae <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be B.leptophylla (Slender-leaved Banksia), which differs from B.telmatiaea in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed it between B.scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) and B.laricina (Rose-fruited Banksia).|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Gandhi {{wrote that}} he {{believed}} every Hindu boy and girl must learn Sanskrit <b>because</b> <b>its</b> historic and spiritual texts are in that language.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a possible dwarf planet for its size, {{but it is}} no longer considered such <b>because</b> <b>its</b> shape departs significantly from an ellipsoid.|$|E
5000|$|During the proto-Christian period (25 BC - 250 AD) Lapethos {{experienced}} a great commercial drive {{because of the}} plethora of its produce, but also <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> port and its shipyard. During this period Lapethos was given the name Lambousa, [...] "shining", maybe <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> shining wealth or <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> shining beauty and cleanliness or <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> lighthouse, which shed shining light to the surrounding region.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the Armstrong Farm {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places. It {{qualified}} for inclusion <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> place in local history, <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> connection to the leading Reber and Armstrong families, and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> unusually well-preserved historic architecture.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1977, the William Winter Stone House {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places, {{qualifying}} both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> architecture and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> place {{as the home of}} a leading local citizen, William Winter. [...] For much of its history, the house has been an informal landmark for locals, both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> architecture and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> significant commercial role in what was once a remote part of the county.|$|R
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.integrifolia is placed in Banksia subg. Banksia, <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; Banksia sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and Banksia ser. Salicinae <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, but this was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|Actinium metal {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300Â°C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals <b>because</b> <b>its</b> fluoride is most volatile.|$|E
5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subg. Banksia, and {{was divided into}} three sections, {{one of which was}} Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Spicigerae <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences are cylindrical.|$|E
60|$|To {{state the}} matter briefly: The hot water, which {{ought to keep}} on the surface <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> heat, is sunk by its superabundant salt; and the cold water, which ought to sink <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> cold, is buoyed on the surface <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> want of salt.|$|R
50|$|The depot {{was listed}} in the National Register of Historic Places <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> {{architecture}} and also <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> association {{with the development of}} Madison.|$|R
50|$|The {{grass is}} {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> attractive bunchgrass form. <b>Because</b> of <b>its</b> drought tolerance, {{it has been}} used on green roofs.|$|R
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>its</b> {{aforementioned}} holdings required affirmance, the Court did {{not reach}} the alternate ground for decision of the trial court that the appraisal and the payments were conditions precedent.|$|E
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative <b>because</b> <b>its</b> {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{suggests}} a southern, presumably Kentish, origin for the seax <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inscription only comprises the original twenty-eight {{letters of the}} Anglo-Saxon futhorc, and does not include any of the additional letters in use in Northumbrian runic inscriptions at that time.|$|E
50|$|The gum {{is known}} as Bengal Kino and is {{considered}} valuable by druggists <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> astringent qualities and by leather workers <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> tannin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> of <b>its</b> {{effects on}} drug and {{bilirubin}} breakdown and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> genetic inheritance, Gilbert's syndrome can be classed {{as a minor}} inborn error of metabolism.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, St. Paul's Church {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places, both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> {{contribution}} to local history and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> historic architecture.|$|R
5|$|Instead, Blanchard {{chose to}} play for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, in part <b>because</b> <b>its</b> coach, Jim Tatum, was his mother's cousin. Because NCAA rules at the time did not allow freshmen to play varsity, Blanchard played with the {{freshman}} team.|$|E
5|$|Mamilla is {{also the}} {{location}} of the projected Simon Wiesenthal Center's Center for Human Dignity, a controversial project <b>because</b> <b>its</b> construction would require building on part of an old Muslim cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Paints {{containing}} {{zinc oxide}} powder {{have long been}} utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect <b>because</b> <b>its</b> reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.|$|E
50|$|De Officiis {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most popular of Cicero's works <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> style, and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> depiction of Roman political life under the Republic.|$|R
50|$|It {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> {{architecture}} and also <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> association {{with the development of}} railroads in Middleton and Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|In early 1988, {{the bolt}} factory was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places, {{qualifying}} on three of the Register's four listing criteria: <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> architecture, <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> place in local history, and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> potential to be an industrial archaeological site. The only criterion under which it did not qualify was that of association with a prominent individual.|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{red list}} of {{threatened}} species includes one mayfly: Tasmanophlebi lacuscoerulei, the large blue lake mayfly, {{which is a}} native of Australia and is listed as endangered <b>because</b> <b>its</b> alpine habitat is vulnerable to climate change.|$|E
5|$|The MESSENGER {{space probe}} may provide {{evidence}} regarding vulcanoids. Its opportunities {{will be limited}} <b>because</b> <b>its</b> instruments need to be pointed away from the Sun at all times to avoid damage. The spacecraft has already taken a few of a planned series of images of the outer regions of the vulcanoid zone.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.canei is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; section Banksia because of its straight styles; and series Salicinae <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, where he found strong support for it and B.saxicola to be each other's closest relative. The two were a sister group (i.e. next closest relative) to the four then-recognised subspecies of B.integrifolia. The subseries all bear whorled leaves apart from B.canei and B.aquilonia. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. He did place the two subalpine taxa (B.canei and B.saxicola) {{at the end of the}} sequence as he thought they were the most recently evolved species, since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and B.dentata to be the oldest lineage.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Christ Church {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places. It {{qualified}} for inclusion both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> architecture and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> significance in the area's history.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, the Fitz Randolph-Rogers House {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places, {{qualifying}} both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> historically significant architecture and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> important place in local history.|$|R
50|$|At its centenary, the Insco was accorded {{national}} {{recognition by}} {{being placed on}} the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> architecture and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> place in local history.|$|R
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.marginata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. George did concede that major work is needed on Banksia marginata, which shows such a high degree of variability over its range.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae <b>because</b> <b>its</b> inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.dentata within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Neptune in 1846 {{led to the}} discrediting of the TitiusâBode law {{in the eyes of}} scientists, <b>because</b> <b>its</b> orbit was nowhere near the predicted position. To date, there is no scientific explanation for the law, and astronomers' consensus regards it as a coincidence.|$|E
50|$|However, {{despite these}} shortcomings, the Breda-SAFAT gun was {{generally}} praised by the Italian pilots and armourers, the pilots <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> long range and apparent good hitting power, the armourers <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> reliability.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{the center}} was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It {{qualified}} for historic designation both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> place in the area's history and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> historically significant architecture.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, the James Whallon House {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] It {{qualified}} for inclusion both <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> well-preserved historic Federal architecture and <b>because</b> of <b>its</b> connection to James Whallon.|$|R
