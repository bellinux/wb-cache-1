[...] As your knees bend, {{the upper part}} of the trunk remains {{normally}} erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair. In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick. [...] Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But there's {{no reason}} you shouldn't learn the manner. That's the way I succeeded. Fix {{your eye on}} one of the bottles; put your thumbs in your waist-coat pockets; stick out your elbows, <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> a little, and then go ahead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Flabboola! flabboola! [...] See the victims, see! [...] Flabboola! flabboola! [...] Victim, <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> <b>knee!</b> [...] Sinky panky! flabboola! [...] Fall {{upon the}} ground! [...] Sinky panky! flabboola! [...] Sing without a sound!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Step to {{the left}} with the left leg, <b>bend</b> both <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> and drop towards the floor on <b>your</b> right <b>knee,</b> {{performing}} a right handed gedan barai and the left fist on your chest.|$|R

50|$|Pop Shove It - This trick {{involves}} positioning {{your front}} {{foot on a}} slight angle, with your other foot placed on the back kick of the Penny board. Gather some momentum first, then <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> and scoop {{the tail of the}} board gently, using your back foot to pop it upwards. The board should spin 180° in the air before you try to catch it with your feet.|$|E
5000|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{awarded the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, and wrote [...] "Call us naive, but with beats this struttable, verses so irresistibly bop-friendly and that, ahem, killer chorus, who wouldn't want {{to take a chance on}} her?" [...] Daily Stars Sarah-Louise James gave the song a {{positive}} review writing, [...] "This has the same infectious kind of beat [...] "Happiness", which makes you want to <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> up and down in quick succession then bounce from side to side with a stupid expression on your face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{the first}} lady in Theos," [...] he answered, [...] "and {{you will not be}} content to <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> <b>knee</b> day by day before a plebeian. I will prove to you that I am sincere. If the King seeks your hand in marriage, I will not raise a little finger against him. But we will not support another Tyrnaus in another reign of folly. We will not {{recognize}} a king who places by his side upon the throne the daughter of tradespeople." ...|$|R
60|$|Couldn't you infuse {{a little}} romance into it? You might begin by going down on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'You'd be {{surprised}} to see how vain the girls about here be getting. Little rascals, why they won't curtsey to the loftiest lady in the land; no, not if you were to pay 'em to do it. Now, the men be different. Any man will touch his hat for a pint of beer. But then, of course, there's some difference between the two. Touching your hat is a good deal less to do than <b>bending</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees,</b> as Berta used to say, when she was blowed up for not doing it. She was always one of the independent sort--you never seed such a maid as she was! Now, Picotee was quite the other way.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The Push-Up: [...] "The push-up event {{measures}} the endurance of the chest, shoulder, and triceps muscles. On the command ‘get set,’ assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands {{where they are}} comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command ‘go,’ begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, {{return to the starting}} position by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. If you fail to perform the first ten push-ups correctly, the scorer will tell you to go to your knees and will explain to you what your mistakes are. You will then be sent to the end of the line to be retested. After the first 10 push-ups have been performed and counted, however, no restarts are allowed. The test will continue, and any incorrectly performed push-ups will not be counted. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees,</b> but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of your body weight with your legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or foot from the ground, your performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes in which to do as many push-ups as you can." ...|$|E
60|$|That depends {{entirely on}} how you do it. I may remind you, however, that first you go down on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Go, child,” {{says her}} mother, still very stern; “go and <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> proud <b>knees</b> and ask forgiveness; go, pray in {{solitude}} for humility and repentance. ’Tis not your reproaches {{that make me}} unhappy, ’tis your hard heart, my poor Beatrix; may God soften it, and teach you one day to feel for your mother!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, you do,' he insisted. 'You gave me {{an admirable}} lesson. First you go on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees,</b> {{and then you say}} you're quite unworthy of me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’ll tell you. I {{am going}} to make you promise on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees</b> that you will travel with me as you used to do, and obey all my commands.” ...|$|R
50|$|Bring {{your left}} foot to you right foot so they are {{together}} and touching. Here is where the step can vary. The easier step is done with a little jump to the left with both feet together so that you are facing slightly {{to the left and}} <b>bend</b> at <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> slightly. Jump back to the position before the jump and you repeat the jump. The dance then starts over.|$|R
6000|$|MISS SPAULDING: [...] "You are {{altogether}} in the wrong! And it's YOU {{that ought}} to apologize to HIM--on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees.</b> How COULD you offer him money after that? I wonder at you, Ethel!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You’re always a-being begged, and prayed, upon <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees</b> you are,’ {{said the}} footman with great {{emphasis}} to Trotty Veck, ‘to let our door-steps be. Why don’t you let ’em be? CAN’T you let ’em be?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear! Never see him, dear--never {{think of}} him again! Your father would not dream----Some day, Marjorie, you will rejoice--you will want to thank your father on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees</b> that he saved you from the {{clutches}} of this man...." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Ottilia {{was much}} braver. ‘There now!’ she cried in triumph. ‘What did I tell you? I told you I was {{fighting}} your battles. Now you see! Think shame of your suspicious temper! You should go down upon <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees</b> both to that gentleman and me.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] {{said her}} husband, doggedly. [...] "I {{know that your}} pore father never 'ad {{to put on a}} collar for me; and, mind you, I won't wear one after they're married, not if you all went on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees</b> and asked me to." ...|$|R

60|$|Number Eighty-one Norfolk Street, Strand--situated {{midway between}} the City and St. James's, and within five minutes' walk of the {{principal}} places of public amusement--is my address. I have rented this house many years, as the parish rate-books will testify; and I could wish my landlord was as alive to the fact as I am myself; but no, bless you, not a half a pound of paint to save his life, nor so much, my dear, as a tile upon the roof, though on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'Yes, yes; you must! Suppose you had {{got killed}} in that awful {{struggle}} with those reckless wretches tugging {{to get away from}} you! Think of the children! Why, you might have burst a blood-vessel! Will you promise, Edward? Promise this instant, on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees,</b> just as if you were in a court of justice!' Mrs. Roberts's excitement mounts, and she flings herself at her husband's feet, and pulls his face down to hers with the arm she has thrown about his neck. 'Will you promise?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{not only}} that," [...] added Tom, earnestly. [...] "That man {{organized}} a tug-of-war team,--the plumbers against the Local Conclave of the R. W. Q. Society,--and they've had three tug-of-war matches, and he has pulled the R. W. Q. Society over the line every time. Talk about pills that are worth their weight in gold! Why, Gumley's Red Pills for Red-Blooded People are worth their weight in diamonds, and {{you ought to get}} down on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees</b> and thank somebody for having been given the opportunity to advertise them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Test lateral flexion of the {{thoracic}} and lumbar spine: [...] "Stand {{up straight}} and then slide {{the palm of your}} right hand down your thigh towards <b>your</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>bending</b> <b>your</b> shoulder down to the side.""Now do the same with your left hand down your left leg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down on <b>your</b> <b>knees,</b> boy," [...] whispered Rudolph der Harras to Walter--"down on <b>your</b> <b>knees,</b> and beg his Excellency {{for your}} life." ...|$|R
60|$|Not that it's only {{myself that}} suffers from injustice, but that I am more alive {{to my own}} {{injuries}} than to any other man's. Being, as I have mentioned, in the Fine-Art line, and not the Philanthropic line, I openly admit it. As to company in injury, I have company enough. Who are you passing every day at your Competitive Excruciations? The fortunate candidates whose heads and livers you have turned upside down for life? Not you. You are really passing the Crammers and Coaches. If your principle is right, why don't you turn out to-morrow morning with the keys of your cities on velvet cushions, your musicians playing, and your flags flying, and read addresses to the Crammers and Coaches on <b>your</b> <b>bended</b> <b>knees,</b> beseeching them {{to come out and}} govern you? Then, again, as to your public business of all sorts, your Financial statements and your Budgets; the Public knows much, truly, about the real doers of all that! Your Nobles and Right Honourables are first-rate men? Yes, and so is a goose a first-rate bird. But I'll tell you this about the goose;--you'll find his natural flavour disappointing, without stuffing.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Then let {{the health}} go round, a-round, a-round, a-round, [...] Then let the health go round; [...] For though your {{stocking}} be of silk, [...] <b>Your</b> <b>knee</b> shall kiss the ground, a-ground, a-ground, a-ground, [...] <b>Your</b> <b>knee</b> shall kiss the ground.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads, give way! That's it! that's the way. <b>Bend</b> <b>your</b> backs, now! do <b>bend</b> <b>your</b> backs," [...] {{cried the}} captain, {{as the three}} boats sprang from the ship's side and made towards the nearest whale, with the white foam curling at their bow.|$|R
6000|$|Young Libertad! With {{the venerable}} Asia, the all-mother, Be {{considerate}} with her, now and ever, hot Libertad--for you are all; <b>Bend</b> <b>your</b> proud neck to the long-off mother, now sending messages over the [...] archipelagoes to you: <b>Bend</b> <b>your</b> proud neck for once, young Libertad.|$|R
50|$|And {{place them}} gently upon <b>your</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you don't}} shove your legs into them at all," [...] said Zeppa; [...] "you've only {{got to go}} on <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> into them--see, this part will fit <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> pretty well--then you strap them on, make them fast, and away you go. Let's try them." ...|$|R
