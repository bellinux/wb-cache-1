40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the influence of adhesive on bond strength of ABS edges and particle boards at increased temperatures. The issue also involves logistic operations, where furniture is exposed to extreme temperatures in {{both positive and negative}} directions while being transported or stored. The factor mentioned above is vital for choice of suitable adhesive showing the properties that have to withstand extreme conditions and comply with the required characteristics at the same time. The test was carried out using particular <b>board</b> <b>sheet</b> material that is commonly available and widely used in furniture industry. Bond strength was tested having applied EVA hot melt adhesive that was exposed to cyclic thermal load of 20 to 70 °C using the method of oblique shear and compressive load at 45 °.

50|$|Lower grade timber is {{converted}} to pulp to make newsprint. Higher grade timber is used in house construction. Radiata is used chipped to make particle <b>board</b> <b>sheets,</b> commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Most ply is structural and available in 7-22 mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7 mm) ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with resorcinol waterproof glue. Since the 1990s finger jointed joinery-grade wood has become available in up to 6 m lengths {{in a wide range}} of profiles.|$|R

[...] Her portraits were often personal: she drew herself, friends, passersby and famous individuals. She also created [...] "archetypal characters... part cultural icon, part personal symbolism."

40|$|A new {{substrate}} containing cellulose nanofibrils and {{inorganic pigment}} particles {{has been developed}} for printed electronics applications. The studied composite structure contains 80 % fillers and is mechanically stable and flexible. Before drying, the solids content can be as low as 20 % due to the high water binding capacity of the cellulose nanofibrils. We have studied several drying methods and their effects on the substrate properties. The aim is to achieve a tight, smooth surface keeping the drying efficiency simultaneously at a high level. The methods studied include: (1) drying on a hot metal surface; (2) air impingement drying; and (3) hot pressing. Somewhat surprisingly, drying rates measured for the pigment-cellulose nanofibril substrates were quite similar to those for the reference <b>board</b> <b>sheets.</b> Very high dewatering rates were observed for the hot pressing at high moisture contents. The drying method had significant effects on the final substrate properties, especially on short-range surface smoothness. The best smoothness was obtained {{with a combination of}} impingement and contact drying. The mechanical properties of the sheets were also affected by the drying method and associated temperature...|$|R
