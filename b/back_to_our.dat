In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, [...] "I do think {{from start to finish}} it's a much better record than Codes And Keys.

500|$|Risk, {{released}} in August 1999, {{was a critical}} and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: [...] "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after {{that we were going}} to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots. It took a little bit of time to do that." [...] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States.

500|$|A {{scene in}} which Craig's {{character}} rides a horse alongside a ravine and jumps down it onto a spacecraft emulated many scenes in American Western films where cowboys rode along a moving train and jumped on it. Favreau said the scene referenced {{the one in the}} 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones chases a truck and noted that a similar scene existed in the 1939 film Stagecoach, saying [...] "We're constantly referencing <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots." [...] Cowboys & Aliens also make multiple references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, such as the introduction to the aliens through the bright lights on their aircraft and an upturned paddle steamer {{in the middle of the}} desert. The film also [...] "tease" [...] monster movies, and the scenes in the paddle steamer were a deliberate homage to Alien.|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died {{of liver}} failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Three days later, during Megadeth's {{performance}} at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated [...] "Peace Sells" [...] to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover {{version of the}} Black Sabbath's [...] "Never Say Die" [...] for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: [...] "I told [...] after Risk {{that we had to}} go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots and play metal, and he quit." [...] In January 2000, guitarist Al Pitrelli, formerly of Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, became Friedman's replacement.|$|E

500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy?

[...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago".

500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> tiny room".|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we got to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E

500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
500|$|For recording, the Doors hired Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff {{and rhythm}} guitarist Marc Benno {{to round out}} their sound, with Scheff, in particular, {{contributing}} on every track except [...] "L'America". Densmore characterized Scheff as [...] "an in-the-pocket man" [...] and praised how he [...] "allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison, and he slowed Ray down, when his right hand on the keyboards got too darn fast". By all accounts, Morrison– a huge Presley fan– was excited by Scheff's participation. In addition, Benno was asked to participate {{as a result of}} his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell. The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional-quality 8-channel recorder, and the album was finished in six days. Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as [...] "blues day", recording [...] "Crawling King Snake", [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window", and [...] "L.A. Woman". The album had a raw, live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards. Botnick explained, [...] "The overall concept for the recording session was to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> early roots and try to get everything live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible". Mixing was completed at Poppy Studios between February and March 1971, by which time Morrison had moved to Paris, France.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention by}} film critics {{and seems to}} have been well-staged because a reviewer of The Moving Picture News states, [...] "This film points a moral and adorns a tale. Clean as a hound's tooth, sweet as a nut. Full of life. The tale of the triumph of a courageous girl, backed by an inimitable office boy, and the downfall of the grafter are well planned and well rendered. The copy room set our mind flying <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own 'cub' days. By the way, the paper {{on the wall of the}} traction company office is somewhat weird. A good, healthy, vigorous production in every sense." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer said the acting was good, but found fault with the plot itself. The reviewer states, [...] "This film story has melodramatic interest, and the acting is good, but the means by which some of the incidents are brought about will not stand the acid test. For instance, if a political boss wants to 'shake down' a traction company for $5,000, would he submit the proposition in writing? ... The scenes in the newspaper reporters' room would have been more convincing in the first scene if the staff had been more busy in writing copy instead of waving their arms and moving about." [...] The term [...] "traction company" [...] refers to a streetcar company.|$|E
