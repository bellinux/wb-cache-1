50|$|Brake fade is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the {{friction}} surfaces and the drum {{can act as a}} lubricant and reduce <b>braking</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point <b>braking</b> <b>efficiency</b> returns. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater pedal pressure doesn't change itâ€”in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it.

Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|E
