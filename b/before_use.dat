5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions <b>before</b> <b>use</b> reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E

5|$|The ferric {{chloride}} test {{is a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered <b>before</b> <b>use.</b> The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E
5|$|The red-hued {{heartwood}} is coarse-grained and soft. It {{is sometimes}} used for turning, but requires careful drying <b>before</b> <b>use</b> to avoid warping. A sample was prepared in Victoria in 1885 {{as part of}} a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. The collection was displayed in various exhibitions, including the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, and is housed at the Melbourne Museum.|$|E

5|$|The text {{asserts that}} fresh water is Amrita (nectar) of cuisine, and Visha (poison) otherwise. Someshvara III {{recommends}} fresh water from rains (autumn), springs (summer), {{rivers and lakes}} (winter) for daily use, {{after it has been}} filtered with a clean cloth. The text recommends boiling the water <b>before</b> <b>use</b> and using the water so in a day. For drinking, if boiling is not possible, the text recommends alternate purification method based on Triphala, and then adding a piece of mango, patala or champaka flower or powder of camphor for flavor and delight. The text mentions fresh coconut water and drinks called Panakas.|$|E
5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities <b>before</b> <b>use.</b> This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world <b>before</b> <b>use.</b> There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5000|$|An {{action is}} what a {{creature}} does during its [...] "turn" [...] during the action stage. There {{are two types of}} actions: quick and full. A creature can move <b>before</b> <b>using</b> a quick action, but they cannot move <b>before</b> <b>using</b> a full action. Spells can either cost a full action or a quick action in addition to their mana cost.|$|R

5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained <b>before</b> <b>use.</b> Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended <b>before</b> <b>use</b> in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the temperature was –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from –36 to –38 °C (–37 to –38 °F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours <b>before</b> <b>use.</b> The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.|$|E
