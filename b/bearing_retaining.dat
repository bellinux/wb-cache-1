40|$|The {{case for}} {{installing}} auxiliary bearings {{in parallel with}} magnetic bearings is often made with regard to touchdown, when a complete system failure occurs. The work reported in this paper focuses on the case when rotor/auxiliary bearing contact occurs, but the magnetic <b>bearings</b> <b>retain</b> their functionality. One may envisage future transportation applications in which this situation would occur, for example, during high acceleration levels induced by turbulence. An understanding of the rotor dynamic response during contact conditions could enable auxiliary bearing life expectancy to be extended using appropriate control action from the still functional magnetic bearings. To achieve this, a system model is required for control strategy design purposes. This paper considers {{the development of a}} non-linear system model for predicting the contact dynamics in a flexible rotor/magnetic/auxiliary bearing system. Previous experimental work produced similar contact dynamic response characteristics; whether due to unbalance or circular forcing through a magnetic bearing. Initial model-based predictions of these tests did not provide sufficiently accurate reproduction of the measured orbits, particularly in the presence of auxiliary bearing misalignment and multi-plane rotor contact. Parameter variations are thus undertaken to investigate the reasons for these differences. Contrary to expectations, uncertainty in the magnetic bearing characteristics during contact conditions appears to offer an explanation...|$|R
50|$|The final {{development}} of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, {{and was the first}} motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock absorber unit (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was designed by Veloce development engineer Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone <b>bearings</b> <b>retained.</b> Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional bronze bush and trunnion shaft pivot for the one-piece rear fork.

30|$|For {{a primary}} medial {{dislocation}} to occur {{there has to}} be both distraction of the joint surfaces and displacement of the bearing.

Distraction is likely to occur if there is damage to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) or if the flexion/extension gaps are not equal. The front of the meniscal bearing is about 5  mm higher than the deepest part of the bearing. So, a posterior dislocation is unlikely unless the bearing has spun resulting in a decrease in the entrapment.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic bearing systems {{incorporate}} auxiliary bearings {{to prevent}} physical interaction between rotor and stator laminations. Rotor/auxiliary bearing contacts may occur when a magnetic <b>bearing</b> still <b>retains</b> a full control capability. To actively return the rotor to a non-contacting state {{it is essential}} to determine the manner in which contact events affect the rotor vibration signals used for position control. An analytical procedure is used to assess the nature of rotor contact modes under idealized contacts. Non-linearities arising from contact and magnetic bearing forces are then included in simulation studies involving rigid and flexible rotors to predict rotor response and evaluate rotor synchronous vibration components. An experimental flexible rotor/magnetic bearing facility is also used to validate the predictions. It is shown that changes in synchronous vibration amplitude and phase induced by contact events causes existing controllers to be ineffective in attenuating rotor displacements. These findings are used in Part 2 of the paper as a foundation for the design of new controllers that are able to recover rotor position control under a range of contact cases...|$|R

However, arthrotomy through the old anteromedial incision is almost always required to remove the bearing and to determine and rectify the cause of its displacement.

However, in the cases above, the bearings could not be found through the anteromedial approach, as they had migrated well below the joint line. Although, a posterior approach can be used to retrieve the menisci, these two cases demonstrate that this is probably not essential. If the <b>retained</b> <b>bearing</b> did cause problems in the future, it could be removed with further surgery at that point.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{this article}} is to review recent {{publications}} regarding the results of posterior cruciate ligament retaining total knee arthroplasty, the most commonly implanted type of knee replacement used worldwide. Recent developments in understanding of the kinematics of these implants are discussed together with clinical follow-up studies. RECENT FINDINGS: The cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty is a successful implant design and can be safely used in patients with rheumatoid arthristis. Infection, aseptic loosening or wear of the insert continue to be the main modes of failure of cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty. All polyethylene and metal-backed tibias have similar outcome at 10 years. Presence of a ipsilateral planovalgus foot can increase the risk of failure of cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty. Mobile bearing knees tend to have low-grade wear whereas high-grade wear is more common in the fixed bearing designs. High-flex designs might improve tibiofemoral contact biomechanics if high flexion is achievable, although their clinical advantages are still unproven.

40|$|Purpose The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to assess the {{difference}} in active flexion between patients with a mobile versus a fixed <b>bearing,</b> cruciate <b>retaining,</b> and total knee arthroplasty. The study was designed as a randomised controlled multi-centre trial. Methods Participants were assigned to interventions by using block-stratified, random allocation. Outcome parameters were active flexion, passive flexion, and Knee Society Score (KSS). Outcome parameters were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively by an independent nurse. Results Ninety-two patients from one centre were inclu-ded, 46 in each group. Active flexion was comparable for the two groups, 99. 9 for the mobile bearing group and 101 for the fixed bearing group with a baseline controlled difference of 1. 0 (95 % CI- 3. 9 to 5. 8, n. s.). The Clinical KSS was comparable between the two bearing groups (Mobile 90. 0 vs. fixed 92. 4, n. s.). The functional KSS showed a difference that was attributable to the stair climbing subscore, which showed a difference in favour of the fixed bearing design between preoperative and 3 months (7. 3 point difference; 95 % CI 2. 3 – 12. 5; P = 0. 005) as well as 12 months (4. 8 point difference; 95 % CI 0. 1 – 9. 6; P = 0. 045).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Automotive transmission rattle is the noise generated due to impacts between manual transmissions meshing gear teeth {{in the presence of}} backlash. It {{is considered to be a}} Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomenon and is originated due to combustion irregularities (engine order vibrations), especially in diesel vehicles. This thesis focuses in the case of creep rattle for the MMT 6 Ford Getrag transmission (six speeds plus reverse) with a DW 10 b, 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke, 2. 0 litres diesel engine. This particular rattle condition is fundamentally similar to any other where an engaged gear is pertained (drive, over-run or float), with the 1 st or 2 nd gear engaged at a very low engine speed. The numerical models include an initial single degree of freedom (DoF) simulation. It comprises either of the engaged gear pair under Hertzian contact conditions or of a loose gear pair under hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Once the validity of this model is established and correlated with the results obtained from a single gear pair test rig, simulations of increasing complexity can be envisaged. A 7 DoF numerical model is, therefore, developed. The Hertzian contact model still prevails for the engaged gear pair, whereas an analytical hydrodynamic solution is implemented for the remaining 6 loose gear wheels and Petrov s law is applied to the needle <b>bearings</b> <b>retaining</b> the gear wheels. With the aim of accommodating a fully lubricated model of all the tribological conjunctions, an analytical elastohydrodynamic (EHL) Grubin type algorithm is employed. Also, the energy equation is analytically solved for hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic conjunctions, based on the assumptions dictated by the Peclet number. Therefore, under hydrodynamic conditions, the energy equation is governed by viscous heating and convective cooling, whereas in the EHL conjunctions the governing terms are viscous and compressive heating, together with conductive cooling. The <b>retaining</b> needle <b>bearings</b> follow the same heat generation mechanism as journal bearings. The effective viscosity, as obtained from the Houpert s equation accounting for pressure and thermal effects, is fundamental for the study of the friction in the contact. The hydrodynamic contacts are only governed by viscous friction, whereas EHL conjunctions exhibit asperity iv interactions as well as viscous effects. The results obtained from this new 7 DoF model are then compared to the experimental measurements taken from the vehicle tests and various purpose-built drivetrain rigs. A metric named Impulsion Ratio is hereby introduced, aiming to shed some light into the predictions obtained by the various models presented. This metric is the ratio of driving over resistive forces acting on each individual gear wheel. Its use is tested to predict single or double-sided rattle scenarios and, therefore, ascertaining higher and lower rattle levels. The 13 DoF model from which these conclusions were obtained includes shafts planar translation and rocking moments. The rolling element bearings supporting the shafts are, therefore, modelled to capture the inherent frequencies arising from their motion. The final model introduces the effects of transient thermo-elastohydrodynamics. This 7 DoF dynamic model accounts for a numerical solution of Reynolds equation with Elrod s cavitation algorithm for simultaneous teeth in mesh. The results obtained validate the previously used Grubin assumption by comparing the predicted central film thickness along the full mesh of one tooth. Also, the effect of starved input conditions and thermal and isothermal solutions are studied...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the functional and morphological changes experienced by bone and muscle during Ilizarov distraction osteogenesis. Although extensive {{research has been conducted}} in the area of regenerate bone formation, the effect of limb lengthening on the biomechanical properties of bone and muscle has not been thoroughly addressed. In this study, an Ilizarov external fixator was applied to one tibia of nine skeletally mature dogs, and distracted 3 cm over thirty days. The contralateral tibia served as control. Histology and weekly radiographs assessed muscle morphology and bone growth. The contractile capabilities of the gastrocnemius muscles from the experimental and control limbs were measured prior to sacrifice, and the bending stiffness of the tibias of five dogs was determined. All dogs experienced loss of knee extension secondary to muscle contracture and/or stiffness about the joint. These dogs did not bear weight on the experimental limb. In one dog, spontaneous resolution of the muscle contracture allowed partial weight bearing during the last three weeks of consolidation. Despite 3 cm distraction, tibial lengthening ranged from 1. 7 to 3 cm. Biomechanical testing revealed a significant reduction in the bending stiffness of the lengthened bones when compared with control values (p < 0. 003). The weight of the lengthened muscles was 35 % less than control values, a finding consistent with the histology which showed mild muscle fiber degeneration in all dogs. The contractile capabilities of the lengthened muscles were reduced to 29 - 80 % of control values (p < 0. 005). In contrast, the lengthened muscle from the weight <b>bearing</b> dog <b>retained</b> 85 % of the weight and 104 % of the maximum contractile force of the control muscle...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Previously, the {{clinical}} and radiological {{results of the}} self-aligning cruciate retaining total knee prosthesis at 5 -years follow-up were described. The 10 -year follow-up is now reported to determine {{the clinical}} and radiological results and {{the survival of the}} prosthesis. METHODS: A 10 -year follow-up was performed in this prospectively followed cohort of 246 (232 patients) self-aligning, cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasties performed between 1995 and 1998. Because patients had died and others suffered from comorbidities making them unable to attend a follow-up consultation, data could be obtained for 105 prostheses. Clinical results were evaluated by the Knee Society Score, and radiological follow-up was performed on standard AP and lateral X-rays. All radiographs were evaluated for the presence of radiolucencies, osteolysis and wear. RESULTS: At the 10 -year follow-up, there were no new cases of revision so that the cumulative survival rate at 10 years remains 95 %. The 10 -year follow-up shows good clinical results with an average Knee Society Score of 154 (SD 35. 7) and an average range of motion of 109 degrees (SD 13. 7). After excluding 25 prostheses for comorbidities, the mean 10 -year KSS score increased from 154 to 163 (SD 26. 2). On the other hand, for the ROM, the exclusion of the 25 prostheses had no influence on the mean ROM value of 109 degrees. At the 10 -year follow-up, none of the 100 available radiographs showed any radiolucencies > 2 mm on any component.

The fire reaction properties reported here showed the phenolic pultrusions to perform better than polyesters in all fire reaction properties (time to ignition, heat release, smoke and toxic product generation). The measurements under load in fire showed that the phenolic system decayed at a slower rate than the polyester, due mainly to the very shallow glass transition of the phenolic, but also the char forming characteristic of the phenolic. The behaviour described here for phenolic pultrusions is superior to that reported for some phenolic laminates, the main reason probably being their lower water content...|$|R
40|$|Mucin 1 (MUC 1) is a transmembrane mucin {{glycoprotein}} that is over-expressed and aberrantly glycosylated in > 80 % {{of human}} pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and {{is associated with}} poor prognosis. To understand the role of MUC 1 in PDA, we have recently developed two mouse models of spontaneous PDA, one that expresses full-length human MUC 1 transgene (KCM mice) {{and one that is}} null for MUC 1 (KCKO mice). We have previously reported that KCM mice express high levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in their tumors and develop highly aggressive PDA. To further understand the underlying mechanism for high MDSC levels in KCM tumors, we generated primary cell lines from KCM and KCKO tumors. In this study, we report that MDSCs derived using KCM cells express significantly higher levels of arginase 1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (markers associated with immune suppression) and lower levels of CD 115 (a marker associated with maturation of myeloid cells) as compared to KCKO-derived MDSCs. Functionally, KCM-derived MDSCs secrete significantly higher levels of urea and nitric oxide when co-cultured with normal splenic cells as compared to KCKO-derived MDSCs. Data indicates that KCM-derived MDSCs remain immature and are more suppressive as compared to KCKO-derived MDSCs. This was further corroborated in vivo where MDSCs isolated from KCM-tumor <b>bearing</b> mice <b>retained</b> their immature state and were highly suppressive as compared to MDSCs derived from KCKO-tumor bearing mice. Finally, we show that KCM cells secrete significantly higher levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2,), a COX- 2 metabolite and a known driver of suppressive MDSCs as compared to KCKO cells. Thus, inhibiting PGE 2 with a specific COX- 2 inhibitor reverses the immunosuppressive and immature phenotype of KCM-derived MDSCs. This is the first report that clearly suggests a functional role of pancreatic tumor-associated MUC 1 in the development of functional MDSCs...|$|R
