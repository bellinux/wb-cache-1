Human β-glucuronidase is located in the lysosome.

The authors used a heat shock promoter to induce the production of FLP while a FRT-flanked vector separated the CaMV 35S promoter from the <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> gene (GUS). When the plants were exposed to heat-shock, FLP-induction led to the excision of the FRT-flanked vector, effectively moving the GUS gene directly downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter.

40|$|We have {{selected}} the rat preputial gland <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> {{as a model}} protein to study the sorting of newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases to the lysosome. The complete coding sequence of <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> messenger RNA was determined from the sequences {{of a group of}} overlapping cDNA clones isolated from preputial gland cDNA libraries. The <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> mRNA primary translation product contains 648 amino acids, including an amino-terminal signal sequence of 22 residues. The polypeptide has four potential sites for the addition of asparagine-linked core oligosaccharides. A 376 -residue segment of <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> shows extensive homology (23 % sequence identity) to a portion of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. This homology most likely reflects an evolutionary relationship between the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes and the conservation of structural features necessary for the glycosidase activity of both proteins. Translation of mRNA synthesized in vitro by transcription of a cDNA containing the entire <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> coding region yielded a polypeptide that was immunoprecipitated with anti-beta-glucuronidase antiserum and had the same electrophoretic mobility as the primary translation product of natural <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> mRNA. In the presence of microsomal membranes, the in vitro-synthesized <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> underwent cotranslational incorporation into the microsomes, as indicated by removal of the signal sequence and the addition of several oligosaccharide chains.

40|$|Vectors were {{constructed}} for {{the isolation of}} random transcriptional and translational <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> gene fusions in plants. This system {{is based on the}} random integration of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) into the plant nuclear genome. The Escherichia coli <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> coding sequence without promoter, and also devoid of its ATG initiation site in the translational gene fusion vector, was inserted in the T-DNA with its 5 ' end at a distance of 4 base pairs from the right T-DNA border sequence. Transgenic plants can be selected by using a chimeric (P 35 S-nptII- 3 ' ocs) kanamycin-resistance gene present in the same T-DNA. Subsequent screening of these for <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> expression allows the identification of clones harboring a fusion of the <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> coding sequence with plant 5 ' regulatory sequences. After transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana C 24 root explants, <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> expression was detected in 54 % and 1. 6 % of the plants transformed with the transcriptional and translational fusion vectors, respectively. Several different patterns of tissue-specific <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> expression were identified. The plant upstream sequence of a <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> fusion that is specifically expressed in the phloem of all organs was cloned and sequenced. After introduction in A. thaliana C 24 and Nicotiana tabacum SR 1, this sequence mediates the same highly phloem-specific <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> expression pattern as in the original transgenic plant from which it was isolated.

40|$|The {{differentiation}} of renal from bladder bacteriuria is difficult on clinical grounds alone.

Urinary <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> activity was also determined in 46 control subjects. In general, asymptomatic patients with renal bacteriuria, either unilateral or bilateral, had levels of enzyme activity in their urine comparable to patients with infection confined to the bladder and to normals. Only 4 of 25 patients with renal bacteriuria had significant elevations of urinary <b>beta-glucuronidase.</b> After localization of infection, 9 of 10 patients treated with kanamycin, a potentially nephrotoxic drug, developed significant elevations of urinary <b>beta-glucuronidase.</b> The results of these studies indicate that determination of <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> activity in urine is not useful in predicting the site of infection in patients with bacteriuria but may find a role in screening for early nephrotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} four laboratory tests in detecting leptomeningeal metastases in 57 patients with breast carcinoma was assessed. The {{sensitivity and specificity}} of <b>beta-glucuronidase,</b> beta 2 -microglobulin, carcinoembryonic antigen and lactate dehydrogenase in cerebrospinal fluid were determined. As a single test <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> was the most sensitive (93 %) and specific (93 %) for discriminating between leptomeningeal metastases and other CNS metastases from breast cancer. Lactate dehydrogenase was the next most useful marker. Both beta 2 -microglobulin and carcinoembryonic antigen had a sensitivity of 60 %.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{of the relatively}} large amounts of <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> in microsomal fractions of normal mice depends on formation of complexes with the protein egasyn. Unexpectedly, {{it was found that}} the egasyn gene also affects the processing of <b>beta-glucuronidase,</b> which is segregated to lysosomes. In egasyn-positive mice lysosomal <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> from liver has a mean pI of 5. 9 with a minor proportion at pI 5. 4, whereas in egasyn-negative mice the proportion of the two lysosomal forms is reversed. Combined experiments measuring susceptibility to neuraminidase and to endoglycosidase H and specific binding to Ricinus communis lectin-agarose columns showed that the alterations in isoelectric point were associated with a decrease in complex oligosaccharides of lysosomal <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> in egasyn-positive mice. Since this alteration occurs not only in a congenic strain carrying the Eg 0 gene but also in several other inbred strains that are homozygous for this gene, it is considered to be a genuine effect of the Eg gene rather than other genes that might regulate oligosaccharide processing. Also, the alteration is likely to be a result of direct physical interaction of the egasyn protein and lysosomal <b>beta-glucuronidase,</b> since a second lysosomal enzyme, beta-galactosidase, which does not form complexes with egasyn, is unaffected. The results suggest a model in which egasyn not only causes {{accumulation of}} <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> in the microsomal compartment but also acts upon the precursor to lysosomal <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> to alter its interaction with trans-Golgi-apparatus processing enzymes...|$|E

The <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> secreted by 3 T 3 cells was purified 15000 -fold by chromatography on an affinity column made from this antibody and resolved into a single component, of Mr 68000, by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Iodinated samples of purified enzyme were taken up into mouse peritoneal macrophages by receptor-mediated endocytosis at a rate similar to that calculated previously for unlabelled enzyme, and uptake was competitively inhibited by yeast mannan. Binding of <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> to macrophages was saturable, with a Kd of 7 X 10 (- 9) l/mol, an affinity comparable with that calculated for the binding of mannosylated bovine serum albumin (Kd 1. 3 X 10 (- 9) l/mol), a ligand specific for mannose receptors.

Affected mice, of genotype gusmps/gusmps, present clinical manifestations {{similar to those of}} humans with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly syndrome) and are shown here to have secondary elevations of other lysosomal enzymes. The mucopolysaccharidosis VII phenotype in both species includes dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and premature death. Lysosome storage is visualized within enlarge vesicles and correlates biochemically with accumulation of undegraded and partially degraded glycosaminoglycans. In this report we describe the consequences of introducing the human <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> gene, GUSB, into gusmps/gusmps mice that produce virtually no murine <b>beta-glucuronidase.</b> Transgenic mice homozygous for the mucopolysaccharidosis VII mutation expressed high levels of human <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> activity in all tissues examined and were phenotypically normal. Biochemically, both the intralysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans and the secondary elevation of other acid hydrolases were corrected. These findings demonstrate that the GUSB transgene is expressed in gusmps/gusmps mice and that human <b>beta-glucuronidase</b> corrects the murine mucopolysaccharidosis storage disease...|$|E
