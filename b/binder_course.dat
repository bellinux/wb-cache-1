However, according to Latvian Road Specifications, this dolomite cannot be used for average and high intensity roads because of its low quality (mainly, LA index). Therefore, mostly imported magmatic rocks (granite, diabase, gabbro, basalt) or imported dolomite are used which makes asphalt expensive. However, practical experience shows that even with these high quality materials roads exhibit rutting, fatigue and thermal cracks.

The research was directed toward development of a chunk rubber asphalt concrete mix design for low volume road construction using local aggregate, shredded tire rubber chunks and a cationic emulsion. A set of mixes using different combinations of chunk rubber content, emulsion content and fly ash content were tested. Marshall stability results of mixes with 10 % Type C fly ash showed optimum emulsion contents of 6. 8, 7. 3 and 7. 8 % for 2, 4 and 6 % rubber, respectively. The Marshall stability values decreased for increasing rubber contents. The target Marshall stability value of a suitable cold mix at 43 ºC was required to be 2225 N. A mix with 10 % Type C fly ash, 2 % rubber and 7 % emulsion showed an average Marshall stability value of 1600 N. Based on the Marshall stability results, some of these mixes appeared to be suitable as <b>binder</b> <b>courses</b> or stabilized drainable bases for low volume roads. If 9 kg of chunk rubber equivalent is produced per tire, then a one km long and 7. 3 m wide low-volume road with a 100 mm thick base built with this mix can incorporate approximately 3350 tires.

40|$|Conventional hot asphalt {{mixtures}} {{have an impact}} on global warming and CO 2 emissions contributing to debates on environmental issues which have been raised in recent years. As an alternative, cold emulsion {{asphalt mixtures}} (CBEMs) provide considerable benefits such as eco-friendliness, energy efficiency and cost effectiveness connected with safety. However, their weak early strength along with the need for longer curing times (usually 2 - 24 months) and higher moisture susceptibility compared to hot asphalt mixtures, have been cited as obstacles to their wider application. That said, the incorporation of waste materials in CBEM mixtures enhances sustainability by decreasing the amount of industrial waste materials needed and conserving natural resources. A new binary blended cement filler (BBCF) material generated from high calcium fly ash (HCFA) and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FC 3 R) was found to be very effective in providing microstructural integrity with a novel fast-curing cold asphalt concrete for the <b>binder</b> <b>course</b> (CACB) mixture. Laboratory performance tests included the stiffness modulus test by indirect tension to cylindrical samples, wheel-tracking tests and water sensitivity. Regarding environmental issues, a toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test was performed to analyse the leachate from various specimens comprising concentrations of heavy metal. The findings of these tests have demonstrated that CACB performs extremely well compared to traditional hot mixtures. The stiffness modulus of the BBCF treated mixture – 3730 MPa after 3 days – is higher than the traditional hot mixture (100 / 150 pen). In addition, the BBCF treated mixture offered a superior performance regarding rutting resistance, fatigue resistance and water susceptibility as well as revealing a considerably lower thermal sensitivity. More significantly, the BBCF treated mixture was found comparable to the traditional asphalt concrete <b>binder</b> <b>course</b> after a very short curing time (1 day). Finally, the concentration of heavy metals in the specimens incorporating the BBCF was observed to be less than the regulatory levels determined for hazardous materials and so requirements were satisfied.

Both of these mixtures were utilized {{as part of a}} complete overlay project on the Veterans Memorial Expressway (I- 355) near Chicago as part of the Illinois Tollway system.

40|$|Roads {{form the}} {{lifeline}} of any country. It {{is considered to}} be an engineered structure and the pavement is expected to serve its designed life and meet the performance criteria for better economy. Various materials constitute the different layers of the pavement and their characterization becomes important for durability. In spite of these considerations however, many factors contribute to early pavement failure and improper material characterization is just one of them. The Bituminous mix which is used for the surface and <b>binder</b> <b>courses</b> is formed as a conglomeration of the binder, graded aggregates and voids which forms a stable mixture which can resist wear and tear as well as heavy wheel loads when used in the field. The bituminous mix needs to meet the volumetric requirements to attain stability. When bitumen is mixed with aggregates in a heated condition, the binder forms a coating around the aggregate particle which is termed as Asphalt film thickness (AFT) which is not measured but calculated. Bitumen due to its visco-elastic nature should be used at the optimum and the specified temperature to provide a minimum uniform film thickness to ensure proper bonding in the Bitumen mastic. Fillers {{play a major role in}} determining the properties and the behaviour of the mixture, especially the binding and aggregate interlocking effects. The filler has the ability to increase the resistance of particle to move within the mix matrix and/or works as an active material when it interacts with the asphalt cement to change the properties of the mastic. Mineral fillers serve a dual purpose when added to asphalt mixes, the portion of the mineral filler that is finer than the thickness of the asphalt film blends with asphalt cement binder to form a mortar or mastic that contributes to improved stiffening of the mix. In the present study the film thickness was determined by Hveem method by determining the total surface area and the effect of fillers thereon is discussed. The effect of types of fillers in varying percentage, in the performance of hot-mix-asphalt is also studied. Three types of fillers namely, Hydrated lime, Ordinary Portland Cement, and Fly ash were used as fillers in the present study. Their percentage by weight of aggregates was varied as 2 %, 4 % and 6 % to study their effect on the mix prepared for BC Grade II. The optimum binder content was determined for the various fillers and moisture susceptibility of bituminous mixtures was evaluated [...] The results of film thickness determination reveals that an average film thickness of 6 μm is obtained for all fillers which is necessary for durability of the mixes. The Fatigue results show that Lime at 4 % can be used for enhanced performance and 2 % is recommended, when cement or fly ash is used as filler material...|$|R
