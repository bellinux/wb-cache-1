5000|$|<b>B-scope</b> (Search)-Target azimuth and range, range strobe, range markers, beacon and IFF {{responses}} ...|$|E
5000|$|An E-scope is {{essentially}} a <b>B-scope</b> displaying range vs. elevation, rather than range vs. azimuth. They are identical in operation to the <b>B-scope,</b> the name simply indicating [...] "elevation". E-scopes are typically used with height finding radars, which are similar to airborne radars but turned to scan vertically instead of horizontally, they are also {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "nodding radars" [...] due to their antenna's motion. The display tube was generally rotated 90 degrees to put the elevation axis vertical in order to provide a more obvious correlation between the display and the [...] "real world". These displays are also referred to as a Range-Height Indicator, or RHI, but were also commonly referred to (confusingly) as a <b>B-scope</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|The antenna was {{necessarily}} small, a 12 x 16 inch cm {{parabolic dish}} that was stabilized {{to account for}} maneuvering. This was connected to a small 5 inch cm <b>B-Scope</b> display in the cockpit.|$|E
5000|$|Early systems {{included}} the US AN/MPQ-4, which used lobe switching to switch between two angles about 35 mils apart (about 2 degrees). Reflected signals were displayed on two <b>B-scopes.</b> Measurements from the <b>B-scopes</b> were copied into a ballistic calculator, which produced the X and Y {{location of the}} launcher. The UK Green Archer radar used a manual switch to flip between the vertical angles. The radar was normally left in the [...] "lower" [...] angle setting, while the operator waited for returns. When one was seen the switch {{was moved to the}} upper position, and the second return plotted. Ballistic calculation was performed by plotting the two points on an X-Y chart paper, and then moving mechanical cursors over the points. The rest of the calculation was carried out electronically.|$|R
5000|$|These {{were fairly}} simple systems {{consisting}} of an infra-red sensor with a horizontally rotating shutter {{in front of}} it. The shutter was slaved to a display under the main interception radar display in the cockpit, any IR light falling on the sensor would generate a [...] "pip" [...] on the display, in a fashion similar to the <b>B-scopes</b> used on early radars.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>B-scope</b> or b-scan {{provides}} a 2-D [...] "top down" [...] representation of space, with the vertical axis typically representing range and the horizontal axis azimuth (angle). <b>B-scope</b> displays were common in airborne radars in the 1950s and 60s, which were mechanically scanned {{from side to}} side, and sometimes {{up and down as}} well. The B-scope's display represented a horizontal [...] "slice" [...] of the airspace {{on both sides of the}} aircraft out to the tracking angles of the radar. The spot was swept up the Y-axis in a fashion similar to the A-scope's X-axis, with distances [...] "up" [...] the display indicating greater range. This signal was mixed with a varying voltage being generated by a mechanical device that depended on the current horizontal angle of the antenna. The result was essentially an A-scope whose range line was rotated to point up, and then rotated back and forth about a zero point at the bottom of the display. The radio signal was sent into the intensity channel, producing a bright spot on the display indicating returns.|$|E
50|$|A high-resolution, north-oriented, {{coloured}} {{radar picture}} is displayed on PC display. The radar display {{can either be}} in a Plan position indicators (PPI) display, or a <b>B-Scope</b> display. The display also has provision for digital geographic map overlay, which allows the target data to be integrated with tactical data for use by ground forces and commanders. Different geographical maps can be overlaid on the radar display. A target position can be marked for further investigation, or combing of the area by ground forces.|$|E
50|$|Programmable Signal Processor (PSP) - The core radar {{component}} {{which is}} responsible for signal processing, frequency selection, signal digitization for <b>B-Scope</b> display. The PSP is controlled through the F-16 Heads Down Display Set (HDDS) or what is commonly called the Multi-Function Displays (MFDs). The PSP is directed by the system operational flight program (OFP), which is controlled and modified for new threats or addition radar system requirements. The PSP also contains all the controls circuitry for radar A/A and A/G operational scan patterns and SAR/ISAR operation.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the earlier}} APQ-153, the APQ-159 was a purely air-to-air radar system. It had four primary modes of operation, two search modes with {{different}} ranges using a simple <b>B-Scope</b> display, a C-Scope gunnery display with ranging and automatic lock-on ("dogfight mode"), {{and a similar}} mode used with the AIM-9 Sidewinder that calculated the missile's engagement envelope and provided cues to the pilot to fly into the envelope. The radar offered no air-to-ground modes at all, nor was it capable of firing the AIM-7 Sparrow {{in spite of its}} BVR-capable range.|$|E
50|$|Helicopters appears like {{a rapidly}} pulsing noise emitter {{except in a}} clear {{environment}} free from clutter. An audible signal is produced for passive identification {{of the type of}} airborne object. Microwave Doppler frequency shift produced by reflector motion falls into the audible sound range for human beings (20 - 20,000 Hz), which is used for target classification in addition to the kinds of conventional radar display used for that purpose, like A-scope, <b>B-scope,</b> C-scope, and RHI indicator. The human ear may {{be able to tell the}} difference better than electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|When a round {{was fired}} it would {{penetrate}} the two beams in turn. Returns from both {{were sent to}} the same <b>B-scope</b> display, causing two blips to appear. When the first appeared, the operator would turn two hand wheels to move a horizontal and vertical lines on the display, the strobes, so they lay on top of the blip. They then waited for the round to appear in the upper beam, causing another blip to appear. This time they used a second set of wheels to move the strobes to the new location. The entire process takes as little as 20 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Ground-based radars {{like the}} SCR-584 {{automated}} this process {{early in their}} evolution. In search mode the SCR-584 rotated its antenna through 360 degrees and any returns were plotted on a plan position indicator (PPI). This gave the operators an indication of any targets within its ~25 mile detection range and their direction relative to the radar van. When one of the returns was considered interesting, the radar was flipped to tracking mode and [...] "locked-on". From then on it would automatically keep its antenna pointed at the target, feeding out accurate direction, altitude and range information on a <b>B-Scope</b> display. Operator workload was greatly reduced.|$|E
5000|$|The PPI display {{provides}} a 2-D [...] "all round" [...] {{display of the}} airspace around a radar site. The distance out {{from the center of}} the display indicates range, and the angle around the display is the azimuth to the target. The current position of the radar antenna is typically indicated by a line extending from the center to the outside of the display, which rotates along with the antenna in realtime. It is essentially a <b>B-scope</b> extended to 360 degrees. The PPI display is typically what people think of as a radar display in general, and was widely used in air traffic control until the introduction of raster displays in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|The H-scope {{is another}} {{modification}} of the <b>B-scope</b> concept, but displays elevation as well as azimuth and range. The elevation information is displayed by drawing a second [...] "blip" [...] offset from the target indicator by a short distance, {{the slope of the}} line between the two blips indicates the elevation relative to the radar. For instance, if the blip were displaced directly to the right this would indicate that the target is at the same elevation as the radar. The offset is created by dividing the radio signal into two, then slightly delaying one of the signals so it appears offset on the display. The angle was adjusted by delaying the time of the signal via a delay, the length of the delay being controlled by a voltage varying with the vertical position of the antenna. This sort of elevation display could be added to almost any of the other displays, and was often referred to as a [...] "double dot" [...] display.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the project is to simulate the real time Radar detection and tracking operations using MATLAB software. Radar system use modulated waveforms and directive antennas to transmit electromagnetic energy into a specific volume in space to search for targets. Objects (targets) within a search volume will reflect portions of this energy (radar returns or echoes) back to the radar. These echoes are then processed by radar receiver to extract target information such as range. Velocity, angular position, and other target identifying characteristics. The project mainly concentrates on the radar displays and different radar types to collect the information of the flying objects, such as the range, speed, distance, angles. The display types are A-scope, <b>B-scope,</b> C-scope, PPI, and RHI, which are used in modern radars. While others are either obsolete or are found only in very specialized applications. Signals displayed on these scopes can be raw video, synthetic video (detected video) or computer-generated symbols. The radar types consider in the project are CWT (Continuous Wave Transmission), Pulse, Doppler, and MTI (Moving Target Indicator). For each display, all the values related to the object are calculated in different patterns and graphs for the corresponding formulated values and angles...|$|E
