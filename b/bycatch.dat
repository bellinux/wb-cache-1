5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise <b>bycatch.</b> In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce <b>bycatch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler {{is a minor}} <b>bycatch</b> of inshore gillnet {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the meat is sold for human consumption. Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing. Therefore, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} cited human threat to birds is habitat loss. Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings or vehicles, long-line fishing <b>bycatch,</b> pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use), competition and predation from nonnative invasive species, and climate change.|$|E

40|$|The {{joint project}} between the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research (RIVO) and the Mauritanian Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries Research (IMROP) has been {{initiated}} in 1998 {{in order to}} strengthen Mauritaniaâ€™s capacity for research on stocks of small pelagic fish. Part of this project is the 'Scientific Observer Program' that monitors the catches (conserved and discarded) of the EU fishery for small pelagics in Mauritania. The EU pelagic fleet in Mauritania focuses their fisheries mainly on the group of sardinella, additional target species are horse mackerel, chub mackerel and pilchard. Still, the unwanted <b>bycatches</b> of non-commercial large animals such as sharks and dolphins is inevitable so far. This report describes the total <b>bycatches</b> of the pelagic megafauna by the EU pelagic fleet in the Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone during the year 2001. The current sampling of large <b>bycatches</b> appears {{to be full of}} shortcomings and the collected data are inadequate to apply for the evaluation {{of the impact of the}} EU pelagic fishery in Mauritania. Therefore it is concluded that the program needs to undergo a thorough renewal. Essential recommendations are given...|$|R
5|$|Various {{non-governmental}} organizations participate in marine conservation activism, wherein they {{draw attention to}} and aid in various problems in marine conservation, such as pollution, whaling, <b>bycatch,</b> and so forth. Notable organizations include the Greenpeace who focus on overfishing and whaling among other things, and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society who are known for taking direct-action tactics to expose illegal activity.|$|E
5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced {{a middle class}} that increased demand for traditional luxury items like shark fins. Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing crews to both take them from sharks in their <b>bycatch</b> and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as <b>bycatch</b> in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark <b>bycatch</b> of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E

In 2010, Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for manta and other rays, their retention as <b>bycatch,</b> and their sale.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky sharks are also caught as <b>bycatch</b> on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, are caught by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia.

25|$|Despite {{the large}} populations of bluespotted trevally, {{particularly}} in northern Australia, no major fishery is based around the species. They are taken by trawls and hook-and-line methods throughout their range, but form a considerable proportion of some prawn-trawler <b>bycatches.</b> Despite this, {{they are generally}} considered of no worth due to their mediocre reputation as table fish, {{as well as the}} possibility of ciguatera poisoning from larger specimens.|$|R
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, and is only infrequently taken, as <b>bycatch,</b> on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The oceanic whitetip is {{a commercially}} {{important}} species for its fins, meat, and oil. It is eaten fresh, smoked, dried, and salted and its hide {{is used for}} leather. It is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole rangealthough it is more often taken as <b>bycatch</b> than by design, since it is drawn to longline bait that is intended for other species.|$|E
5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but <b>bycatch</b> levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and <b>Bycatch</b> Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} <b>bycatches.</b> In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|R

5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as <b>bycatch</b> in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as <b>bycatch</b> in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common <b>bycatch</b> of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we studied an artisanal fishery {{targeting}} mainly soles (Solea senegalensis and Solea solea) and cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) with trammel nets. Catches of target species, <b>bycatches</b> and discards were studied from October 2004 until August 2005 {{in the west}} coast of Portugal. A total of 37 sampling surveys onboard commercial fishing vessels were conducted. The number and weight of individuals of all species caught were registered, as well as the amount discarded and retained by fishermen. A total of 112 species were identified: Scomber japonicus, Chelidonichthys obscura and Callioynimus lyra were the most discarded fishes, corresponding to 28 % in weight and 36 % in number of discards. Discards represented 22 %, in weight, of the total catches, while the amount retained by fishermen for consumption or direct selling was 12 %, also in weight. The overall estimate of the annual discards value due to this fishery was ca. 170 tonnes, comprising near 45 fishing vessels. Inconsistencies between the catches recorded onboard and the official landings were detected for the main target species. Some <b>bycatches</b> of species under recovery plans were also found...|$|R

5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent <b>bycatch</b> of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The <b>bycatch</b> of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} silky sharks are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as <b>bycatch</b> in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as <b>bycatch</b> (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch silky sharks.|$|E

40|$|The {{cetaceans}} of Ghana and the Gulf of Guinea have, until recently, remained unstudied. Periodical {{monitoring of}} artisanal fisheries for <b>bycatches</b> in seven Ghanaian artisanal fishing ports and landing sites over 1996 - 2004 has provided photographic and specimen evidence to validate occurrence of 18 species (17 odontocetes, 1 mysticete) in a tropical, predominantly pelagic cetacean fauna. At least nine species and subspecies {{had not previously}} been documented for Ghana (with asterisk), and four species are authenticated {{for the first time}} in the Gulf of Guinea (double asterisk), i. e. Tursiops truncatus, Stenella clymene, S. longirostris longirostris*, S. attenuata, S. frontalis, Delphinus capensis capensis*, Lagenodelphis hosei, Steno bredanensis, Grampus griseus, Peponocephala electra*, Feresa attenuata**, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Orcinus orca*, Pseudorca crassidens*, Kogia sima**, Physetermacrocephalus*, Ziphius cavirostris** and Megaptera novaeangliae. Also, the limited published information on distribution, natural history and conservation status is critically reviewed for each taxon. Indications are that most species encountered off Ghana may be widely distributed in the Gulf of Guinea, most notably the long-beaked common dolphin. The vulnerable Atlantic humpback dolphin, Sousa teuszii, remains unrecorded in Ghana and neighbouring nations despite apparently suitable coastal habitat. It is suggested that localized extinction may be blamed, possibly the result of accumulative <b>bycatches</b> and disturbance. A number of other cetacean species not yet encountered could occasionally occur in Ghanaâ€™s waters, e. g. Balaenoptera brydei, Mesoplodon densirostris, Kogia breviceps, Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus delphis </div...|$|R
