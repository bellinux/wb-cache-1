Several versions were available, including one piece and two piece suits. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front, neck or <b>back</b> <b>entry.</b> Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the neck opening and the hood over a grooved neck ring, and clamping {{with a large}} elastic O-ring. The two piece suit shirt and pants were also available separately and could be sealed together at the waist by a system similar to the neck entry suit.|$|E

50|$|Team Russia was {{the name}} of the Russian <b>backed</b> <b>entry</b> in the 2008-09 Volvo Ocean Race. Team Russia was founded by Oleg Zherebtsov, the founder of the Lenta {{hypermarket}} chain in Russia. Zherebstov met former Olympic sailor and professional skipper, Andreas Hanakamp, by chance during a sailing holiday in Croatia.The CEO of Team Russia is Michael Woods, who was Director of Race Operations for the 2001-02 race.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>back</b> <b>entries</b> are now {{generally}} considered to be a threat to home security. Accordingly Manchester City Council has, over recent years, helped residents by funding a [...] "gated alley" [...] response to the threat. When the majority of affected residents of a particular entry are in agreement the entries have iron gates set up at all ingress and egress points with all affected residents being issued a key.|$|R
60|$|But Letty {{clapped her}} hands, as if a {{brilliant}} idea had flashed upon her, and, {{running to the}} <b>back</b> <b>entry,</b> returned with a straw hat, brown and dusty, but shady, whole, and far more appropriate to the season than the ragged felt the man was eying hopelessly.|$|E
60|$|Rollo and Lucy {{hesitated a}} little, but they {{concluded}} {{to take their}} mother's advice at last, and went to Rollo's little library, and chose a book, and then {{went down to the}} <b>back</b> <b>entry,</b> and sat down there, on a long cricket, and began to read.|$|E
60|$|She heard {{steps on}} the gravel of the lane, and then two men talking, one of whom she knew to be Bolton. In a little while the <b>back</b> <b>entry</b> door was opened and shut, and after a brief murmur of voices in the library Mrs. Bolton knocked on the door-jamb of the room where Annie sat.|$|E
50|$|Dog/Pet and {{underwater}} pet treatment treadmills {{are available}} for both home and clinical use. A variety of makes and models are available, but key features of treadmills designed for pet use include a longer running surface, open front and <b>back</b> <b>entries</b> and side rails to prevent the pet from falling off the treadmill. None {{are designed to be}} used without human supervision. Many veterinary and animal rehabilitation clinics also offer underwater treadmill therapy as part of their services provided to clients' pets.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the streets which contain these {{terraces}} are typical of the area and consist of grid layouts intersected with wide <b>back</b> <b>entries</b> which run {{the length of the}} terrace blocks at the rear and {{at each end of the}} block. This alley/back-entry layout is supposed to be because of an old by-law of the Levenshulme local authority that every terraced house had to have a front garden and allow access to the back door by a horse and cart to enable rubbish to be removed without the need enter the house.|$|R
50|$|The Enforcement Directorate raided several forex establishments making <b>back</b> dated <b>entries.</b> Money {{laundering}} using backdated accounting {{was carried}} out by co-operative banks, jewellers, sellers of iPhones, and several other businesses.|$|R
60|$|She {{put on her}} hat {{and jacket}} as noiselessly as possible, {{and going to the}} <b>back</b> <b>entry</b> window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a {{roundabout}} way to the road. Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mercy on us, {{there are}} hundreds! Run {{and put a}} tub in the <b>back</b> <b>entry</b> for their {{umbrellas}} to drip into. Tell them {{to go down the}} hall and leave them, and pile their hats on the table; the tree won't hold them all. No use to get mats; my poor carpets!' And down went Mrs Jo to prepare for the invasion, while Josie and the maids flew about dismayed at the prospect of so many muddy boots.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{liked the}} idea of seeing the freshet, too, very much; though she said she was afraid it would be too wet for her to go. Rollo told her never to fear, for his father would {{contrive}} some way to get her down there safely, and they both went to the <b>back</b> <b>entry</b> door again, looking out, and wishing now that it would rain faster and faster, as they did before dinner that it would cease to rain.|$|E
50|$|John and Nancy Yeatts House is a {{historic}} home located near Chatham, Pittsylvania County, Virginia. The log double pen house was built in two sections with the original section built about 1808, and expanded probably in the 1820s but before 1860. The original section has v-notched logs, a stone gable end chimney, and front and <b>back</b> <b>entries.</b> The later section is of similar construction and also has a stone gable end chimney. The two sections are topped by a standing seam metal gable roof. It is representative of a finely crafted and well-preserved vernacular log dwelling.|$|R

2500|$|The rules {{state that}} the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry. [...] Strictly speaking, it is {{physically}} impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water. [...] Divers therefore attempt {{to create the illusion}} of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements. For <b>back</b> <b>entries,</b> one technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically. This is called [...] "Pike save". [...] Another is to use [...] "knee save" [...] movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs.|$|R
60|$|Rollo ought, now, when {{he found}} {{that he must be}} {{disappointed}} about his ride, to have immediately banished it from his mind altogether, and turned his thoughts to other pleasures; but like all ill-humored people, he would keep thinking and talking, all the time, about the thing which caused his ill-humor. So he sat in a large <b>back</b> <b>entry,</b> where he and Lucy were, looking out at the door, and saying a great many ill-natured things about the weather, and his father's giving up the ride just for a little sprinkling of rain that would not last half an hour. He said it was a shame, too, for it to rain that day, just because he was going to ride.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} {{that it would be}} a good plan for you fellows to have a museum of your own; a place in which to collect all the curious and interesting things that you find, and make, and have given you. Mrs. Jo is too kind to complain, but it is rather hard for her to have the house littered up with all sorts of rattletraps, half-a-pint of dor-bugs in one of her best vases, for instance, a couple of dead bats nailed up in the <b>back</b> <b>entry,</b> wasps nests tumbling down on people's heads, and stones lying round everywhere, enough to pave the avenue. There are not many women who would stand that sort of thing, are there, now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The supper was not romantic, but the {{situation}} was, and Emily found that pie ambrosial food eaten with the man she loved, whose eyes talked more eloquently than the tongue just then busy with a doughnut. Ruth kept away, but glanced at them as she served her company, and her own happy experience helped her to see that all was going well in that quarter. Saul and Sophie emerged from the <b>back</b> <b>entry</b> with shining countenances, but carefully avoided {{each other for the}} rest of the evening. No one observed this but Aunt Plumy from the recesses of her pantry, and she folded her hands as if well content, as she murmured fervently over a pan full of crullers, [...] "Bless the dears! Now I can die happy." ...|$|E

6000|$|A pause came at last, however, {{and fans}} fluttered, heated brows were wiped, jokes were made, lovers {{exchanged}} confidences, and {{every nook and}} corner held a man and maid carrying on the sweet game which is never out of fashion. There was a glitter of gold lace in the <b>back</b> <b>entry,</b> and a train of blue and primrose shone in the dim light. There was a richer crimson {{than that of the}} geraniums in the deep window, and a dainty shoe tapped the bare floor impatiently as the brilliant black eyes looked everywhere for the court gentleman, while their owner listened to the gruff prattle of an enamored boy. But in the upper hall walked a little white ghost as if waiting for some shadowy companion, and when a dark form appeared ran to take its arm, saying, in a tone of soft satisfaction,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Unless {{people are}} more than {{commonly}} disagreeable, it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them. The better part of my companion's character, if it have a better part, is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognise the man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits, and as my position in reference to them, being paternal and protective, was favourable {{to the growth of}} friendly sentiments, I soon grew to like them all. It was pleasant in the summer forenoons--when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems--it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the <b>back</b> <b>entry,</b> a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their lips. Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children; the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humour, {{has little to do with}} the matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey, mouldering trunk. In one case, however, it is real sunshine; in the other, it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood.|$|E
5000|$|The M-505 Adams Brothers Probe 16 was a car, {{designed}} by former Marcos cars designers Dennis and Peter Adams, (Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire England) in 1969 as 'an investigation into extremes of styling'.

50|$|The Krechet was a rear-entry suit, {{meaning that}} cosmonauts {{would enter the}} suit through a hatch in the <b>back.</b> This <b>entry</b> was easier and more {{reliable}} than {{the use of a}} zipper. The hatch could then be opened by means of a lever by the right elbow. The life support backpack was incorporated into the hatch. The rear-entry hatch concept is attributed to Zvezda engineer Anatoli Stoklitskii.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} can seat four crew members, three {{officers and}} one enlisted aircrewman, with {{the pilot and}} the copilot/tactical coordinator (COTAC) {{in the front of}} the cockpit and the tactical coordinator (TACCO) and sensor operator (SENSO) in the <b>back.</b> <b>Entry</b> is by an entry door / ladder which folds out of the side of the fuselage. When the aircraft's anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role ended in the late 1990s, the enlisted SENSOs were removed from the crew. In the tanking crew configuration, the S-3B typically flew with a pilot and co-pilot/COTAC. The wing is fitted with leading edge and Fowler flaps. Spoilers are fitted to both the upper and the lower surfaces of the wings. All control surfaces are actuated by dual hydraulically boosted irreversible systems. In the event of dual hydraulic failures, an Emergency Flight Control System (EFCS) permits manual control with greatly increased stick forces and reduced control authority.|$|E
