5|$|On 7 January 1971 MACV was {{authorized}} to begin detailed planning {{for an attack}} against PAVN Base Areas 604 and 611. The task {{was given to the}} commander of XXIV Corps, Lieutenant General James W. Sutherland, Jr., who had only nine days to submit it to MACV for approval. The operation would consist of four phases. During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along Route 9 toward the Laotian town of Tchepone, the perceived nexus of <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 604. This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column. During the third phase, search and destroy operations within <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 604 would be carried out and finally, the South Vietnamese force would retire either back along Route 9 or through <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 611 and exit through the A Shau Valley. It was hoped that the force could remain in Laos until the rainy season was underway at the beginning of May.|$|E
5|$|In February and March 1972, South Vietnamese units {{patrolling the}} {{international}} border with Cambodia detected increased Communist {{activity in the}} Fishhook area, most notably {{the presence of the}} Viet Cong 5th Division in an area north of Bình Long Province. On 13 March, a South Vietnamese mechanized task force operating in Cambodia discovered a huge depot which contained large quantities of assault rifles, machine guns, rockets, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition in <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 354 (Svay Rieng Province) and <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 708 (Kampong Cham Province). On 27 March, a Việt Cộng deserter from a reconnaissance company of the 7th Division revealed that his unit was surveying a portion of road between Tây Ninh and Bình Long in preparation for its next move. Between 27 March and 1 April, more enemy prisoners and documents were captured by the South Vietnamese army, which revealed that the Viet Cong's 7th and 9th Divisions were coordinating their efforts against an unidentified target.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining forces}} with {{communist}} guerrillas, one of Peng's first actions was to save Mao, whose forces were being encircled by Kuomintang units: Peng broke the encirclement {{and drove the}} enemy off. Peng then met with Zhu and Mao, and they reorganized their forces and decided to form a <b>base</b> <b>area</b> around the Ruijin, Jiangxi, an agricultural city that was only defended by weak warlord units. Zhu and Mao occupied the area, informally beginning the Jiangxi Soviet in January 1929.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March 1969, on secret {{orders from}} Nixon, the U.S. Air Force {{carried out the}} bombing of <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 353 (in the Fishhook region {{opposite}} South Vietnam's Tây Ninh Province) by 59 B-52 Stratofortress bombers. This strike {{was the first in}} a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During Operation Menu, the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas. Only five high-ranking Congressional officials were informed of the bombing.|$|E
5|$|Attached to US forces, 1 RAR was {{primarily}} employed in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery {{into an area}} of operations, and to support them with aerial mobility, fire support, casualty evacuation, and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist <b>base</b> <b>area</b> at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E
5|$|By 5 November, General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area (SWPA) {{had decided}} that the Finschhafen area would be {{developed}} into a major air and naval base, but the large Japanese force on Sattelberg still overlooked the <b>base</b> <b>area.</b> In order to remove this threat, Wootten sent the 26th Infantry Brigade to capture Sattelberg on 16 November. On 25 November, after 10 days of fighting, and an advance up the southern approaches from Jivevaneng by infantry supported by artillery, armour and air support, Sattelberg was seized by the Australians. Having suffered heavy casualties, and short on supplies, the Japanese withdrew north to Wareo, where they established themselves in preparation for further attacks by the Australians.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Cypriot {{accession}} to the EU in 2004, EU law {{did not apply}} to the sovereign <b>base</b> <b>areas.</b> This position was changed by the Cypriot accession treaty and EU law, while still not applying in principle, applies to the extent necessary to implement a protocol attached to that treaty. This protocol applies EU law relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, customs, indirect taxation, social policy and justice and home affairs to the sovereign <b>base</b> <b>areas.</b> The sovereign <b>base</b> areas' authorities have also made provision for the unilateral application of directly applicable EU law. [...] The UK also agreed in the Protocol to keep enough control of the external (i.e. off-island and northern Cyprus) borders of the <b>base</b> <b>areas</b> to ensure that the border between the sovereign <b>base</b> <b>areas</b> and the Republic of Cyprus can remain fully open and will not have to be policed as an external EU border. Consequently, the sovereign <b>base</b> <b>areas</b> will become a de facto part of the Schengen Area if and when Cyprus implements it. The <b>base</b> <b>areas</b> are already de facto members of the eurozone due to their previous use of the Cypriot pound before it was replaced by the euro in 2008.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{significantly}} underestimating {{the size}} of the position they faced, the Australians had succeeded in the pushing D445 VC Battalion and 3/33 NVA Regiment out of a valuable <b>base</b> <b>area</b> intended for long-term use. Regardless, there were few other tangible results to show for the casualties they had incurred as, although numerous blood trails and body parts scattered around the battlefield indicated that communist casualties had been heavy, the majority of their dead had either been removed from the battlefield or were entombed in the bunkers that had been crushed by the Australian tanks. The battle had cost the Australians three killed and six wounded, while only five Viet Cong bodies were recovered.|$|E
5|$|During February 1966, {{as part of}} an American road-building program {{designed}} to challenge the Viet Cong's ability to manoeuvre in the areas around Saigon, the US 1st Engineer Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Sargent—had been engaged in constructing an all-weather road between Route 13 and Route 15 in central Binh Duong Province, west of Ben Cat, on the northern apex of the Viet Cong <b>base</b> <b>area</b> known as the Iron Triangle. This road was planned to cut the communist supply routes between War Zone C, the Mekong Delta, the Iron Triangle and War Zone D, while it would also link the two forward brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division between Phuoc Vinh and Lai Khe and help to extend the authority of the South Vietnamese government.|$|E
5|$|In the II Corps area, Operation Binh Tay I (Operation Tame the West) was {{launched}} by the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and the 40th ARVN Infantry Regiment against <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 702 (the traditional headquarters of the communist B-2 Front) in northeastern Cambodia from 5–25 May. Following airstrikes, the initial American forces, assaulting via helicopter, were driven back by intense anti-aircraft fire. On the following day, the 3rd Battalion, 506th Infantry (on loan from the U.S. 101st Airborne Division), landed without opposition. Its sister unit, the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry was also unopposed. The 3rd Battalion of the 8th Infantry, however, inserted only 60 men before intense PAVN fire (which shot down one helicopter and damaged two others) shut down the landing zone, leaving them stranded and surrounded overnight. By the following morning, PAVN forces had left the area.|$|E

5|$|MACV intelligence, on {{the other}} hand was {{convinced}} that the incursion would be only lightly opposed. Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would neutralize the estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the DMZ, and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them {{for the duration of the}} operation. Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from <b>Base</b> <b>Area</b> 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range.|$|E
5|$|Peng was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Mao's rise to power during the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. Peng continued to consolidate the communists' <b>base</b> <b>area</b> after arriving in Shaanxi, campaigning in neighboring Shanxi and Gansu. In April 1937, Peng was named vice commander-in-chief of all Chinese communist forces, outranked only by Zhu De, who was named commander-in-chief. Peng's promotion was supported by Lin Biao, who had been actively supporting Peng for promotions to senior leadership as early as May 1934. In early 1935 Lin responded to widespread discontent within the Red Army over Mao's evasive tactics (which were perceived inside the Red Army as unnecessarily exhausting) by publicly proposing that Peng take overall command of the Red Army; but Mao, who had recently been promoted to the position, attacked Peng and Lin for challenging him and successfully retained his position.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong {{apparently}} suffered light casualties {{with only}} 32 soldiers officially confirmed killed, {{and they did}} not leave a single casualty on the battlefield. In recognition of the 271st Regiment's performance during the Bình Giã campaign, the NLF High Command bestowed the title 'Bình Giã Regiment' on the unit to honour their achievement. Following the Bình Giã campaign, the Viet Cong went on to occupy Hoài Đức District and the strategic hamlets of Đất Đỏ, Long Thành and Nhơn Trạch along Inter-provincial Road No. 2 and 15. They also expanded the Hát Dịch <b>base</b> <b>area,</b> which was located in Bà Rịa and Bình Thuận Provinces, to protect the important sea transportation routes used by the Vietnam People's Navy to supply Viet Cong units around the regions of the Mekong River.|$|E

5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their <b>base</b> <b>area</b> was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.|$|E
5|$|General Hay {{initially}} portrayed Ong Thanh as an American {{victory and}} cited 101 enemy {{dead in the}} battle. However, American veterans who survived the ordeals of the battle were adamant they were ambushed and defeated by the Viet Cong's 271st Regiment. The estimate of 101 enemy dead officially provided by the U.S. military was likely much inflated to emphasize {{the scale of the}} 'American victory'. For retired U.S. Army Brigadier General James E. Shelton, who was then a major and served as an Operations Officer with the 2nd Battalion, the lack of reliable intelligence and overconfidence on the part of Allen as the battalion commander, were some of the factors that led to the disastrous outcome in the Ong Thanh battle. Furthermore, the American soldiers under Allen's command lacked fighting experience, whereas the Viet Cong soldiers of the 9th Division were tough and experienced light infantry. The Viet Cong 271st Regiment, after their victory at Ong Thanh, withdrew back towards their <b>base</b> <b>area</b> near the Cambodian border.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 February 6 RAR deployed into the area north-west of Hoi My by American UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) {{in an attempt to}} cut off the anticipated Viet Cong withdrawal, establishing blocking and assault forces. Following an airmobile assault into an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, A Company 6 RAR was subsequently surprised by a strong, well-sited and dug-in Viet Cong force, which, rather than withdrawing, had likely remained in location as part of an attempt to ambush any reaction force sent to the area. The Australians were soon contacted by heavy small arms fire, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. A Company subsequently broke contact and withdrew under heavy fire from {{what appeared to be a}} Viet Cong <b>base</b> <b>area.</b> Initially believing they were opposed by only a company, 6 RAR subsequently launched a quick attack by two companies. However, unknown to the Australians the Viet Cong had been reinforced and they now faced a battalion-sized force in well prepared positions.|$|E

Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy these force before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{importance}} of safety-monitoring systems was highlighted by the unprecedented collision between a ship and a jetty in Yeosu.
