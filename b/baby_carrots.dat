5000|$|Grimmway Farms traces {{its history}} to the mid-1960s, when Rodney Grimm, who was in college, and Robert Grimm, who was only in eighth grade, started farming five acres of sweet corn on their grandfather's chicken farm in Anaheim, California. Their first {{employees}} were their cousins and two sisters, who sold the corn from produce stands along the roadside. Through the years, they added other crops, but by the late 1970s, Rod and Robert became deeply in debt. In the early 1980s, the brothers saw a promising future in the carrot farming business in the San Joaquin Valley, so they relocated to Kern County. [...] "After the concept of <b>baby</b> <b>carrots</b> was successfully test-marketed by another company in Los Angeles, 'it quickly turned into a race to see which processors could put in equipment fast enough to serve the emerging market,' Robert Grimm later recalled. He considered the name 'a happy accident' for the <b>baby</b> <b>carrots,</b> while it did nothing to dissuade shoppers from thinking they were buying an immature root vegetable." [...] By the mid-1990s, the company was able to process millions of pounds of <b>baby</b> <b>carrots</b> a day.|$|E

"Caropak" was studied under four population densities, three different number of lines per bed and harvested under three root size harvest parameters in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Four phases in the <b>baby</b> style <b>carrot</b> process were evaluated. Length of the roots at harvest and projected values for total waste and marketable yield were estimated. Length was affected by root size at harvest, the most desirable root length occurred when harvested at 25 - 35 % roots diameter > 2 cm.

30|$|All {{subjects}} {{received a}} capsule 0.5 – 1  h {{before the start}} of the race with a cup of water and were observed to swallow the capsule. They were also provided and observed to take another capsule at the 90 -km aid station. Capsules were prepared by the investigators using riboflavin (Nature’s Way Products, Inc., Green Bay, WI), maltodextrin (Now, Bloomingdale, IL), and 10 % ß-carotene powder (BulkSupplements.com, Henderson, NV). The treatment group received capsules containing 100  mg of riboflavin, and the control group received capsules containing 95  mg of maltodextrin and 5  mg of 10 % ß-carotene. Because riboflavin can cause urine to appear bright or fluorescent yellow [37] and might allow subjects to suspect they were in the treatment group, the small amount of ß-carotene was added to the placebo, as done in a prior placebo-controlled trial of riboflavin [27], since it can also cause a similar urine color change. The amount of ß-carotene in each capsule was approximately half of that in a single large raw <b>baby</b> <b>carrot</b> [38], so we recognize it was unlikely to cause marked urine discoloration, but it did allow us to legitimately tell the subjects that they might notice a discoloration of the urine regardless of their group assignment. We also recognized that ß-carotene is an antioxidant but felt that it would have no recognizable antioxidant effect at such a low dose.|$|R

50|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, thinning is the selective removal of flowers, fruits, shoots, and seedlings or young plants to allow adequate {{space for the}} remaining organs/plants to grow efficiently. In large-scale farming, techniques like precision seeding and transplanting can {{eliminate the need for}} thinning by starting plants at their optimum spacing. On a smaller scale, such as a home vegetable garden, thinning {{can be used as a}} way to make maximum use of space for certain crops. For example, beets, carrots, green onions and others can be planted densely, and then thinned to make room for continued growth of the plants left in the soil, and also as a harvest of baby vegetables (beet greens, <b>baby</b> <b>carrots,</b> baby onions). Also thinning is used in post harvesting.|$|E
5000|$|Red cherry shrimp are {{primarily}} biofilm and algae eaters. They will eat any food intended for aquarium use, but some will prefer compressed algae discs (algae wafers).

Uneaten vegetables can very quickly decompose and create water quality problems.To keep a clean substrate, some shrimp keepers put a glass bowl or glass plate on the bottom for the food. If feeding commercial fish/shrimp food ensure that there is no copper added (some breeders avoid only pure/elemental copper [...] ) as this is dangerous for shrimp. Many breeders think copper sulfates, found in most fish food, are tolerated in low amounts. Copper sulfates found in snail killer are in high amounts and will kill shrimp.|$|E

Benson then asks Skips if he made any progress; he replies that he didn't, as he couldn't find a signal, and is annoyed because he got extended coverage on his phone, and Fives replies [...] "Typical". Eileen still holds up the pan and says they could use it to boost a signal, and Benson agrees, acknowledging her for having a plan. He tells everyone to help Eileen and for her to grab whatever she needs, and then wonders where Mordecai and Rigby are.They are staring out at the Earth from a hatch in a room with space carts and the robots from the last experiments on a wall, as well as one of the jet like structures they used then and recently. Then they start messing with the space carts. Rigby presses random buttons and starts taking off. Mordecai, who doesn't seem to have touched any, takes off as well. For a bit, they seem confused, and Mordecai says that they are hard to control, but they seem to get the hang of it soon enough. At least, until Rigby cracks one of the jet-like structures going by it, and then they knock over some other vehicles, and finally get ejected. Mordecai wonder what if they were stuck in space forever, and Rigby answers that it might not be so bad, saying they have the park and all the stuff they normally have. Then he says he has Eileen, but comes to a very awkward pause when he is about to say who Mordecai has (the latter makes a weird face about it), soon to recover by saying that he has him. He also points out the space ships, and says that they can become space pilots (like in the movie), but then doesn't remember if that timeline is gone or not. Mordecai says that they will probably go back to Earth anyway, and they laugh it off. Suddenly, Benson comes and demands to know what they are up to, telling them that no has heard from them for 2 hours. Mordecai apologizes, telling Benson they were exploring when they found the carts, and Rigby throws in that they were already crashed, but Benson doesn't seem to care.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the quality influencing processing steps based on the processes of <b>carrot</b> <b>baby</b> food. Once the processing conditions were identified, the possibilities for alternative processing techniques will be explored to improve the overall product and process quality. Next to the food safety (hazard) in the food processing the quality aspect is getting more and more important and an analyse system to optimise the process needs to be established (QualityAnalysisCriticalControlPoint). Organic carrots (Daucus carota, Maestro variety) were processed in a pilot plant trail according a carrot puree process typical in baby food industry. The samples differed regarding the treatment of the raw material prior the sterilization process. Different factors affecting the process like processing time and temperature were documented. It can be concluded that the treatment of the raw material prior the sterilization process can be a critical point according to the process quality. Also great variations in inside temperature are possible among the samples going through the sterilization process.
