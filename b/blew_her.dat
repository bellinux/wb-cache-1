5|$|During World War II, she {{was used}} to lay mines in the North Sea, to provide gunfire support to ground troops, and as a convoy escort and {{training}} ship for cadets. She participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940, Her wartime career ended in Kiel in April 1945, when British bombers badly damaged the ship while she was in dock for repairs. Her crew ran her aground to prevent her from sinking, and ultimately <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> up with demolition charges to prevent the Allies from capturing her in May. The wreck was eventually scrapped in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Emden {{departed}} Pillau on 1 February, {{bound for}} Kiel. She arrived on 7 February 1945 {{and was taken}} into the Deutsche Werke dockyard to complete the necessary repairs. British bombers attacked the ship twice and damaged her badly. The ship was listing heavily, and so on 14 April, she was towed out into Heikendorfer Bay and run aground. The Germans then <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> up on 3 May to prevent the Allies from capturing the ship. The wreck was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1949. Her bow ornament is currently {{on display in the}} Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} sank {{only one}} ship, a Greek cargo ship in May 1915, {{but she had}} earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March. U-12 also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship Jean Bart in December 1914. While searching for targets {{in the vicinity of}} Venice in August 1915, U-12 struck a mine that <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> stern off, and sank with all hands, becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred U-12s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.|$|E

60|$|The wind {{continued}} to blow, and the steamer {{continued to}} float and float and float away. A wind {{had come up}} in the night. It had blown Bertha near me; perhaps it had <b>blown</b> <b>her</b> very near me. She had not known it, and I had not known it. Mary Phillips had not known it until it was too late, and now that wind had <b>blown</b> <b>her</b> past me and was <b>blowing</b> <b>her</b> away. For a time there was a flutter of a handkerchief, but only one handkerchief, and then La Fidélité, with Bertha on board, was blown away until she disappeared, and I never saw her again.|$|R

25|$|Then a torpedo struck Attack {{amidships}} and <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> {{into two}} pieces, {{both of which}} sank with five to seven minutes. The explosion ruptured Attacks bunkers, spilling tons of thick, black bunker fuel oil into the sea as she sank. Hundreds of men were in the water, {{and many of them}} became covered in oil or overcome by its fumes.|$|E

25|$|She {{apparently}} <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> {{nose into}} the handkerchief and then threw {{the piece of}} cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to {{the shock of the}} court.

Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as Ní Mháille spoke no English and Elizabeth spoke no Irish.|$|E
25|$|On 18 August 1806 Lieutenant M'Culloch used Galateas barge {{to pursue}} a {{schooner}} several miles up a river near Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. The schooner resisted the boarding party until she lost her commandeer and a crew member, at which time she surrendered. She {{proved to be a}} Spanish privateer with three long 6 and 4-pounders, some swivel guns, and musketoons. M'Culloch <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> up as he could not safely bring her out. He did return with the prisoners. Galatea suffered one man wounded in the affair.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a series of ear-splitting explosions, as Fame dropped a pattern of 10 depth charges. The lights in U-353 went out and water entered forward and aft through the {{hydrophone}} shafts. The electric motors stopped working, {{all but one of the}} depth gauges broke, and the aft hydroplanes were put out of action. U-353 went deeper, almost out of control as water poured in through the stern torpedo tube causing her to lose trim. The U-boat <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> tanks and surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.|$|E

25|$|Kamikaze {{successfully}} completed several more escort operations through {{the remainder of}} June and July. Notably, she engaged the submarine USS Hawkbill on July 18. The submarine attempted to torpedo a convoy {{off the coast of}} Malaya. The torpedoes missed and Kamikaze gave chase, dropping several depth charges that severely damaged the submarine and partially <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> out of the water. The Hawkbill was able to get away, and after the war the ships' captains, Hitoshi Kasuga and Worth M. Scanland exchanged letters praising each other. At the time of the surrender of Japan, she was still based in Singapore, and was turned over to British authorities there.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 1811 Amethyst was {{anchored}} in Plymouth Sound, intending to sail {{the next day}} join the fleet off Brest with provisions, including live bullocks. To facilitate her departure Walton decided to use only her bower anchor. A heavy storm caught her and <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> on shore near Cony Cliff Rocks, Mount Batten, before her crew could lower a second anchor. Lines were passed to the shore that enabled most of the crew to reach safety, though eight men did die. Most of the ship's stores were salvaged {{over the next few}} days. Still, the ship was too badly damaged to salvage and by 10 March wave action had broken up the hull.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E

25|$|Merging {{with the}} Norfolk & Western Railway {{prompted}} the steam program to acquire and overhaul Norfolk & Western 611 in 1982, and Norfolk & Western 1218 in 1987. These two locomotives and 765 joined the steam program veterans – Southern Railway 4501, Savannah and Atlanta Railway 750, Nickel Plate 587, Louisville & Nashville 152, Atlanta and West Point 290, Tennessee Valley Railroad 610, and Frisco 1522 – for an extensive series of excursions throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. Norfolk Southern's management {{was forced to}} end the program in late 1994 citing safety concerns, rising insurance costs, the expense of maintaining the steam locomotives, and decreasing rail network availability due to a surge in freight traffic. On December 3, 1994, the 611 became the last steam locomotive running on Norfolk Southern's trackage, running her last steam-powered excursion round-trip between Birmingham, Alabama and Chattanooga, Tennessee. After that, the 611 went on a three-day ferry move from Birmingham to Roanoke, Virginia. She stopped at Atlanta, Georgia for the night on December 5 and next to Salisbury, NC the next day on December 6. Finally, the 611 departed Salisbury and continued her final trip. When the engine arrived back in Roanoke, 611 <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> whistle one last time and had her fire put out.|$|E

500|$|SM U-12 {{was built}} on {{speculation}} by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume under the name SS-3. She was laid down in 1909 and launched in March 1911 and featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems from the Holland design of her older sister boats, U-5 and U-6. Whitehead's tried selling SS-3 to several different navies, but she was finally bought by the Austro-Hungarian Navy after the outbreak of World War I, despite having been rejected twice before. She was commissioned as U-12 in August 1914. She sank only one ship during the war, a Greek cargo ship in May 1915, but had earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March.
