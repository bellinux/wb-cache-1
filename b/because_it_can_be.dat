5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as {{critical to the}} moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E

5|$|Lawrencium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. It is {{named in honor}} of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements. A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11hours, but the shorter-lived 260Lr (half-life 2.7minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> produced on a larger scale.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> produced on a larger scale.|$|E

5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of mendelevium are known, {{with mass}} numbers from 245 to 260; all are radioactive. Additionally, five nuclear isomers are known: 245mMd, 247mMd, 249mMd, 254mMd, and 258mMd. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 258Md with a half-life of 51.5days, and the longest-lived isomer is 258mMd with a half-life of 58.0minutes. Nevertheless, the slightly shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) {{is more often}} used in chemical experimentation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> produced in larger quantities from alpha particle irradiation of einsteinium. After 258Md, the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, 257Md with a half-life of 5.52hours, 259Md with a half-life of 1.60hours, and 256Md with a half-life of 1.17hours. All of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half-lives that are less than an hour, {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives that are less than 5minutes.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined {{with the high}} mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{isotopes}} of nobelium are known, {{with mass}} numbers 250–260 and 262; all are radioactive. Additionally, nuclear isomers {{are known for}} mass numbers 251, 253, and 254. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 259No with a half-life of 58minutes, and the longest-lived isomer is 251mNo with a half-life of 1.7seconds. However, the still undiscovered isotope 261No is predicted to have a still longer half-life of 170min. Additionally, the shorter-lived 255No (half-life 3.1minutes) is more often used in chemical experimentation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium-249 with carbon-12 ions. After 259No and 255No, the next most stable nobelium isotopes are 253No (half-life 1.62minutes), 254No (51seconds), 257No (25seconds), 256No (2.91seconds), and 252No (2.57seconds). All of the remaining nobelium isotopes have half-lives that are less than a second, and the shortest-lived known nobelium isotope (250No) has a half-life of only 0.25milliseconds. The isotope 254No is especially interesting theoretically {{as it is in}} the middle of a series of prolate nuclei from 231Pa to 279Rg, and the formation of its nuclear isomers (of which two are known) is controlled by proton orbitals such as 2f5/2 which come just above the spherical proton shell; it can be synthesized in the reaction of 208Pb with 48Ca.|$|E
