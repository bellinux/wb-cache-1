5|$|Gair has now {{developed}} a style {{as a body}} painter. Her typical job takes her and her team eight hours, but some jobs take twice that. She does not charge <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> Gair is always well prepared for her jobs, but does not generally sketch her work on paper. In fact, she claims to have only had to do so twice in over twenty years of body painting. When she needs to test something out she usually uses her opposite (left) arm or hand.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E
5|$|John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{is shown}} {{working in an}} office {{building}} for a box company. He has a cruel manager named Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) who is constantly taunting and demeaning Locke. At one point Locke tells Randy off and feels great about it. He tells a woman named Helen on the phone about it, but it is revealed that she charges <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> to talk with Locke, {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. Locke reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E

He later joined other Spanish partners in establishing a firm that hooked up homes for natural gas. In 1994, he and Sergio Tasselli took part in the privatization of Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales in Rio Turbio, a mine where an accident later took the lives of many miners.|$|E

A Bicycle Rental business rents bikes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> nearby on the East side of Downtown. Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan, and Oakland's Measure DD park improvement plan for Lake Merritt calls for an automobile lane reduction and re-striping of bike lanes onto two of the district's streets: Lakeside Drive and Madison Street, and on nearby Webster and Franklin Streets, North of 14th Street. The plan also calls for the installation of a separated class one bikeway and multi-use trail immediately {{around the perimeter of}} Lake Merritt, and class two bicycle lanes on all arterial streets surrounding the lake, such as Grand Avenue, between Harrison and Macarthur, where a bike lane already exists, and on Lakeshore Boulevard, onto which a bicycle lane has been planned and contracted to be striped.|$|E
50|$|Households are {{suppliers}} of labour. In microeconomic theory, people {{are assumed to}} be rational and seeking to maximize their utility function.

It does seem the wrong name to apply to it... In Parsifal there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the stage in one spot and practices <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> while first one and then another of the cast endures what he can of it and then retires to die." ...|$|E
500|$|Long-haul {{drivers are}} {{normally}} {{paid by the}} mile, not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> Legally, truck drivers {{are not required to}} receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the standard 40-hour work week. Some drivers may choose to violate the HOS to earn more money. Being paid by the mile, any work performed that is not actual driving is of no value to the driver, providing incentive to falsify {{the amount of time spent}} performing non-driving duties. Drivers who falsify their log books often under-report their non-driving duties (such as waiting to be loaded and unloaded) which they are not paid for, and under-report their driving time or total miles. Many drivers who receive mileage pay are not paid by logged miles or actual miles, instead, motor carriers use computer mapping software (such as PC Miler) or published mileage guides (such as the Rand McNally Household Goods Carriers' Bureau Mileage Guide). PATT suggests that paying all drivers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> would reduce HOS violations by removing the incentive to [...] "cheat the system" [...] by driving more miles than are being logged. Surveys by OOIDA report 80% of drivers are not paid for waiting times while loading and unloading, and the majority of those drivers log these times as off-duty (while regulations require they be logged as on-duty). These same drivers reported they would log these times as on-duty if they were paid reasonably for such delays.|$|E
500|$|Feller again led {{the majors}} in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season.

[...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70.
