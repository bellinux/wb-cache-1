There is an additional connection for the speaker in a broadcast call or the first speaker in a voice group call up to {{the point at which the}} network decides to transfer them to a common channel. Additional connections may also be required for any mobile stations in the voice group or broadcast call which the network decides to place on a dedicated connection.

40|$|In many blind source {{separation}} (<b>BSS)</b> <b>applications,</b> {{especially for}} biomedical signal processing, there are specific expectations regarding the {{spatial and temporal}} characteristics of some sources, but post-hoc comparisons between source estimates and anticipated outcomes can be complicated and unreliable. One alternative is to incorporate additional prior knowledge, e. g., about the spatial topography of selected source sensor projections, into the BSS approach by means of constraints.

We propose a new method, called JD+QR, to solve such a problem. The nonnegativity constraint is imposed {{by means of a}} square change of variable. Then the high-dimensional optimization problem is decomposed into several sequential rational subproblems using QR matrix factorization.

30|$|Basically, hyperspectral unmixing is {{a problem}} of blind source {{separation}} (BSS). However, compared with most <b>BSS</b> <b>applications,</b> the endmembers of HSI data are dependent and the elements in A and S are nonnegative, so the hyperspectral unmixing is beyond the reach of many BSS algorithms (e.g., independent component analysis-ICA) [1]. To fulfill these constraints, numerous special algorithms have been proposed to solve the hyperspectral unmixing problem under the LSMM assumption, including the approaches of convex geometry, Bayesian source separation, and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The geometrical approaches first determine the endmembers and estimate the abundances in a second step, while the BSS and NMF-based approaches find the endmembers and the abundances simultaneously.|$|R

3000|$|..., {{to solve}} the problem of CP {{decomposition}} of semi-nonnegative semi-symmetric three-way arrays. Firstly, we rewrite the constrained optimization problem as an unconstrained one. In fact, the nonnegativity constraint of the two symmetric modes is ensured by means of a square change of variable. Secondly, a Jacobi-like optimization procedure is adopted because of its good convergence property. More precisely, the two new methods use LU and QR matrix factorizations, respectively, which consist in formulating high-dimensional optimization problems into several sequential polynomial and rational subproblems. By using both LU and QR matrix factorizations, we aim at studying the influence of the used matrix factorization. Numerical experiments on simulated arrays emphasize the advantages of the proposed methods especially the one based on LU factorization, in the presence of high-variance model error and of degeneracies such as bottlenecks. A <b>BSS</b> <b>application</b> on MRS data confirms the validity and improvement of the proposed methods.|$|R

40|$|The {{polynomial}} matrix EVD (PEVD) is {{an extension}} of the conventional eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) to polynomial matrices. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide a review of the theoretical foundations of the PEVD and to highlight practical applications in the area of broadband blind source separation (BSS). Based on basic definitions of polynomial matrix terminology such as parahermitian and paraunitary matrices, strong decorrelation and spectral majorization, the PEVD and its theoretical foundations will be briefly outlined. The paper then focuses on the applicability of the PEVD and broadband subspace techniques — enabled by the diagonalization and spectral majorization capabilities of PEVD algorithms—to define broadband BSS solutions that generalise well-known narrowband techniques based on the EVD. This is achieved through the analysis of new results from three exemplar broadband <b>BSS</b> <b>applications</b> — underwater acoustics, radar clutter suppression, and domain-weighted broadband beamforming — and their comparison with classical broadband methods...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{development}} of multi-channel sensors has motivated interest in devising new methods for the coherent processing of multivariate data. An extensive work {{has already been}} dedicated to multivariate data processing ranging from blind source separation (BSS) to multi/hyper-spectral data restoration. Previous work 1 has emphasized on the fundamental role played by sparsity and morphological diversity to enhance multichannel signal processing. GMCA is a recent algorithm for multichannel data analysis which was used successfully {{in a variety of}} applications including multichannel sparse decomposition, blind source separation (BSS), color image restoration and inpainting. Inspired by GMCA, a recently introduced algorithm coined HypGMCA is described for <b>BSS</b> <b>applications</b> in hyperspectral data processing. It assumes the collected data is a linear instantaneous mixture of components exhibiting sparse spectral signatures as well as sparse spatial morphologies, each in specified dictionaries of spectral and spatial waveforms. We report on numerical experiments with synthetic data and application to real observations which demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. ...|$|R

Among these are speech recognition rates, plots of separated signals, plots of cascaded mixing/unmixing impulse responses and signal to noise ratios.
