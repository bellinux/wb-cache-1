2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, <b>benzyl</b> <b>benzoate,</b> phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime.

The protected cyclohexanol substrates were efficiently and selectively hydroxylated by the mutant enzyme at the trans C–H bond of C- 4 on the cyclohexyl ring. The selectivity of oxidation of the benzoate ester protected cyclohexanol could be altered by making alternative amino acid substitutions in the P 450 cam active site. The addition of the double bond in the cyclohexyl ring of the benzoate ester protected cyclohex- 2 -enol has a debilitative effect on the activity of the Tyr 96 Ala mutant with this substrate. However, the Phe 87 Ala/Tyr 96 Phe double mutant, which introduces space at a different location in the active site than the Tyr 96 Ala mutant, was able to efficiently hydroxylate the C–H bonds of 1 -cyclohex- 2 -enyl benzoate at the allylic C- 4 position.

Other benzylic compounds contributing to the flavour were <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, methyl <b>benzoate</b> and 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde. When reconstituting the commercially available dried mushrooms, almond flavour develops, presumably by enzymic conversion of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol. Since benzoic acid is present at concentrations of 1280 - 3100 mg/kg dry weight, it may contribute to the excellent shelf life of the mushroom. Interestingly, benzoic acid also occurs in several close relatives of A. blazei, suggesting that this compound could well be a taxonomic marker. Among the non-volatile taste compounds, mannitol predominated to the extent of 22 % on dry weight. Contents of taste-enhancing free glutamic and aspartic acids were comparable to those reported in the White button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). The mycelium of A. blazei was found to be poor in nearly all compounds investigated.

In an effort to identify and characterize the organisms mediating halocarbon biodegradation, we surveyed the effect of potential cometabolic substrates on CH 3 Br biodegradation using a 13 CH 3 Br incubation technique. Toluene (160 to 200 nM) clearly inhibited CH 3 Br and CH 3 Cl degradation in seawater samples from the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Furthermore, a marine bacterium able to co-oxidize CH 3 Br while growing on toluene was isolated from subtropical Western Atlantic seawater. The bacterium, Oxy 6, was also able to oxidize o-xylene and the xylene monooxygenase (XMO) pathway intermediate 3 -methylcatechol. Patterns of substrate oxidation, lack of acetylene inhibition, and the inability of the toluene 4 -monooxygenase (T 4 MO) -containing bacterium Pseudomonas mendocina KR 1 to degrade CH 3 Br ruled out participation of the T 4 MO pathway in Oxy 6. Oxy 6 also oxidized a variety of toluene (TOL) pathway intermediates such as <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, benzylaldehyde, <b>benzoate,</b> and catechol, but the inability of Pseudomonas putida mt- 2 to degrade CH 3 Br suggested that the TOL pathway might not be responsible for CH 3 Br biodegradation. Molecular phylogenetic analysis identified Oxy 6 to be a member of the family Sphingomonadaceae related to species within the Porphyrobacter genus. Although some Sphingomonadaceae can degrade a variety of xenobiotic compounds, this appears to be the first report of CH 3 Br degradation for this class of organism.

Growth on fumarate as the sole carbon source with added benzyl alcohol or benzaldehyde selected spontaneous mutants of ISA 25. After repair of the cat deletion by natural transformation with linearized plasmid pPAN 4 (catBCIJF) 10 mutants were unable to grow on benzoate of cis,cis-muconate but could still grow on anthranilate. Transformation with wild-type chromosomal DNA demonstrated the presence of two unlinked mutations in each strain, one in the benABCD region, encoding the conversion of benzoate to catechol, and the other in a gene determining the ability to grow on exogenous cis,cis-muconate. The wild-type gene, named mucK, was cloned into pUC 18, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. It encodes a 413 -residue protein of M(r) = 45, 252 which is a member of a superfamily of membrane transport proteins and which is within a subgroup involved in the uptake of organic acids. Five of the mutant alleles were cloned, and the mutations were determined by nucleotide sequencing. All the mutations were in the mucK coding region and consisted of three deletions, one duplication, and a substitution. Insertional inactivation of mucK resulted in the loss of the ability to utilize exogenous muconate. The location of mucK on the chromosome appeared to be unique for genes associated with the benzoate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway in being close to the pca-qui-pob gene cluster (for p-hydroxybenzoate utilization) and distant from the functionally related ben-cat cluster.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} metabolic {{interactions and}} the importance of specific structural relationships in a benzyl alcohol-degrading microbial consortium comprising two species, Pseudomonas putida strain R 1 and Acinetobacter strain C 6, both of which are able to utilize benzyl alcohol as their sole carbon and energy source. The organisms were grown either as surface-attached organisms (biofilms) in flow chambers or as suspended cultures in chemostats. The numbers of CFU of P. putida R 1 and Acinetobacter strain C 6 were determined in chemostats and from the effluents of the flow chambers. When the two species were grown together in chemostats with limiting concentrations of benzyl alcohol, Acinetobacter strain C 6 outnumbered P. putida R 1 (500 : 1), whereas under similar growth conditions in biofilms, P. putida R 1 was present in higher numbers than Acinetobacter strain C 6 (5 : 1). In order to explain this difference, investigations of microbial activities and structural relationships were carried out in the biofilms. Insertion into P. putida R 1 of a fusion between the growth rate-regulated rRNA promoter rrnBP 1 and a gfp gene encoding an unstable variant of the green fluorescent protein made it possible to monitor the physiological activity of P. putida R 1 cells at different positions in the biofilms. Combining this with fluorescent in situ hybridization and scanning confocal laser microscopy showed that the two organisms compete or display commensal interactions depending on their relative physical positioning in the biofilm. In the initial phase of biofilm development, the growth activity of P. putida R 1 was shown to be higher near microcolonies of Acinetobacter strain C 6. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed that in the effluent of the Acinetobacter strain C 6 monoculture biofilm the metabolic intermediate benzoate accumulated, whereas in the biculture biofilms this was not the case, suggesting that in these biofilms the excess benzoate produced by Acinetobacter strain C 6 leaks into the surrounding environment, from where it is metabolized by P. putida R 1. After a few days, Acinetobacter strain C 6 colonies were overgrown by P. putida R 1 cells and new structures developed, in which microcolonies of Acinetobacter strain C 6 cells were established in the upper layer of the biofilm. In this way the two organisms developed structural relationships allowing Acinetobacter strain C 6 to be close to the bulk liquid with high concentrations of benzyl alcohol and allowing P. putida R 1 to benefit from the benzoate leaking from Acinetobacter strain C 6. We conclude that in chemostats, where the organisms cannot establish in fixed positions, the two strains will compete for the primary carbon source, benzyl alcohol, which apparently gives Acinetobacter strain C 6 a growth advantage, probably because it converts <b>benzyl</b> alcohol to <b>benzoate</b> with a higher yield per time unit than P. putida R 1.

Fungi with the capacity of using toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated by enriching environmental polluted soil and groundwater samples in solid state-like batches, air biofilters, and liquid cultures. Incubation conditions in the latter combined acidic pH and low water activity. The isolates were identified as Cladophialophora sp. (two strains), Exophiala sp., Leptodontium sp. and Pseudeurotium zonatum. The previously isolated toluene-growing fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum was also included in the present study. The genera Cladophialophora, Exophiala (both anamorphs of Capronia), and Cladosporium are classified into the black yeast-like and allied fungi. Members in this group are characterized for being cosmopolitan saprobes and opportunistic human pathogens. Growth curves showed that fungi grew on toluene with biomass doubling times of about 2 to 3 days. Some of the strains also grew on ethylbenzene and styrene. Kinetics of toluene degradation by cell suspensions followed the Michaelis-Menten model. Depending upon strain, the apparent KmSIZE= 2 >for toluene oxidation ranged from 5 to 22 μM. The toxicity of toluene, measured as the IC 50 value, ranged from 2. 4 to 4. 7 mM. The metabolic pathway for the oxidation of toluene was studied in a variety of fungi by using fluorinated toluene analogSIZE= 2 >ues and by determining the formed metabolites by 19 F NMR. Oxidation was similar in all toluene-assimilating fungi in which the initial conversion took place at the alkyl group. Toluene was initially oxidized to <b>benzyl</b> alcohol and <b>benzoate,</b> which was further hydroxylated at the ring first to 4 -hydroxy-benzoate, and then to catecholic compounds. The latter served as substrates for the opening of the ring and further metabolism through the 3 -oxoadipate pathway. The lack of significant benzene biodegradation by these fungi might be related with the incapacity of performing the ring hydroxylation. Oxidation of toluene at the aromatic ring was demonstrated for the zygomycete Cunninghamella echinulata. However, conversion rates here were very low in comparison with the assimilative metabolism and it occurred only co-metabolically. The substrates interactions during the degradation of BTEX mixtures were studied with the isolate Cladophialophora sp. strain T 1. This fungus grew on a model water-soluble fraction of gasoline that contained all six BTEX components. Benzene was not metabolized but the alkylated benzenes (TEX) were degraded by a combination of assimilation and co-metabolism. Toluene and ethylbenzene were used as sources of carbon and energy whereas ortho - and meta -xylene were co-metabolized to phthalates as end-metabolites. Para- xylene was not degraded in complex BTEX mixtures but, in combination with toluene, it appeared to be mineralized. The metabolic profiles and the inhibitory nature of the substrate interactions indicated that TEX were degraded at the side-chain by the same monooxygenase enzyme. The growth of the strain T 1 was also studied in sterile and non-sterile soil microcosms contaminated with a mixture of BTEX and MTBE. Inoculation with the fungus increased the degradation rates in soil after long exposure to BTEX and a low soil pH. Comparison of the biodegradation rates measured in presence and absence of indigenous bacteria, and the fungal inoculum suggested that the main interaction between indigenous and inoculated BTEX-degrading microorganisms was commensalistic. Alkylbenzenes were all degraded by the fungus, but benzene degradation required the activity of the indigenous soil microflora. MTBE could not be biodegraded. The presence and identity of the fungal inoculum in soil was confirmed {{at the end of the}} experiments by PCR-TGGE analysis of SSU of fungal 18 S rDNA. Fungi utilizing aromatic hydrocarbons can advantageously be used for biodegradation of BTEX in air biofilters and in soil. Fungal biodegradation is similar in kinetic terms to that of bacteria and posses a higher tolerance to adverse environments. However, factors limiting the application of fungi concern the lack of benzene degradation and the potential pathogenicity to humans...|$|R
50|$|Other {{treatments}} include lindane, <b>benzyl</b> <b>benzoate,</b> crotamiton, malathion, and sulfur preparations. Lindane is effective, but {{concerns over}} potential neurotoxicity have limited its availability in many countries. It is banned in California, {{but may be}} used in other states as a second-line treatment. Sulfur ointments or <b>benzyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> are often used in the developing world due to their low cost; Some 10% sulfur solutions {{have been shown to be}} effective, and sulfur ointments are typically used for at least a week, though many people find the odor of sulfur products unpleasant. Crotamiton has been found to be less effective than permethrin in limited studies. Crotamiton or sulfur preparations are sometimes recommended instead of permethrin for children, due to concerns over dermal absorption of permethrin.|$|E
