5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle.</b> The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{rebounding}} of <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies {{depends on}} private intervention. Population monitoring involves meticulous land surveys over vast countrysides. In addition to surveying land visually, remote sensing {{has been used}} to biologically classify a wetland as either suitable or unsuitable for a <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colony. This allows for comparisons to be made between known areas of <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> success and potential areas of future habitation.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{variations}} in mitochondrial DNA indicate {{low levels of}} genetic divergence among <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies. This is unusual in species such as the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle,</b> which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a population bottleneck – as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as the bog turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> between colonies facilitates genetic diversity. If this movement {{were to be}} prevented, or limited in any significant way, the species would have a higher likelihood of becoming extinct because genetic diversity would fall. Some aspects of a <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> movement that remain unresolved include: phenomena that motivate <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> to move outside their natural habitat; the distances an individual {{can be expected to}} travel each day, week, and year; and how separation of small groups affects the genetics of the species.|$|R

5|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle.</b> It and the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> spends {{its life}} almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years. The age of a <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is determined by {{counting the number of}} rings in a scute, minus the first one (which develops before birth).|$|E
5|$|The turtle {{has a low}} {{reproduction}} rate; females lay one clutch per year, with {{an average}} of three eggs each. The young tend to grow rapidly, reaching sexual maturity between the ages of 4 and 10years old. <b>Bog</b> <b>turtles</b> live for an average of 20to 30years in the wild. Since 1973, the Bronx Zoo has successfully bred <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> in captivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{reptiles}} {{are represented}} by <b>bog</b> <b>turtles,</b> common water snakes, rat snakes and sand lizard. <b>Bog</b> <b>turtles</b> are found in all waters. Common water snakes live {{on the banks of}} canals. Rat snakes and sand lizards are few and inhabit relatively high areas of land. Two more reptiles, Caspian whipsnake and Coluber spinalis, are extremely rare. Among amphibians common are lake frog and green frog.|$|R

5|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is native only to {{the eastern}} United States, congregating in colonies that often consist of fewer than 20individuals. They prefer {{calcareous}} wetlands (areas containing lime), including meadows, bogs, marshes, and spring seeps, that have both wet and dry regions. Their habitat is often {{on the edge of}} woods. Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> {{was noted}} in the 18th century by Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, a self-taught {{botanist}} and clergyman. Muhlenberg, who named more than 150North American plant species, was conducting {{a survey of the}} flora of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, when he discovered the small turtle. In 1801, Johann David Schoepff named Muhlenberg's discovery as Testudo muhlenbergii in Muhlenberg's honor.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E
50|$|The spotted turtle's range {{overlaps}} that of {{many other}} turtles. It can often {{be found in the}} same wetlands as wood <b>turtles,</b> <b>bog</b> <b>turtles,</b> snapping turtles, painted turtles, Blanding's turtles, eastern box turtles, common musk turtles, and eastern mud turtles.|$|R
40|$|The rich {{diversity}} of the world’s reptiles is at risk due to significant population declines of broad taxonomic and geographic scope. Significant factors attributed to these declines in-clude habitat loss, pollution, unsustainable collection and infectious disease. To investigate the presence and significance of a potential pathogen on populations of critically endan-gered <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) as well sympatric endangered wood (G. insculpta) and endangered spotted (Clemmys guttata) turtles in the northeastern United States, choanal and cloacal swabs collected from 230 turtles from 19 sites in 5 states were screened for herpesvirus by polymerase chain reaction. We found {{a high incidence of}} her-pesvirus infection in <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> (51. 5 %; 105 / 204) and smaller numbers of positive wood (5) and spotted (1) turtles. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed three previously uncharacterized alphaherpesviruses. Glyptemys herpesvirus 1 was the predominant her-pesvirus detected and was found exclusively in <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> in all states sampled. Glyptemys herpesvirus 2 was found only in wood turtles. Emydid herpesvirus 2 was found in a small number of <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> and a single spotted turtle from one state. Based on these findings...|$|R

5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle.</b> In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Richard Harlan {{renamed the}} turtle Emys muhlenbergii. The species was {{subsequently}} renamed to Calemys muhlenbergii by Louis Agassiz in 1857, and to Clemmys muhlenbergii by Henry Watson Fowler in 1906. Synonyms include Emys biguttata, named in 1824 by Thomas Say {{on the basis}} of a turtle from the vicinity of Philadelphia, and Clemmys nuchalis, described by Dunn in 1917 from near Linville, North Carolina. Today, there are various names for the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle,</b> including mud turtle, marsh turtle, yellowhead, and snapper.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bog</b> <b>turtles</b> {{may suffer}} from {{bacterial}} infections. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas are two genera of bacteria that cause pneumonia in individuals. Bacterial aggregates (sometimes known as biofilms) {{have also been}} found in the lungs of two deceased specimens discovered in 1982 and 1995 from colonies in the southern population.|$|R
5|$|The {{study of}} <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> {{in the wild}} is a {{significant}} aid {{to the development of}} a conservation strategy. Radio telemetry has been used to track the turtles' movements in their natural habitat. Blood samples, fecal samples, and cloacal swabs are also commonly collected from wild populations and tested for signs of disease.|$|R
5|$|Methods used to {{recreate}} the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> habitat include: controlled burns to limit the growth of overshadowing trees and underbrush (thus bringing the habitat back to early successional); grazing livestock such as cows and goats in the desired habitat area (creating pockets of water and freshly churned mud); and promoting beaver activity, including dam construction in and around wetlands.|$|R
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
500|$|Baby <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are about}} [...] long when they emerge from their eggs, usually in late August or September. Females are {{slightly}} smaller at birth, {{and tend to}} grow more slowly than males. Both genders grow rapidly until they reach maturity. Juveniles almost double in size in their first four years, but do not become fully grown until {{five or six years}} old.|$|R
5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.|$|R
50|$|Rivers {{and lakes}} of Moscow Oblast {{are rich in}} fish, such as ruff, carp, bream, bass, roaches, Chinese sleeper, perch and pike. There are six species of reptiles: three lizards (slowworm, {{viviparous}} lizard and sand lizard) and three snakes (European adder, grass snake and smooth snake). There is evidence for <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> in some areas. Amphibians are represented by 11 species including smooth newt, great crested newt, common toad, European green toad, common frog, moor frog, marsh frog, common spadefoot and European fire-bellied toad. Insects are numerous, with bees alone accounting for more than 300 species.|$|R
5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that the bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over the bypass and the highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} the bypass opened, without connections to the under-construction bypass, in April and May 2009, respectively. The roundabout at the northern end of the bypass opened when the bypass opened to traffic on August 6, 2009. To minimize disruption to the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat, MDSHA installed tunnels under the bypass for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the bypass rather than remove them with mechanical mowers. Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the bypass opened.|$|E

500|$|The {{northern}} and southern <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> populations are separated by a [...] gap over much of Virginia, which lacks <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies. In both areas, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies tend to occupy widely scattered ranges.|$|E
50|$|This {{region is}} home to a variety of wildlife, {{including}} black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces laces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), porcupine (Erithyzon dorsatum), river otter (Lontra canadensis), fisher (Martes pennant), beaver (Castor canadensis), marten (Martes americana), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), and raccoon (Procyon lot or). The forests are habitat for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), wood duck (Aix sponsa), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), and a great number of passerine birds. The area is particularly important as a feeding ground for birds migrating on the Atlantic Flyway. The peatland of western Massachusetts are home to <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> (Glyptemys muhlenbergii). Former species of fauna that roamed this region were the gray wolf, the eastern cougar, and the eastern elk, all three of which were wiped out from the region after the arrival of European settlers.|$|R
