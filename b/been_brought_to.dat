5|$|In the 1770s and 1780s the {{discovery}} of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by opencast mining led to a crash in the copper price, and expensive deep mining began to become unviable. As the copper boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through the large quantities of ore which had already <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the surface.|$|E

5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett Pacer, while in 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E

5|$|On 10 December 1942, Himmler {{issued an}} order to send all Sinti and Roma (Gypsies) to {{concentration}} camps, including Auschwitz. A separate camp for Roma was set up at Auschwitz II-Birkenau known as the Zigeunerfamilienlager (Gypsy Family Camp). The first transport of German Gypsies arrived on 26 February 1943, and was housed in Section B-IIe of Auschwitz II. Approximately 23,000 Gypsies had <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Auschwitz by 1944, 20,000 of whom died there. One transport of 1,700 Polish Sinti and Roma {{were killed in the}} gas chambers upon arrival, as they were suspected to be ill with spotted fever.|$|E
5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan {{horse in}} Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because of the close {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate {{ordnance}} establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August, 1862. Looking {{around for}} a suitable person to head this activity, General Hindman turned to the Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington. Lt. Dunnington was {{the commander of the}} gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain, which had <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad. Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock, and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department, he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities (which included artillery functions) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|The War Office and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, General Sir Bernard Paget, were {{won over}} by Browning's arguments, {{and agreed to}} detach the 1st Parachute Brigade, now under Brigadier Edwin Flavell, from 1st Airborne Division and place it {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General Dwight D.

He notes that the most deprived Zoroastrians had <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Isfahan, and {{had been forced to}} become Muslim three years earlier.

5|$|The city's {{accounts}} {{show the}} details of the payments for the construction of the tower between 1398 and 1399, including charges for 36,850 bricks, stone, sand, lime, a hoist and various equipment. At least 170 cartloads of stone are mentioned, and the bricks may have <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the site along the river by boat, while some of the timber was brought from Great Yarmouth. The total cost of the building from these records, including labour, came to around £36. The number of bricks used in the tower, however, was probably twice the listed number purchased, and the city may therefore already have stockpiled some bricks on the location before the build.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years.

Although most of the monastery grounds were secularized {{in the late eighteenth}} century, as many as 240 monks resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Yakiv Yatsynevych, either studied or taught at the school.|$|E
