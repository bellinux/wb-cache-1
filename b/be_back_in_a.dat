2500|$|In 1940, President Roosevelt {{instituted a}} one-year peacetime draft. Early in 1941, the Coast to Coast Music Corporation {{published}} a song by Mack Kay, [...] "Goodbye Dear, I'll <b>Be</b> <b>Back</b> <b>In</b> <b>A</b> Year," [...] ("cause I'm in the Army now"). The song rapidly rose on the charts, its popularity enhanced by a [...] "soundie," [...] a film short featuring the Landt Trio. However, in August 1941, the draft was extended, causing a widespread protest among the twelve-month draftees. Floods of sheet music were returned, and the soundie became a sad reminder of more optimistic days.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1951, she was fed up; two marriages had failed, and she was typecast in Hollywood as a sex symbol. As {{a result of her}} disillusionment with Hollywood and not liking what it did with people, she walked out on Hollywood, took her three children, and headed to New York to restart her career. Lake wanted to leave her sexy image behind, and New York offered the {{opportunity}} to work in theater and the new medium, television."They said, 'She'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> couple of months'", recalled Lake. [...] "Well I never returned. Enough was enough already. Did I want {{to be one of the}} walking dead or a real person?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Ann Bowles and Mrs. Clara Phelps are Mildred's {{friends and}} {{representative}} of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things {{in their lives and}} have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married, single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads Dover Beach to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading [...] "silly awful hurting words".|$|E

2500|$|Another account {{represents}} Lamon as {{traveling with}} the full confidence of Lincoln: [...] "It called for courage and the trip was made over the objection of Secretary Seward. 'Mr. Secretary,' said Lincoln, 'I have known to be in many a close place and he's never been in one he didn't get out of. [...] By Jing. [...] I'll risk it. [...] Go, Lamon, and God bless you.'" [...] Yet another account characterizes Lamon as being under Seward's influence and angering Lincoln: [...] "It was under Seward's influence that he actually told Governor Pickens {{that he had come}} to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison, and that after his return he wrote the governor that he would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few days to assist with the evacuation. [...] He also gave Major Anderson the impression that no relief would be attempted. [...] All this was outrageous, and when Lincoln heard of Lamon's letter to Pickens, he indignantly denied that the man possessed any authority to make such a statement." [...] Missions to Fort Sumter aside, the marshal's position was not an onerous one and afforded Lamon legitimate access to the President. [...] What Lamon took upon himself, however, was to represent himself as Lincoln's bodyguard, which he did out of friendship rather than the requirements of the position.|$|E
