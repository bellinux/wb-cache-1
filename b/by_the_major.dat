5|$|In the French-speaking {{world in}} his lifetime, Lamarck and his {{theories}} were rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> zoologists of the day, including Cuvier. However, he made {{more of an}} impact outside France and after his death, where leading scientists such as Ernst Haeckel, Charles Lyell and Darwin himself recognised him as a major zoologist, with theories that presaged Darwinian evolution.|$|E
5|$|Lamarck {{was largely}} ignored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> French {{zoologist}} Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck {{as an important}} zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E
5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E

5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball is {{a sports}} video game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is notable for {{being one of}} the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Major</b> League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although it was able to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups.|$|E

The New York Amsterdam News, based in Harlem, {{is one of the}} leading African American weekly newspapers in the United States. The Village Voice, historically the largest alternative newspaper in the United States, announced in 2017 that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thousands}} of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes, and the survival rate of works <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, {{but there are}} still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Commission, the chief {{accountant}} of the Ministry of Finance, A. van Gijn, objected to the report's conclusions. He provided a note to Queen Wilhelmina, which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced {{their views on the}} other members of the commission. Moreover, he believed that the proposed fleet would be inadequate given the rapid naval expansion being undertaken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> powers, and that if it was adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace. This note was included as an appendix to the Commission's report.|$|E
5|$|Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in {{his absence}} the papal envoy Maurice Bourdin, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at St. Peter's Basilica, {{probably}} that Easter and certainly by Pentecost. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim {{the title of the}} Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear. As a result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> magnates, {{and then by the}} more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition {{with the publication}} of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum (1637), published in Amsterdam by Arthur Johnston (c.1579–1641) and Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet (1585–1670) and containing work <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> Scottish practitioners since Buchanan. This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets. Elizabeth Melville's (f. 1585–1630) Ane Godlie Dream (1603) was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland. Anna Hume, daughter of David Hume of Godscroft, adapted Petrarch as Triumphs of Love: Chastitie: Death (1644).|$|E
5|$|Ideas for a Conan film were {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1970; Pressman and associate producer Edward Summer began {{a concerted effort to}} get the film made in 1975. It took them two years to obtain the film rights, after which they recruited Schwarzenegger for the lead role and Oliver Stone to draft a script. Pressman lacked capital for the endeavor, and in 1979, after having his proposals for investments rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> studios, he sold the project to Dino De Laurentiis. Milius was appointed as director and he rewrote Stone's script. The final screenplay integrated scenes from Howard's stories and from films such as Kwaidan and Seven Samurai. Filming took place in Spain over five months in the regions around Madrid and Almería. The sets, designed by Ron Cobb, were based on Dark Age cultures and Frank Frazetta's paintings of Conan. Milius eschewed optical effects, preferring to realize his ideas with mechanical constructs and optical illusions. Schwarzenegger performed most of his own stunts, and two types of swords, costing $10,000 each, were forged for his character. The editing process took over a year and several violent scenes were cut.|$|E
