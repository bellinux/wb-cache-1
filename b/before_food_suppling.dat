25|$|There are {{two primary}} sources of signals that stop eating: {{short-term}} signals come from immediate effects of eating a meal, beginning <b>before</b> <b>food</b> digestion, and long-term signals, {{that arise in}} adipose tissue, control the intake of calories by monitoring the sensitivity of brain mechanisms to hunger and satiety signals received.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Enteric {{diseases}} are often caused by poor hygiene and {{can contribute to}} stunting. From 50 randomly selected villages in Bangladesh, we collected quantitative and qualitative data on handwashing linked to child feeding to integrate handwashing promotion into a young child complementary feeding program. Most participants stated that the community knew the importance of handwashing with soap <b>before</b> <b>food</b> preparation and feeding a child, but had not developed the habit. We observed no handwashing with soap at these key times; sometimes hands were rinsed with water only. Most participants cited the unavailability of soap and water near the cooking place {{as a barrier to}} handwashing <b>before</b> <b>food</b> preparation. Most caregivers ranked nurturing messages as the best motivator to encourage handwashing with soap. An integrated intervention should include having soap and water available near the food preparation area and should use nurturing themes to encourage habitual handwashing with soap...|$|R
50|$|Simple {{precautions}} can {{be taken}} to prevent getting shigellosis: wash hands <b>before</b> handling <b>food</b> and thoroughly cook all <b>food</b> <b>before</b> eating. The primary prevention methods are improved sanitation and personal and food hygiene, but a low-cost and efficacious vaccine would complement these methods.|$|R
40|$|Indiana Food Processing The {{purpose of}} {{food-processing}} regulations {{is to maintain}} a safe and wholesome food supply. These regulations can be confusing because several governmental agencies could be involved. The type of food, how it is prepared or produced, {{and where it is}} to be sold will determine which regulatory agency or agencies are involved. It is best to consult knowledgeable sources before investing in a food-processing venture. Regulatory agencies require notification and inspection <b>before</b> <b>food</b> production can commence. It is necessary to know and understand which <b>food</b> regulations apply <b>before</b> starting a <b>food</b> business...|$|R

50|$|Improved {{facilities}} for feces disposal have decreased {{the incidence of}} whipworm. Handwashing <b>before</b> <b>food</b> handling, and avoiding ingestion of soil by thorough washing of food {{that may have been}} contaminated with egg-containing soil are other preventive measures. Improvement of sanitation systems, as well as improved {{facilities for}} feces disposal, have helped to limit defecation onto soil and contain potentially infectious feces from bodily contact.|$|R
25|$|Cotton and {{groundnuts}} {{are two of}} Chad's {{four major}} cash crops. Mali's major cash crops are peanuts and cotton. Mali's cotton production has grown from 500,000 tonnes in 1997 to a record 635,000 tonnes in 2003, which has pleased the African Association of Cotton Producers, but has also led to a claim that cash crops are being put <b>before</b> <b>food</b> and fodder crops in Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.|$|R
50|$|The {{digestive}} system {{can respond to}} external stimuli, such as the sight or smell of food, and cause physiological changes <b>before</b> the <b>food</b> ever enters the body. This reflex {{is known as the}} cephalic phase of digestion. The sight and smell of food are strong enough stimuli to cause salivation, gastric and pancreatic enzyme secretion, and endocrine secretion in preparation for the incoming nutrients; by starting the digestive process <b>before</b> <b>food</b> reaches the stomach, the body is able to more effectively and efficiently metabolize food into necessary nutrients. Once food hits the mouth, taste and information from receptors in the mouth add to the digestive response. Chemoreceptors and mechanorceptors, activated by chewing and swallowing, further increase the enzyme release in the stomach and intestine.|$|R

40|$|Pigeons {{were exposed}} to a {{procedure}} in which food was presented after a fixed period of time had elapsed, provided no attack against a nearby stuffed pigeon had occurred during the last 15 sec of the period. As the minimum inter-food interval was increased logarithmically through seven values from 15 sec to 960 sec, attack increased to a maximum and then decreased. For both pigeons, attack predominantly occurred after, rather than shortly <b>before,</b> <b>food</b> deliveries...|$|R
50|$|The cephalic {{phase is}} {{the stage in}} which the stomach {{responds}} to the mere sight, smell, taste, or thought of food. About 30% of total acid secretion occurs <b>before</b> <b>food</b> enters the stomach. These sensory and mental inputs converge on the hypothalamus, which relays signals to the medulla oblongata. Vagus nerve fibers from the medulla stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system of the stomach which, in turn, stimulates gastric secretion (via parietal and G cells).|$|R
40|$|A linear {{relationship}} between echo energy {{and amount of}} salmon dry food was established. Measurements were carried out both for food batches (5 - 400 gram) and single pellets. For {{a certain amount of}} food, the echo energy decreased when pellet size increased. The relationships allowed hydroacoustic detection of small amounts of food waste. Maximum food intake of a salmon population was determined as the amount of food delivered by the feeder <b>before</b> <b>food</b> waste was detected...|$|R

50|$|Condiments {{were known}} in Ancient Rome, Ancient India, Ancient Greece and Ancient China. There {{is a myth}} that <b>before</b> <b>food</b> {{preservation}} techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were {{used to make the}} food more palatable, but this claim is not supported by any evidence or historical record. The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen by , leading to a flourishing condiment industry.

It is concluded that moderate exercise taken <b>before</b> <b>food</b> does not interfere with transit time and therefore should not in that way interfere with nutrition...|$|R

50|$|Oxytetracycline, {{like other}} tetracyclines, {{is used to}} treat many infections, both common and rare (see Tetracycline {{antibiotics}} group). Its better absorption profile makes it preferable to tetracycline for moderately severe acne at a dosage of 250-500 mg {{four times a day}} for usually six to eight weeks at a time, but alternatives should be sought if no improvement occurs by three months. Avoid milk, iron, zinc or indigestion remedies while taking oxytetracycline. Take <b>before</b> <b>food</b> or on an empty stomach.
