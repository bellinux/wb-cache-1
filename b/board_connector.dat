50|$|Another {{connector}} extension {{was included}} for graphics cards. This extension {{was used for}} analog output from the video card, which was then routed through the system board to the system's own monitor output. The advantage of this was that Micro Channel system boards could have a basic VGA or MCGA graphics system on board, and higher level graphics (XGA or other accelerator cards) could then share the same port. The add-on cards were then able {{to be free of}} 'legacy' VGA modes, making use of the on-board graphics system when needed, and allowing a single system <b>board</b> <b>connector</b> for graphics that could be upgraded.|$|E
50|$|Three of the {{original}} PS2 launch models (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000, and SCPH-18000) were only sold in Japan, and lacked the expansion bay of later PS2 models. These models instead included a PCMCIA slot. SCPH-10000 and SCPH-15000 did not have built-in DVD movie playback and instead relied on encrypted playback software that was copied to a memory card from an included CD-ROM (normally, the PS2 will only execute encrypted software from its memory card; see PS2 Independence Exploit). V3 had a substantially different internal structure from the subsequent revisions, featuring several interconnected printed circuit boards. In V4 everything except the power supply was unified onto one board. V5 introduced minor internal changes, and {{the only difference between}} V6 (sometimes called V5.1) and V5 is the orientation of the Power/Reset switch <b>board</b> <b>connector,</b> which was reversed to prevent the use of no-solder modchips. V5 also introduced a more reliable laser than the ones used in previous models. V7 and V8 included only minor revisions to V6.|$|E

40|$|The Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon Time-Projection Chamber (NEXT) is {{intended}} to investigate the neutrinoless double beta decay of 136 Xe, which requires a severe suppression of potential backgrounds; therefore, an extensive screening and selection process is underway to control the radiopurity levels of the materials {{to be used in}} the experimental set-up of NEXT. The detector design combines the measurement of the topological signature of the event for background discrimination with the energy resolution optimization. Separate energy and tracking readout planes are based on different sensors: photomultiplier tubes for calorimetry and silicon multi-pixel photon counters for tracking. The design of a radiopure tracking plane, in direct contact with the gas detector medium, was specially challenging since the needed components like printed circuit <b>boards,</b> <b>connectors,</b> sensors or capacitors have typically, according to available information in databases and in the literature, activities too large for experiments requiring ultra-low background conditions.

40|$|The MuCell ® {{injection}} molding process is being applied by the world’s leading electronic connector manufacturers as a core plastics manufacturing technology to obtain (1) faster product development capability, (2) operating and capital cost savings and (3) productivity improvements. The MuCell {{injection molding}} process results in electronic connector components that have less residual stress, superior conformance to mold dimensions, and improved dimensional stability at extreme operating and soldering temperatures compared to conventionally molded parts.

40|$|A bus based {{parallel}} architectures is practical {{only for}} {{a small number of}} processors. For several thousand processors the bus would need to have a width of tens of thousands, or possibly a few hundred thousand wires (bits). Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} provide complete interconnectivity for highly parallel systems. For N = 10, 000, 100, 000, 000 channels would be required. Not only is the total number of channels unrealistic, but so is also the number of channels per node. One of the major constraints in system design is the packaging. The number of connections between a chip and a printed circuit (PC) board, or between a PC board and a backplane, or between backplanes, are limited by ensuring a sufficient mechanical strength of the connectors, enforcing a minimum width of each connector. Pin Grid Arrays (PGA) offer 200 – 400 pins per chip package, while current state-of-the art so-called Land Grid Arrays (LGA) offers up to 2, 000 connectors with spacings at about 1 mm, requiring an area of close to 2, 500 mm 2. <b>Board</b> <b>connectors</b> may offer about 2 – 3 pins per mm, or about 1, 000 for a standard PC board.
