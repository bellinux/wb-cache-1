50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the <b>bolster</b> <b>spring</b> seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The <b>bolster</b> <b>spring</b> sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|E
5000|$|The {{frame of}} the ICF bogie is a {{fabricated}} structure made up of mild steel. Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link brackets, <b>bolster</b> <b>spring</b> suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames. It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional bogie frame. Based on load carrying capacity per axle, the conventional bogie frames are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches. EMU Motor Coach type bogie frames, a different design of bogie frame is being used in all coaches of Electric Multiple Units (EMU) and all self-propelled coaches (motor coaches ...|$|E

This paper {{introduces}} {{the importance of}} the <b>bolster</b> <b>spring</b> in railroad traffic safety, and the present situation of detection about the free length of the <b>bolster</b> <b>spring</b> has been reviewed. For overcoming the shortcomings of the detection in accuracy and efficiency, a new method is proposed to detect and sort the free length of different specifications of bolster springs fast and high-precision,which based on laser scanning ranging principles and PC software programming. It will highly enhanced the detection precision and the accuracy of material selection. 1 Introduction <b>Bolster</b> <b>spring</b> of railroad track is an important interchangeable parts in railway trucks,which play a very important role in the truck's running process. In both sides of the railroad track bogies paired spring sets respectively, this spring sets were running under all load. The load balance of each spring sets will directly affect the working life of railway trucks and traffic safety[1, 2]. In the truck travel,one group of spring sets may carry a few tons to dozens tons of pressure. At this time, if the length of a group spring does not match, uneven stress may break springs or reduce their working life, and causing road traffic accidents. It not only requires that we must to measure and sort the qualified products, but also need an accurate management and classification of th...|$|E
50|$|The {{secondary}} suspension {{arrangement of the}} ICF bogies is through <b>bolster</b> <b>springs.</b> The bogie <b>bolster</b> is not bolted or welded anywhere to the bogie frame. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame through the anchor link. The anchor link is a tubular structure with cylindrical housing on both the ends. The cylindrical housings have silent blocks placed in them. The anchor link is fixed to the bogie bolster and the bogie frame with the help of steel brackets welded to the bogie bolster and the bogie frame. Both the ends of the anchor link act as a hinge and allow movement of the bogie bolster when the coach is moving on a curved track.|$|R
50|$|The bogies are {{improved}} {{versions of}} the SF500 bogie. Innovations include the body <b>bolster,</b> vibration damper, <b>spring</b> parameters, transmission ratio, widening the carbody and increasing {{the speed of the}} trainsets.|$|R
25|$|The bogies for the {{new cars}} were a new design, {{specifically}} prepared by Vicers Ruwolt. The suspension was based on coil springs, with a secondary cast <b>bolster</b> with <b>spring</b> plank, supported on swing links and coil springs. Each bogie weighed 7000kg, with a wheelbase of 2,445mm and a maximum axle load of 14 tonnes, and were designed for operation at up to 130km/h. Tread brakes were fitted, operated by Westinghouse model 250WF brake cylinders. The axle boxes utilised spherical roller bearings, and {{all parts of the}} bogie, except the wheels and axles themselves, were designed for conversion to standard gauge. This latter function was finally used in 2009 when the Mangalore to Albury line was converted to standard gauge.|$|R
50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the <b>bolster</b> and suspension <b>springs.</b> The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|R
50|$|The fixed bogies {{which are}} used by most 100% low floor trams {{increase}} track wear and decrease {{the speed at which}} a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4 - 15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The 15 T is designed to cope with these issues through Jacobs bogies under the articulations and pivoting bogies at the tram's ends. For a time it was said to be the only true 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies in production. However, the Alstom Citadis X04, an experimental 100% low floor tram currently being developed with pivoting bogies (but with sections of high floor seating over the bogies), has made an initial production appearance as a modified Citadis 301 (with a fixed centre bogie) in Istanbul, and for Helsinki, a tram with similar interior solution and all pivoting bogies is undergoing trials as of 2015. With the same length of tramcar, the Škoda 15 T has also four bogies compared to the predecessor Škoda 14 T's three (same on most other 100% low floor trams) (fixed) bogies, which decreases the load each wheel puts on the track. The most of the tram floor is at height of 350 mm above rail; the height over the bogies is 450 mm above rail; the transition is inclined, without interior steps. The corridor above the central bogies is 700 mm wide. The bogies may be all driven, or some of them may be idle ones, depending on the customer's preferences. The bogies have two axles and two-level springing. The mounted wheels are made of rubber-sprung wheels with integrated brake-discs and axle bearing. On the axle bearings there is a combined, dynamically resistant, primary rubber-bonded-metal-sprung bogie framework. This bogie framework supports four traction motors and one (in outer bogies) or two (in inner bogies) <b>sprung</b> swing <b>bolsters.</b> The secondary <b>springing</b> of the swing bolsters is secured by steel coil springs with parallel hydraulic rotating dampers. On the swing bolsters there are pivot bearings, which facilitate full rotation of the bogie below the body without any limitations.|$|R
