5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had <b>been</b> <b>fine</b> and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
25|$|The Oyo Empire, {{like many}} empires before it, used {{both local and}} {{tributary}} forces to expand its domains. The structure of the Oyo military prior to its imperial period was simple and closer aligned to the central government in metropolitan Oyo. This may have <b>been</b> <b>fine</b> in the 15th century when Oyo controlled only its heartland. But to make and maintain farther conquest, the structure underwent several changes.|$|E
25|$|The RealThiol (RT) probe is {{the second}} {{generation}} reversible reaction-based GSH probe developed by the Wang group. A few key features of RealThiol: 1) it has a much faster forward and backward reaction kinetics compared to ThiolQuant Green, which enables real time monitoring of GSH dynamics in live cells. 2) only micromolar to sub-micromolar RealThiol is needed for staining in cell based experiments, which induces minimal perturbation to GSH level in cells. 3) a high quantum yield coumarin fluorophore was implemented so that background noise can be minimized 4) equilibrium constant of the reaction between RealThiol and GSH has <b>been</b> <b>fine</b> tuned to respond to physiologically relevant concentration of GSH. RealThiol {{can be used to}} perform measurements of glutathione levels in single cells using a high resolution confocal microscope, as well as be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements in high throughput manner.|$|E

25|$|For a {{right-handed}} player, the forehand is {{a stroke}} that begins {{on the right}} side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the continental, the eastern, the semi-western, and the western. For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have <b>been</b> <b>fine</b> players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as Monica Seles or France's Fabrice Santoro and Marion Bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.|$|E
500|$|Andrea Graham {{wrote for}} Common Sense Media that revival series Double Dare 2000 is a [...] "fun, action-filled game show that {{families}} can watch together – {{amid all the}} slime are some good messages about family togetherness".

500|$|Others {{were more}} {{negative}} towards the episode. Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B", criticizing Paula Marshall's reappearance, declaring her a [...] "show killer."

[...] Reviewer Alan Sepinwall gave a mixed review, praising Logan and Wallace's interactions and Kristen Bell's performance, but criticizing {{the fact that}} the episode came so late in the season. [...] "Had this been the season's fourth or fifth episode, it would have <b>been</b> <b>fine.</b> As the fifth-to-last episode, it felt like exactly what it was: a belated correction for a season-long problem."

500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg so I think that was a problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have <b>been</b> <b>fine,</b> I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E
500|$|Although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, he criticized it for {{including}} seven new songs and just nine hits. According to him, {{if it had been a}} straight hits collection, with [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] and [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] added to the end, it would have <b>been</b> <b>fine,</b> but padding it with nearly a full album worth of new material hurts it. He also noticed that Dion's first American hit, [...] "Where Does My Heart Beat Now", isn't here, nor is her duet with Barbra Streisand, [...] "Tell Him". Erlewine stated that the best of the hits, like the Meat Loaf-ian epic [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] and [...] "My Heart Will Go On", are certainly among the best adult contemporary songs of the decade. In comparison to the new material, he felt that the danceable [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] and the [...] "pretty" [...] ballad [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] work, but he did not like [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" [...] and [...] "All the Way". According to him, the remaining three new songs [...] "aren't bad", but they're not particularly memorable, especially compared to the hits.|$|E
500|$|Both {{episodes of}} [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly described them as [...] "nearly perfect", calling them {{the two best}} episodes of the season so far: [...] " [...] nailed the characterizations, the interactions, the tossed-off one-liners, the weird-yet-realistic scenarios...I wonder how much it helps that she's out on the acting floor every day, getting attuned to her costars' rhythms?" [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the first [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] episode was his favorite episode of the fifth season so far, which he said provided several laugh-out-loud moments and a poignancy with Michael's decision to find Holly. McAuliffe described the second episode as a [...] "satisfying wrap-up" [...] and said Michael's outburst during the lecture was [...] "one of the most painful Michael meltdown moments in the show's history". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the first episode perfectly balanced drama and comedy. He particularly complimented the chemistry between both Carell and Fischer and between Krasinski and Wilson, {{and said he was}} particularly pleased to receive closure over the Karen character. But Sepinwall said the second episode felt padded with [...] "material I would have <b>been</b> <b>fine</b> seeing as deleted scenes". Although he said Carell's reaction to the news that Holly still has feelings for him as a [...] "wonderful performance", Sepinwall also said the subplot involving Angela's cat was particularly unfunny and that subplot with Jim and Dwight, [...] "so brilliant last week, ran out of steam quickly here." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2012, Laird {{signed for}} League One side Preston North End on a free transfer. The move reunited him with manager Graham Westley, who had {{previously}} managed Laird at Stevenage. He made his Preston debut in the club's {{first game of the}} 2012–13 season, playing the whole match in 2–0 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup. Laird scored his first goals for the club in a 5–0 win against Hartlepool United at Deepdale in September 2012, netting twice within the space of three second-half minutes. His third goal of the season came in a 3–1 away victory at Doncaster Rovers on 2 October 2012, heading in Joel Byrom's cross to restore Preston's lead in the match. He added to his goal tally a month later, [...] "acrobatically volleying in Chris Robertson's knockdown" [...] in a 1–1 home draw with Brentford. In the club's next match, a home game against Notts County on 20 November 2012, Laird suffered a broken leg following a challenge from Jamal Campbell-Ryce. It was later revealed that Laird had broken his left tibia and would miss the remainder of the season. During his recovery, Laird stated that Campbell-Ryce rang him on a weekly basis — [...] "I knew him previously and he's rung me every week to make sure I'm alright. I'm not one to hold grudges anyway and he's <b>been</b> <b>fine.</b> I accept his apology". Laird scored four times in 24 games during his first season with the club.|$|E
500|$|TV Squad writer Jay Black {{praised the}} main plot, and wrote, [...] "I was delighted that {{the trip to}} the Prince Family Paper Company became a test of Michael's morals rather than the usual {{exercise}} in his stupidity." [...] Black said Dwight's attempts to get Michael to give up the client list were among the best set of scenes for the season. However, Black said the Hilary Swank subplot suffered in comparison, and felt like a vain attempt to find something for the supporting cast to do. The A.V. Club writer Nathan Rabin was disappointed with [...] "Prince Family Paper", calling it overly dependent on throwaway gags and describing it as [...] "about as inconsequential as The Office gets". Rabin complimented the opening gag with Jim and Dwight, but said it [...] "felt like the kind of gag the show has pulled off dozens, if not hundreds of times, before". Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly said it was not one of the strongest Office episodes, and that the script took a particularly mean tone with the Prince Family Paper subplot. But Wheat said it included some enjoyable moments, like Jim's prank against Dwight in the opening scene. Will Leitch of New York magazine was very critical of the episode, especially the Hilary Swank subplot, which he said [...] "sounded like a conversation B. J. Novak had with himself at a party and submitted as a backup script". Leitch also pointed out the episode {{had nothing to do with}} the show's ongoing plotlines: [...] "It's the definition of filler. Which would have <b>been</b> <b>fine,</b> had it been funnier." [...] "Prince Family Paper" [...] was voted the lowest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally, where the episode was rated 6.98 out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Following the single's success, Girls Aloud {{proceeded}} to begin recording their debut album, which shares its title with the single. As the team grew, their music {{began to take}} over the nation. They reunited with Brian Higgins and Xenomania. Referring to [...] "No Good Advice", Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song – [...] "we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's <b>been</b> <b>fine.</b> They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1927, {{along with}} other {{prominent}} Pathé and Perfect vocal artists (Willard Robison, Annette Hanshaw, Cliff Edwards), Morse moved to the Columbia label. From 1927 to 1932, {{she was one of}} the label's most popular female performers, second only to Ruth Etting. Morse continued to do vaudeville and other stage work during this time, landing a role in Ziegfeld's Simple Simon that may have made her an even bigger star. Unfortunately, Morse's drinking problem left her unable to perform on the show's February 18, 1930 debut. According to Lorenz Hart biographer Gary Marmorstein: [...] ", Wynn, the bicycle-piano and Lee Morse made their entrance and were greeted with applause. Everything would have <b>been</b> <b>fine</b> except that Miss Morse had had a few too many and couldn't remember the words or the music." [...] Minus their star, the producers asked Ruth Etting to step up in the eleventh hour to fill Morse's shoes. As a result, the show's memorable [...] "Ten Cents a Dance" [...] became Etting's signature while Morse's once promising Broadway career abruptly ended.|$|E
