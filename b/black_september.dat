5|$|Shortly after <b>Black</b> <b>September,</b> Abu Nidal began {{accusing the}} PLO of cowardice over his Voice of Palestine {{radio station in}} Iraq for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, Abu Nidal joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and Abu Daoud (leader of the <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> Organization {{responsible}} for the 1972 Munich Massacre), calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein.|$|E
5|$|James Dixon <b>Black</b> (<b>September</b> 24, 1849 – August 5, 1938) was the 39th Governor of Kentucky, serving {{for seven}} months in 1919. He ascended to the office when Governor Augustus O. Stanley {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the three <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> members had arrived at Zagreb Airport, the hijacked Lufthansa jet also landed there and some time later, at 18:05, the handing-over took place. This {{happened}} without any reciprocal measures: The 18 hostages were not released yet.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Fatah {{began to}} engage in {{communal}} projects to achieve popular affiliation. The battle of Karameh and the subsequent increase in the PLO's strength are considered to have been important catalysts for the 1970 events {{of the civil war}} known as <b>Black</b> <b>September,</b> in which the kingdom managed to expel the Palestinian groups to Lebanon after they had started to gain control over Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened {{to blow up}} the aircraft using explosives that had been hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> were not released from the German prison.|$|E
5|$|For its actions, the West German {{government}} was criticised by Israel and other parties, {{in some cases}} combined with allegations that the hijacking had been staged or at least tolerated with theories of a secret agreement between the German government and <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> Organization - release of the surviving terrorists in exchange for assurances of no further attacks on Germany.|$|E

5|$|His partisans sought vengeance for his {{killing and}} a {{splinter}} group developed within Fatah consisting of {{men from the}} Tiger Cubs and other Fatah dissidents. It {{came to be known}} as the <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> Organization (BSO) and Abu Ali's men provided its initial membership. On November 28, one of his former Tiger Cubs, Munshir al-Khalifa, assassinated al-Tal in Cairo. According to Seale, this was the first attack carried out by the BSO.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1972, {{during the}} Munich Summer Olympics, eight fighters of the Palestinian group <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> took hostage eleven {{members of the}} Israeli Olympic team. Eventually, all hostages were killed, either in the initial assault or during a {{shoot-out}} following a failed police rescue attempt at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base. Three perpetrators (Adnan Al-Gashey, Jamal Al-Gashey, and Mohammed Safady) survived and were subsequently arrested and held in pre-trial custody.|$|E
5|$|Terrorism most {{directly}} affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games {{were held in}} Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> {{in what is now}} known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five terrorists also perished.|$|E

5|$|When the Lufthansa {{airplane}} {{was seized}} by sympathisers of <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> during the Beirut-Ankara part of a multi-stopover flight from Damascus to Frankfurt, the West German authorities complied with the demand of having the prisoners released. They were handed over at Zagreb Airport, and the hijacked aircraft was flown to Tripoli, where all hostages were released. The liberated Munich attackers were granted asylum by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} Khartoum, Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before <b>Black</b> <b>September,</b> when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out of Jordan, {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Al-Wazir {{became a}} refugee when {{his family was}} {{expelled}} from Ramla during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and began leading a minor fedayeen force in the Gaza Strip. In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with Communist regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah's first bureau in Algeria. He {{played an important role}} in the 1970–71 <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> clashes in Jordan, by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO's defeat by the Jordanian Army, al-Wazir joined the PLO in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|As a Fatah field commander, {{he fought}} Israeli forces at the Battle of Karameh, gaining a {{reputation}} as an unyielding commander. Abu Ali Iyad was also a leading organizer and participant in guerrilla raids against Israeli localities. He {{was one of the}} last Palestinian commanders to fight the Jordanian Army in the aftermath of the <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> conflict. He was killed in the countryside around Ajlun and Jerash by Jordanian forces in July 1971. His partisans claimed that he was executed, and as retaliation, they assassinated Jordanian prime minister Wasfi al-Tal four months after Abu Ali Iyad's death.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{fuel stop}} at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb {{in what was then}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Israel adopted {{targeted}} killing {{in response to}} <b>Black</b> <b>September's</b> Munich Olympics massacre, leading to Mossad's Operation Wrath of God and Sayeret Matkal's Operation Spring of Youth.

5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} 1972. The Fatah subgroup <b>Black</b> <b>September</b> hijacked Sabena Flight 572 {{en route to}} Vienna and forced it to land at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel. The PFLP and the Japanese Red Army carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport, killing twenty-four civilians. Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan Kanafani {{was a response to}} the PFLP's involvement in masterminding the latter attack. Two days later, various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station, killing eleven civilians.|$|E
