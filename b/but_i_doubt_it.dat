500|$|Fischer was {{a master}} of playing with, and against, the Sicilian Defense. The next most common defense against Fischer's 1.e4 was the Caro-Kann Defense (1.e4 c6), against which Fischer had a good record. Fischer's worst record was against the French Defense (1.e4 e6), {{especially}} the [...] (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4). Fischer maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, [...] "Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and...Bxc3." [...] Later on Fischer said: [...] "I may yet be forced {{to admit that the}} Winawer is sound. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it!</b> The defense is anti-positional and weakens the K-side." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Barkley {{wrote the}} {{foreword}} for Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly's book The Life of Reilly. In it, Barkley quipped, [...] "Of {{all the people}} in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys look real aerodynamic." [...] In 2002, Barkley released the book I May Be Wrong, <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doubt</b> <b>It,</b> which included editing and commentary by close friend Michael Wilbon. Three years later, Barkley released Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?, which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.|$|E

Well, this week's episode, titled 'Us,' was not exactly slow, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> will draw the crowds to the water cooler this morning either.

60|$|By {{evening we}} guessed {{that we had}} reached that border tract which was harried by the Mountain tribes, for here strong towers built of stone were dotted about the heaths, doubtless to serve as watch-houses or places of refuge. Whether they were garrisoned by {{soldiers}} I do not know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it,</b> for we saw none.

60|$|It made me sleepy, and I slept.
