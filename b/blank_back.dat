6000|$|... "Time," [...] replied Syme, [...] "for one {{outrageous}} thought. I {{was suddenly}} possessed {{with the idea}} that the blind, <b>blank</b> <b>back</b> of his head really was his face--an awful, eyeless face staring at me! And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards, and dancing as he ran." ...|$|E
60|$|Over {{the house}} itself, he {{exercised}} the same imaginary power as over its inhabitants and their affairs. He {{had never been}} in it, the length of a piece of fat black water-pipe which trailed itself over the area-door into a damp stone passage, and had rather the air of a leech on the house that had 'taken' wonderfully; but this was no impediment to his arranging it according to a plan of his own. It was a great dingy house with a quantity of dim side window and <b>blank</b> <b>back</b> premises, and it cost his mind a world of trouble so to lay it out as to account for everything in its external appearance. But, this once done, was quite satisfactory, and he rested persuaded, that he knew his way about the house blindfold: from the barred garrets in the high roof, to the two iron extinguishers before the main door--which seemed to request all lively visitors to have the kindness to put themselves out, before entering.|$|E
6000|$|After this {{coincidence}} of symbols I had a curious {{sense of having}} left France behind me, or, perhaps, even the civilised world. And, indeed, {{there was something in}} the landscape wild enough to encourage such a fancy. I have seen perhaps higher mountains, but I have never seen higher rocks; I have never seen height so near, so abrupt and sensational, splinters of rock that stood up like the spires of churches, cliffs that fell sudden and straight as Satan fell from heaven. There was also a quality in the ride which was not only astonishing, but rather bewildering; a quality which many must have noticed if they have driven or ridden rapidly up mountain roads. I mean a sense of gigantic gyration, as of the whole earth turning about one's head. It is quite inadequate to say that the hills rose and fell like enormous waves. Rather the hills seemed to turn about me like the enormous sails of a windmill, a vast wheel of monstrous archangelic wings. As we drove on and up into the gathering purple of the sunset this dizziness increased, confounding things above with things below. Wide walls of wooded rock stood out above my head like a roof. I stared at them until I fancied that I was staring down at a wooded plain. Below me steeps of green swept down to the river. I stared at them until I fancied that they swept up to the sky. The purple darkened, night drew nearer; it seemed only to cut clearer the chasms and draw higher the spires of that nightmare landscape. Above me in the twilight was the huge black hulk of the driver, and his broad, <b>blank</b> <b>back</b> was as mysterious as the back of Death in Watts' picture. I felt that I was growing too fantastic, and I sought to speak of ordinary things. I called out to the driver in French, [...] "Where are you taking me?" [...] and it is a literal and solemn fact that he answered me in the same language without turning around, [...] "To the end of the world." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hammer of the Scots is a block wargame. The {{units are}} {{represented}} by wooden blocks with identifying markings on only one side. These blocks are stood up so that only the controlling player can see the identifiers, with the opposing player only seeing a <b>blank</b> <b>back.</b> This helps simulate the [...] "fog of war".|$|E
50|$|The redbacks {{were issued}} in the {{denominations}} of $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, and $500 bills. There were also “change notes” issued {{at the time}} of $1, $2, and $3 bills that had a <b>blank</b> <b>back.</b> All these notes were issued from Austin, Texas. Many of the notes appear as orange-colored because {{of the quality of the}} ink. Several people have suggested that the “burnt orange” color of The University of Texas at Austin came from this coloring, but it cannot be proven.|$|E
5000|$|The 50 player {{cards in}} the set are {{approximately}} 4" [...] × 5½", with a <b>blank</b> <b>back,</b> and feature a small black & white photo of the player, a facsimile autograph, and a few biographical details and stats. The only way to distinguish the cards between the two years is to compare the stats. There has been some confusion over the years about the 50 player {{cards in the}} 1964 set, and the 50 in the 1965 set. Some players are the same in both editions, and some are different.|$|E
50|$|Bowman Proofs were {{experimental}} cards of 12 {{players from}} the regular set. They were 45% larger (2½ × 3¾ in.) and had black-and-white and color variations with <b>blank</b> <b>backs.</b> Some of the differences with these cards involve picture cropping or uniform changes.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "1947 Red or Blue Borders" [...] round menko were 1+7/8 in in diameter, with cartoon-like {{players on}} the front and <b>blank</b> <b>backs.</b> The team name in English, an {{arithmetic}} addition or subtraction, and the player name and sometimes position in kanji were also on the front.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} color proofs known to exist for this set. The 1953 Bowman proofs {{are the same}} size as the {{regularly}} issued cards but with <b>blank</b> <b>backs.</b> The cards feature Enos Slaughter, Warren Spahn, 'Dodgers In Action,' and Ferris Fain. Also, Bowman issued as either box fillers or salesmen's samples sequential 3-card panels.|$|R
5000|$|The Reed of {{this reality}} is an {{intelligent}} ape given stretching powers {{by exposure to}} cosmic radiation, as in the mainstream Marvel universe. He tries {{to find a way}} to send Marty [...] "The Gibbon" [...] <b>Blank</b> <b>back</b> to his home reality. He is also one of the few that realizes Captain America is really a disguised Baron Blood. Reed is impaled and killed by Blood in an attempt to stop the vampire from trying to invade Earth-616 for a new source of blood. The rest of the Marvel Ape-verse heroes are led to believe Marty is responsible for Reed's death and pursue him until discovering the truth.|$|E
50|$|A player {{moving into}} an area {{containing}} a lead can choose to investigate that lead (which takes one Time unit). Investigating leads give players two options. The first is placing evidence on suspects. Evidence consists of tile; {{one side of the}} tile is a standard <b>blank</b> <b>back,</b> the other side is a number ranging from -4 to +5. A player draws a face-down tile then places this evidence upon one of the suspects face-down. The higher the number, the more guilty a suspect becomes; the lower the number, the more innocent. Additionally, there are evidence tiles that contain Surprise Witnesses (blue faces) which are equal to -5 and Perjury tiles (red faces) that eliminate the benefit of a Surprise Witness or Alibi and add +5. At the end of the game, the score on each suspect is added up via the evidence on their suspect sheet; the evidence tiles total determines guilt or innocence.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the next}} parade, Jones recounts how the British {{officers}} in the Sudan who had the [...] "Honourable" [...] title always had a stiff upper lip, even after their heads had been blown off. Mainwaring addresses the parade and insists that Wilson must do his motorcycle training on the platoon's motorbike. Then the platoon practise grounding arms and applauding, just as the Town Clerk arrives. In Mainwaring's office he suggests tentatively that [...] "the Honourable Arthur Wilson" [...] should present {{the key to the}} Russian instead of Mainwaring. Mainwaring refuses point <b>blank.</b> <b>Back</b> on parade, they are interrupted by the verger and the vicar, who invite Wilson to join the PCC, and also ask if he would like a crest for his own private pew. Mainwaring and Wilson retreat to his office, where Mainwaring again refuses to step aside for Wilson when telephoned by Hodges. Mainwaring finally snaps and reveals his intense jealousy over Wilson's newfound title; Wilson however admits he resents his new social status, as the people of Walmington-on-Sea continually pester him. This only infuriates Mainwaring more, as he fancies that one should prize aristocratic titles, and admits if he had a title he would make himself a director of the bank. He reminds Wilson that, title or not, he is still Mainwaring's employee and that he had better learn his place.|$|E
25|$|Sharp corners {{wear out}} more quickly, and could {{possibly}} reveal the card's value, {{so they were}} replaced with rounded corners. Before the mid-19th century, British, American, and French players preferred <b>blank</b> <b>backs.</b> The need to hide wear and tear and to discourage writing on the back led cards to have designs, pictures, photos, or advertising on the reverse.|$|R
50|$|The set {{introduced}} the Pirate, English, and Spanish factions, with ships for each faction {{ranging in size}} from one to five masts. Twelve named crew members, along with the generic crew of Captain, Helmsman, Musketeer, Shipwright, Oarsman, Cannoneer, and Explorer were also present for each faction. A number of generic treasure, in the form of gold pieces ranging in value from 1 to 7, as well as nine pieces of named unique treasure were included, along with an assortment of cardboard islands with <b>blank</b> <b>backs.</b>|$|R

60|$|Their journey now {{took them}} through bare brick ways like tunnels; streets with few lights {{and even with}} few windows; streets that seemed built out of the <b>blank</b> <b>backs</b> of {{everything}} and everywhere. Dusk was deepening, {{and it was not}} easy even for the London policemen to guess in what exact direction they were treading. The inspector, however, was pretty certain that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead Heath. Abruptly one bulging gas-lit window broke the blue twilight like a bull's-eye lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little garish sweetstuff shop. After an instant's hesitation he went in; he stood amid the gaudy colours of the confectionery with entire gravity and bought thirteen chocolate cigars with a certain care. He was clearly preparing an opening; but he did not need one.|$|R

50|$|Daines Barrington, {{described}} an Elizabethan card party painted by Federico Zuccari, and that originally belonged to Lord Falkland, in which Lord Burleigh is represented playing at cards {{with three other}} persons, apparently of distinction, each having two rings on the same fingers of both their hands. The cards used are marked as at present, although they {{differ from those of}} modern times for being narrower and longer. Eight of the cards lie on the table with the blank side uppermost, for the cards at that time had <b>blank</b> <b>backs,</b> while four remain in each of the other players hands. A particular in this painting {{is that one of the}} players is seen showing his cards, which are: the jack (knave) of hearts, the ace, 7 and 6 of clubs. The cover of the pack lying on the table displays two lions supporting a shield, upon which is what appears to be a heraldic rose (the crest of the Tudors), and underneath, though indistinctly, the partially illegible name of a French card-maker Jehan Licl**rer. This particular shows that the cards then used were at least sometimes obtained from France. The money on the table, together with considerable heaps of gold and silver, appears to be coins of Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I.|$|R
