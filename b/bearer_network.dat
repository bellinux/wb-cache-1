40|$|The modern {{approach}} to complex services has some shortcomings which overcomplicate {{the implementation of}} application servers supporting service logic and also the actual structure of these services. Modern service development environments rely heavily on <b>bearer</b> <b>network</b> call/session signalling for the transport of service messages to remote terminals and manipulating bearer streams in the network. This research report looks at the overheads which occur when the <b>bearer</b> <b>network</b> is used as the main transport for distributed service logic and {{then goes on to}} propose application layer focused service development as a replacement for this. Service logic developed in the application layer should be constrained to the application layer so as to avoid leaky abstractions and make service development more intuitive to programmers who do not have deep knowledge of telecommunications technologies since the details of the <b>bearer</b> <b>network</b> do not play a part in the application layer. Application layer signalling is introduced as a concept very important to keeping service logic in the application layer, by allowing service messages to bypass the <b>bearer</b> <b>network.</b> In this way, service sessions are started and maintained in the application layer and lower-layer functionality is only called on when <b>bearer</b> <b>network</b> streams are required by a service. A framework is developed to support application layer focused service development. This framework acts as support for decoupled service logic by allowing easy abstracted use of application layer signalling and <b>bearer</b> <b>network</b> functionality. It also provides a simpli ed means for managing service logic. Reusability is also built in in the form of reusable building blocks which abstract out various functionality including that of the <b>bearer</b> <b>network.</b> Using example services designed to be supported within the framework, the ideas of application layer focused service development are proved to simplify service development and o er robust support to services. Whilst this research report does not attempt to standardise the technologies used to constrain service logic in the application layer, it does put forward important concepts which, when implemented, would enhance service development environments by providing a strong platform on which to develop services...|$|E

In order to attract more customers to such mobile applications, a solid, secure and robust trading model is a must. This paper proposes such a secure trading model named Mobile Electronic Payment (MEP) for wireless mobile networks, which applies the emerging ID-based cryptography for key agreement and authentication. Our MEP attempts to alleviate the computational cost, reduce the memory space requirement in mobile devices, and meet the requirements for secure trading: avoidance of overspending and double spending, fairness, user anonymity and privacy.

Real measurement data from operating cellular networks indicates that the traffic models and scenarios disobey our traditional assumptions (i. e., expressing bursty nature). As a result, current network architectures and service management may cause experience deterioration of subscribers in future networks. In this article, we propose three approaches to alleviate the influence of various traffic bursts: baseband resource pool on a cloud platform as wireless infrastructure to enhance the capacity and flexibility of networks, cloud core networks to provide dynamic extension and service flow control abilities, and software-defined <b>bearer</b> <b>networks</b> to simplify service delivery instructed by core networks. Different from conventional stovepipe-like cloud computing network architectures, our proposed architecture interconnects and shares information between entities, breaking through horizontal device barriers and vertical layers. These cloud-based approaches not only avoid the potentially negative impact of bursts, but also provide a software-controlled end-to-end service management framework for future cellular networks.

40|$|As {{the spread}} of digital {{networks}} makes access to data communications globally available, the interest of communication service providers is switching away from the provision of these <b>bearer</b> <b>networks</b> and towards the provision of the value added services that will operate over them. At {{the same time the}} liberalisation of telecommunication markets is precipitating a dramatic change in the profile of communication service providers.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{environment}} in which services are provisioned in existing networks {{has a number of}} shortcomings. Neither the service domain nor the services therein have a standardised structure. Signalling between terminals and services uses network protocols that are inappropriately oriented towards bearer management. The control of bearer connections, and the view of call states, is maintained in the network layer, making bearer management difficult and limited. A service-centric service provisioning environment is proposed, which advocates a structured service domain, and a structured approach to service development and provisioning. A direct communication path between terminals and services at the application layer, that utilises high-level, service-oriented protocols, is proposed. Control of the call / session layer and the <b>bearer</b> <b>network,</b> and view of connection states is relocated to the application layer, facilitating bearer manipulation by services located in the service domain. It is shown that the capabilities and features of services provisioned in the proposed service provisioning environment are of a greater range, more advanced and more complex. It is also shown that the proposed service provisioning environment brings about potential efficiency gains for the initiation of 2 -party calls, and significant efficiency gains for the initiation of multiparty calls...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Future {{orbiting}} sensor constellations {{will consist}} of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of spacecraft, each capable of generating enormous amounts of data. Managing these constellations will require that the spacecraft be autonomous, deciding without human intervention what observations to make and asynchronously reporting results. The need for a robust and efficient shared network infrastructure combined {{with the desire to}} provide direct connectivity between orbiting instruments and scientists on the Internet argues for connecting these sensor constellations directly to the Internet. This paper describes our implementation of an architecture to connect sensor constellations to the Internet based on open standards (Internet and CCSDS protocols). The main elements are: 1) Security (access control, authentication, and encryption) provided by a mix of IPSEC and the more 'space-link-friendly' SCPS-SP security protocols 2) a MobileIP implementation that takes advantage of scheduled contacts to reduce the overhead involved in setting up MobileIP tunnels 3) Resource reservation mechanisms that allow applications to ensure that data are not lost and/or are delivered in a timely manner and 4) a link-layer driver that allows us to easily connect ground and space networks. In a previous paper [1 we verified the feasibility of the above elements in isolation and quantified the performance enhancements they provided though simulation and rapid prototyping. We have recently integrated the elements into an end-to-end prototype, and describe here their implementations. We include information on the standards used, how they have been modified for the particular environment, and the steps required to integrate them into a complete system. We note that the changes to existing standards are minimal and are confined to a small set of hosts that could reasonably be assumed to be {{under the control of the}} spacecraft operators; we require no modification to the underlying <b>bearer</b> <b>network,</b> which we assume to be the Internet...|$|E

An announcement can be distributed in either multicast or unicast fashion. We have implemented both approaches. In case of multicast distribution, we have provided a specific multicast channel, for each package or channel offered by the service provider, to send announcements from the MBS source to clients. In case of unicast distribution, a user periodically receives announcements relevant to its subscribed packages or channels from an announcement server, co-located with the MBS source. In both cases, either the multicast IP address of {{the announcement}} multicast group, or the IP address of the announcement server, is communicated to the client during his subscription to the relevant channel or package. After receiving an announcement, a user can join the multicast group (session join) relevant to the selected content and, after being authorized by the MBSC-SS, the multicast data transfer phase from the MBS source starts. Finally, if either a data stream ends or a user leaves the current session, the session leave signaling exchange closes the <b>network</b> <b>bearers</b> towards the specific subscriber and, if that user is the last one within an MBS zone, network resources are released.|$|R
