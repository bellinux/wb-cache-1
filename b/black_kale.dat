5000|$|Lacinato kale (called cavolo nero, {{literally}} [...] "black cabbage", in Italian {{and often}} in English) is {{a variety of}} kale with a long tradition in Italian cuisine, especially that of Tuscany. It {{is also known as}} Tuscan kale, Tuscan cabbage, Italian kale, dinosaur kale, <b>black</b> <b>kale,</b> flat back cabbage, palm tree kale, or black Tuscan palm. Lacinato kale has been grown in Tuscany for centuries, {{and is one of the}} traditional ingredients of minestrone and ribollita.|$|E
5000|$|The Obamas {{planted a}} {{vegetable}} garden on the South Lawn of the White House on March 20, 2009. This L-shaped 1100 sq ft garden is located by the mansion’s tennis courts {{and can be}} seen from E street. [...] The plot provides more than 55 varieties of vegetables along with fruits that are incorporated into meals made for the Obama family as well as invited guests. Another portion of the yields are donated to the local soup kitchen and the Food Bank Organization. There are 55 varieties of vegetables grown, including: arugula (rocket), cilantro (coriander), tomatillo, hot peppers, spinach, chard, collards, <b>black</b> <b>kale,</b> berries and lettuce. In addition to the seeds selected to be planted are twenty five heirloom seeds and ten different herbs such as anise hyssop and Thai basil. Former presidents' favorite produce will also be sown such as President Thomas Jefferson’s preferred vegetables “Brown Dutch and Tennis Ball lettuce, Prickly Seed spinach and Savoy cabbage” but beets will not be grown as President Obama does not like them. Along with the vegetable garden a beehive was added near the chef’s kitchen that is overseen by Charlie Brandts, a beekeeper and White House carpenter. Honey collected from the beehives has been used to brew White House Honey Ale. The contributing gardeners responsible for {{the early stages of the}} garden include the First Lady herself, White House Horticulturist Dale Haney, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a team of chefs, and fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in Washington. These twenty-three fifth grader advocates, who have grown a garden at their school, helped with digging up the soil, planting, harvesting, and cooking the crops produced. Project facilitator Michelle Obama has made the vegetable garden a priority by requiring hands on assistance from all the family members. In May 2012, the First Lady published American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America, a book detailing her experiences with the Kitchen Garden and promoting healthy eating.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{spectrophotometric}} determination of total polyphenols, flavonoids, glucosinolates and antioxidant activity in seeds, seedlings and leaves of Tuscan <b>black</b> <b>kale.</b> The highest content of hytochemicals {{was observed in}} 10 days sprouts and antioxidant activity was maximum in 2, 4 days seedlings. Identification and characterisation of phytochemicals were performed by mass spectrometry (MS), high resolution and tandem MS with electrospray ionisation mode. Low-molecular-weight metabolites were evidenced in seeds while metabolites at high m/z range were detected in cotyledons and leaves. MS spectra evidenced different phenolic compounds (flavonoid caffeoyl glucose, hydroxycinnamic acid sinapine) and glucosinolates (glucoerucin, glucobrassicin and glucoraphanin) in function of developmental stage; galactolipids ω 3 and ω 6 were observed in leaves. Identification of stages with the highest phytochemicals content encourages the consumption of <b>black</b> <b>kale</b> sprouts and young leaves. Our research can support food and pharmaceutical industries for production of health promoting products from <b>black</b> <b>kale...</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{cruise ship}} {{containing}} the zombified Men-Fish runs aground on Taino, home of <b>Black</b> Talon. <b>Kale</b> teleports the Midnight Sons to the island, as Hellstrom destroys the ship by igniting the engines. Meanwhile, the Hood confers with his cohorts as Dormammu mentally commands the Hood {{to get the}} virus. The Hood goes to the Black Talon's plantation on Taino, with the some of his henchmen. Dormammu warns the Hood that the Midnight Sons are approaching, so he sends the some of his men after the Sons. During a battle against some of zombie Deadpool's creations, Garth escapes with the head. Morbius attacks the zombies with his explosive vaccine, but it mutates into something deadlier, killing Hood's henchmen. Dormammu answers Kale's call for help by offering her great power.|$|R
50|$|Roxanne was revived as a demonic {{servant of}} Blackheart's, bearing the name Black Rose. Black Rose helped unleash the Olympian goddesses of vengeance {{known as the}} Furies to destroy the Ghost Rider and his accursed bloodline. The Furies' fiendish onslaught was expunged from the mortal plane by the Forces of Light, and she found herself cornered by the trio Noble Kale, Blaze, and the young sorceress Jennifer <b>Kale.</b> <b>Black</b> Rose {{was too weak to}} defend herself and was about to meet her death at the hands of Blaze and his hellfire shotgun, but Blackheart intervened and {{revealed}} via a cryptic message to the trio that Black Rose was Roxanne Simpson.|$|R
40|$|Dietary R-{{sulforaphane}} is {{a highly}} potent inducer of the Keap 1 /Nrf 2 /ARE pathway. Furthermore, sulforaphane is currently being used in clinical trials to assess its effects against different tumour processes. This study reports an efficient preparation of enantiopure R-sulforaphane based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of its natural precursor glucoraphanin. As an alternative to broccoli seeds, we have exploited Tuscan <b>black</b> <b>kale</b> seeds as a suitable source for gram-scale production of glucoraphanin. The defatted seed meal contained 5. 1 % (w/w) of glucoraphanin that was first isolated through an anion exchange chromatographic process, and then purified by gel filtration. The availability of glucoraphanin (purity ≈ 95 %, weight basis) has allowed us to develop a novel simple hydrolytic process involving myrosinase (EC 3. 2. 1. 147) in a biphasic system to directly produce R-sulforaphane. In a typical experiment, 1. 09 g of enantiopure R-sulforaphane was obtained from 150 g of defatted Tuscan <b>black</b> <b>kale</b> seed meal...|$|E
50|$|This Ketch/Kale hybrid {{version of}} Ghost Rider {{eventually}} became the King of Hell in a brokered arrangement with then-ruler Blackheart; {{in return for}} Ghost Rider coming to Hell and marrying two hand-picked demon brides, Pao Fu and the Black Rose, Blackheart would free the Ketch line from the curse. Kale accepted. On the night after the dual wedding, <b>Black</b> Rose betrayed <b>Kale</b> and tried to kill him. When she failed, Blackheart revealed that the entire arrangement had been a plan to kill Kale and destroy his soul. Black Rose was revealed to be Roxanne Simpson, the supposedly dead wife of Johnny Blaze. In response, Kale killed Blackheart, became King of Hell, and learned he {{was in fact the}} angel of death.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsumption {{of plant}} foods {{are known to}} reduce the risk of {{developing}} non-communicable diseases. However, many foods are not consumed in their natural state being processed and cooked before ingestion. The objective of this work was to analyze bioactive compounds (phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, proanthocyanins, and anthocyanins), as for individual phenolic acids present in the main ingredients of feijoada whole meal from their uncooked state until the ensemble of the whole meal and evaluate the impact of cooking on antioxidant activity. Analysis of Feijoada whole meal, composed by <b>black</b> beans, rice, <b>kale,</b> cassava flour, and orange showed that black beans are the main provider of phytochemicals and antioxidant activity, with the highest values for phenolics, tannins, and anthocyanins. For flavonoids, kale was the main source. Phenolic acids were mainly observed in black beans and were identified as mainly protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic and ferulic acids. The antioxidant activity, as for the bioactive compounds analyzed, was progressively reduced during processing. For the other ingredients, on the other hand, no significant difference was observed after cooking. As expected, the hydrolyzable fractions showed significantly higher amounts of phenolics and antioxidant activity than soluble fractions. Altogether, feijoada whole meal provides a variety of beneficial health compounds due to its rich composition of distinct food groups such as cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits suggesting that the evaluation of meal as traditionally consumed can be important to identify phytochemicals in the dietary pattern of a population...|$|R
