5|$|The First Triumvirate did {{not approve}} {{the use of the}} flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was {{initially}} unaware of that. He had the flag <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta, on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. When he found out the flag was not approved, he put it away. When asked, he would say that he was keeping it for a great victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1139 Foliot {{was elected}} Abbot of Gloucester, <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> the diocesan bishop on 11June 1139. The {{appointment}} {{had been pushed}} through by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was by then the Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in other respects, for his probable father had been steward to David I, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{came out}} to his and Boo's friends in 1985/1986 and he sold his share in the {{business}} to Boo. They remain friends. In November 1987, Robinson met his partner, Mark Andrew, while on vacation in St. Croix. Andrew was on vacation and worked in Washington, D.C., at the national office of the Peace Corps. On July 2, 1988, Robinson and Andrew {{moved into a new}} house and had it <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> Bishop Douglas Theuner, an event which they considered to be the formal recognition of their life together. Andrew currently works in the New Hampshire state government.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais died on 2 January 1096 {{after falling}} gravely ill on the {{previous}} Christmas Day. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> his former opponent. He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the chapter house at Durham. The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, {{and it is possible}} that the stress of this threat caused his death. In 1796 St-Calais' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at Durham Cathedral. Found in the grave were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.|$|E
5|$|The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is {{dedicated}} to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests {{that it should be}} considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay them so Vishnu took the form of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{served as}} a nurse in Port Royal, {{preparing}} remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery.

At first, she received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought she was getting special treatment. To ease the tension, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.|$|E

5|$|Ambohimanga {{has been}} viewed by many Merina since the late 19th century as the {{embodiment}} of an ideal social order <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> the ancestors. The significance attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to a sense that Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles (andriana) believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction (hasina) to serve as the national capital and imbue national leaders with the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country. The descendents of the andriana have consequently been key in promoting and protecting Ambohimanga, such as by playing a significant role in successfully lobbying UNESCO to list Ambohimanga as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
5|$|The {{additional}} turbo-propulseur {{patent application}} 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With {{the help of}} Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised {{the building of a}} motor sled, powered by a 30hp (22kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The sledge was <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge. A version of Coandă's turbo-propulseur design was shown {{for the second time in}} late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} {{designed}} by Dutch architect W. I. van Bakel in a neogothic style. The construction costs of 110,000 gulden were funded partly by the colonial government, {{as well as the}} sale of unused land and donations from Catholics throughout the colony. The first stone was laid by the pastor Lijnen on 1 October 1870, and construction continued smoothly until 12 May 1873, when the nearly completed tower collapsed; various reasons have been put forward, including an insufficient frame and poor quality bricks. After the collapse, the design of the church was modified to be lower, and further construction was undertaken using bricks imported from the Netherlands as ballast for ships. The construction of the building was completed on 12 December 1875, and the church was <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> Lijnen. It was the first Catholic church in the city, and served mostly those of European or mixed descent.|$|E
5|$|Unmarried princess Kunti is <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> the Sun god {{with a baby}} boy, {{which she}} {{abandons}} in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan and is named Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father and feels heartbroken. He {{does not want to}} become a charioteer like Athirathan, and instead chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.|$|E
5|$|It is {{certainly}} obvious that Jocelin {{was one of}} the most respected figures in the kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had the respect of the secular elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the brother of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King Alexander II, it was Jocelin who performed the baptism. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is <b>blessed</b> <b>by</b> a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
