5|$|The NorthSouth Freeway {{portion of}} Route 42 was {{originally}} planned as a parkway in 1932 that would {{run from the}} Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized. In the late 1940s, the NorthSouth Freeway was proposed by the New Jersey State Highway Department to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed. The Route 42 freeway opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike in Blackwood in 1958. It opened between the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959. With {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth Freeway portion of Route 42, the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E
5|$|Route 42 was {{originally}} designated in 1927 to {{run along the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. In 1953, the southern terminus was cut back to its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 322. After {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959, Route 42 was moved to this freeway, and the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E
5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question. Generally a <b>black</b> <b>horse</b> was required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken {{as a sign of}} vampirism.|$|E
30|$|McGarrigle et al. (1978) report {{interesting}} {{results with}} non included classes. For instance, given cows (two black, two white) and <b>horses</b> (three <b>black,</b> one white) most 5 -year-old children failed the question, “Are there more <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> or more cows?” Their spontaneous justifications {{suggest that they}} consider <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> and <b>black</b> cows. These observations were replicated and extended by Grieve and Garton (1981). They presented 4 -year-old children with either equally or unequally specified questions. Instances of the former case are “Are there more <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> or more <b>black</b> cows?” for between-class comparison and “more <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> or more white horses?” for within-class comparison. These yielded near perfect performance. Instances of the latter case are “more <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> or more cows?” for between-class comparison and “more <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> or more horses?” (that is, the standard class inclusion question) for within-class comparison, which both yielded near complete failure. This was linked with exclusive comparisons, as could be inferred from children’s comments. For the between-class comparisons, the children introduced the qualifier when there was none. In brief, children treat the two sub-classes {{at the same level}} of specificity.|$|R

5|$|The two routes {{continue}} {{to the southeast}} through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, and CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, {{as well as the}} Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting CR 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound; all other movements are provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses US 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing CR 585, the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and the abandoned Bernie Robbins Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from the boardwalk. Through New Jersey, US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C.|$|E

It was {{established}} in 1861 as an extension to the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Inn, hosting music hall events. It was demolished in 1885 and rebuilt and reopened by Edmund Villiers, becoming a theatre in 1918. It subsequently became a cinema, closing in 1982. The site is now part of the Trocadero Shopping Centre.|$|E
5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses with them when they died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed <b>black</b> <b>horse.</b> In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E

5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful <b>black</b> <b>horse</b> inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E

He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he took 7th individually, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal with the French team. The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991), a small <b>black</b> <b>horse</b> with a {{conformation}} and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a {{gold medal at the}} 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} {{small black}} horses that resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the relationship has not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals with them when they left. The small <b>black</b> <b>horse</b> from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, a {{new report}} was released stating that the Route 30 Connector project was feasible. The proposed Connector was to be one mile (1.3km) long, and would be constructed as an elevated highway above the wetlands. Construction cost was estimated at $80 million, half {{of which could be}} paid for by making the Connector a toll road. The new report also identified US 30 as an important roadway for reducing city traffic, as it carried the least amount of traffic and had the greatest capacity out of the city's three major entering highways, the other two being the Expressway and the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike (US 40/US 322).|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} US 40 that {{overlaps}} US 322 follows the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike, a turnpike established in 1855 {{that was to}} run from Camden to Atlantic City via Blackwoodtown. In 1923, pre-1927 Route 18S was created along the current alignment of US 40 east of the Route 48 intersection, running from Penns Grove to Atlantic City. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, the alignment of US 40 in New Jersey ran from Penns Grove, where a ferry carried the route across the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware, east to Atlantic City along pre-1927 Route 18S. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred a year later, pre-1927 Route 18S was replaced by Route 48. In 1936, US 322 was also signed concurrent with US 40 on the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike. The portion of US 40/US 322 that existed in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938. Also by 1938, US 40 was moved to a ferry that ran across the Delaware River between Pennsville and New Castle, Delaware, following current Route 49, local roads, and CR 551 to travel between the ferry and Route 48. Following {{the completion of the}} Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951, US 40 was moved to the new bridge and routed to follow {{a small portion of the}} New Jersey Turnpike and Wiley Road to the current eastern terminus of Route 48. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated concurrencies between U.S. highways and state routes, Route 48 was removed from the portion of US 40 east of its current eastern terminus and the Route 55 designation was dropped entirely.|$|E
5|$|Entering Folsom in Atlantic County, US 322 {{passes a}} couple lakes and some wooded residences {{before coming to}} an {{interchange}} with Route 54, where the route has a median. Past this interchange, the road continues southeast through heavily forested areas to an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 73 (signed as County Route 561 Spur). After this intersection, US 322 turns south and enters Hamilton Township, where it encounters County Route 559 at a traffic circle that has been modified to have US 322 run through it. After passing more woods and a clearing for farms, the road widens into a four-lane divided highway and has an interchange with Route 50. A short while after, the route enters a residential and commercial area, passing by Atlantic Cape Community College before heading {{to the south of}} the Hamilton Mall. Here, US 322 intersects U.S. Route 40, which merges onto the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike.|$|E

The breeding of pure <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> is attended by two problems: some black coats fade with exposure to light and sweat, and breeding two [...] "black" [...] horses together would sometimes produce non-black horses. In some cases, faded true <b>black</b> <b>horses</b> have lighter coats than the darkest near-black horses.|$|R

5|$|Route 73 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 322 (<b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike) in Folsom, Atlantic County, {{heading to the}} northwest on Blue Anchor Road, a two-lane undivided county-maintained road signed as County Route 561 Spur. This portion of the route is officially considered a part of Route 73 but is not signed as such. The road runs through forested areas of the Pine Barrens with some homes and farms, coming to a crossroads with Route 54. Following this intersection, the road continues northwest as Mays Landing Road, crossing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. It enters a small corner of Hammonton before it crosses into Winslow Township in Camden County. Here, Route 73 crosses over a Southern Railroad of New Jersey railroad line and intersects County Route 725. From this point, the road heads north to a partial interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway that has access from southbound Route 73 to the eastbound Atlantic City Expressway and from the westbound Atlantic City Expressway to northbound Route 73.|$|E
5|$|What is now U.S. Route 322 {{east of the}} Route 42 {{junction}} {{was established}} in 1855 as the <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike, a turnpike that ran from Camden to Atlantic City via Blackwoodtown. In 1923, the portion of present US 322 along the US 40 concurrency was designated {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 18S, a route that was built to connect Penns Grove to Atlantic City. As a result of the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 40 was also signed along the alignment Route 18S. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the current alignment of US 322 through New Jersey was designated as a part of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City, while Route 48 replaced the Route 18S designation along the portion between McKee City and Atlantic City. The portion of US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938.|$|E
5|$|East of Williamstown, US 322 {{follows the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike, a turnpike between Camden and Atlantic City {{that was created}} in 1855. Pre-1927 Route 18S was {{designated}} along {{the portion of the}} current route east of McKee City in 1923, with the US 40 designation along this portion following in 1926. In 1927, Route 18S became Route 48 and Route 42 was designated along the road between Williamstown and McKee City. US 322 was extended to New Jersey in 1936, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport east to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1938, Route 55 was legislated along US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City while in 1939, US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now US 130) became Route S44 and the route between there and Route 42 became Route 51. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US 322. After the Commodore Barry Bridge opened in 1974, the old approach to the ferry dock became Route 324. In 1960, a freeway was proposed for US 322 in Gloucester County, running from the site of the Commodore Barry Bridge to Williamstown. This $59.6 million proposal was canceled by the 1970s due to diversion of funds to mass transit. Subsequent proposals for freeways in 1983 and 1995 also failed. A bypass of Mullica Hill was completed in 2012 for US 322 in order to relieve traffic through that town; the former alignment is now unsigned US 322 Bus.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40, {{the road}} enters Buena, Atlantic County and {{continues}} southeast into inhabited areas. After {{running through the}} commercial center of town, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and {{the eastern end of}} CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts. At this point, it enters Buena Vista Township, and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena-Tuckahoe Road. From this point, US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms. The road reaches the residential community of Richland, where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. Upon leaving Richland, the route crosses into Hamilton Township, where it runs through Mizpah before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors. US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552, briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas. The highway intersects CR 559 Truck/CR 606, at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck. The route meets Route 50, where CR 557 Truck splits to the south. Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River. Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area. CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east. A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route. This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound. The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast. US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development. The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 (<b>Black</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike) near the Hamilton Mall. At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts {{for the remainder of the}} route.|$|E
