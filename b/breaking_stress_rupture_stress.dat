The history of rolling mill rolls is simulated by thermo-mechanical metallurgical ﬁnite element code while considering two steps: post-casting cooling and subsequent tempering heat treatment. The model requires a notably large set of material parameters. For different phases and temperatures, Young modulus, yield limit and tangent plastic modulus are determined through compression tests. <b>Rupture</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains are obtained by tensile tests. Thermo-physical parameters are measured by such experimental methods as dilatometry, DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and Laser Flash methods.

From the simulation results, the proﬁle of the stresses evolution at different critical times is presented.

40|$|Carbon fiber overwrapped {{pressure}} vessels {{are known to}} fail from <b>stress</b> <b>rupture,</b> which is a catastrophic failure mode. Because this failure mode {{is a function of}} time and sustained load, composite overwrapped {{pressure vessels}} (COPVs) launch vehicles and spacecraft are particularly susceptible because missions can be of long duration and the operating loads on the composite overwrap are typically high. Mitigation of this failure mode requires appropriate characterization of this <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> lifetime. The current state-of-the-art for <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> characterization is the stochastic modeling of phenomenological data.

40|$|<b>Stress</b> <b>rupture</b> is {{a failure}} {{mechanism}} where failures can occur {{after a period of}} time, even though the material has seen no increase in load. Carbon/epoxy composite materials have demonstrated the <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> failure mechanism. In a previous work, a model was proposed for <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> of composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) and similar composite structures based on strength degradation. However, the original model was limited to constant load periods (holds) at constant load. The model was expanded in this paper to address arbitrary loading histories and specifically the inclusions of ramp loadings up to holds and back down. The broadening of the model allows for failures on loading to be treated as any other failure that may occur during testing instead of having to be treated as a special case. The inclusion of ramps can also influence the length of the "safe period" following proof loading that was previously predicted by the model. No <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> failures are predicted in a safe period because time is required for strength to decay from above the proof level to the lower level of loading. Although the model can predict failures during the ramp periods, no closed-form solution for the failure times could be derived. Therefore, two suggested solution techniques were proposed. Finally, the model was used to design an experiment that could detect the difference between the strength decay model and a commonly used model for <b>stress</b> <b>rupture.</b> Although these types of models are necessary to help guide experiments for <b>stress</b> <b>rupture,</b> only experimental evidence will determine how well the model may predict actual material response. If the model can be shown to be accurate, current proof loading requirements may result in predicted safe periods as long as 10 (13) years. COPVs design requirements for <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> may then be relaxed, allowing more efficient designs, while still maintaining an acceptable level of safety...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for the aging Space Shuttle fleet is the <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> life of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs). <b>Stress</b> <b>rupture</b> life of a COPV {{has been defined as}} the minimum time during which the composite maintains structural integrity considering the combined effects of stress levels and time. To assist in the evaluation of the aging COPVs in the Orbiter fleet an analytical reliability model was developed.

The Shuttle s Kevlar- 49 (DuPont) fiber overwrapped tanks are of particular concern due to their long usage and the poorly understood <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> process in Kevlar- 49 filaments. Existing long term data show that the rupture process {{is a function of}} stress, temperature and time. However due to the presence of load sharing liners and the complex manufacturing procedures, the state of actual fiber stress in flight hardware and test articles is not clearly known. Indeed nonconservative life predictions have been made where <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> data and lifing procedures have ignored the contribution of the liner in favor of applied pressure as the controlling load parameter. With the aid of analytical and finite element results, this paper examines the fundamental mechanical response of composite overwrapped pressure vessels including the influence of elastic plastic liners and degraded/creeping overwrap properties. Graphical methods are presented describing the non-linear relationship of applied pressure to Kevlar- 49 fiber stress/strain during manufacturing, operations and burst loadings. These are applied to experimental measurements made on a variety of vessel systems to demonstrate the correct calibration of fiber stress as a function of pressure. Applying this analysis to the actual qualification burst data for Shuttle flight hardware revealed that the nominal fiber stress at burst was in some cases 23 percent lower than what had previously been used to predict <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> life.

In this thesis studies are reported on the <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> performance of pipes produced from selected polyethylene materials blended to a chosen MDPE pipe grade. The pipes were tested, notched or unnotched, at a single temperature of 80 oC and at internal pressures designed to induce slit-mode failure. Results showed the simple concept of increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> performance of a pipe material by the addition of a higher molecular weight polymer was invalidated when applied to the blends system used in these studies. However molecular weight does have an influence to some degree as was illustrated by the addition of a very low molecular weight material, which produced the poorest <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> properties of the additives used. Charaterization techniques, including Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis, showed good compatibility of the blends at all addition levels studied, illustrating that there was no seperation of the polyethylene phases. Fracture analysis of pipe failures showed variations between the blends, except for a MDPE additive which had similar molecular characteristics to the base resin. Some of the blends fracture surfaces were found to vary in fibre height and distribution from the bore region to the outside of the pipe. On the morphological front spherulites from pipe samples were found to be a poor indication of <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> behaviour. Pipe blends were produced which had fine/featureless morphologies but whose 80 oC <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> behaviour was found to be good and poor in comparison to the control MDPE pipe resin which had a spherulitic structure much larger than all the blends studied. Models presented here infer that a number of mechanisms may be operating in producing these changes in <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> properties. One may be due to a dilution of a polyethylene system by materials of varying molecular weight and molecular weight distributions.
