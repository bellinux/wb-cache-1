40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 96 - 100) The American South in {{the nineteenth}} century was plagued by diseases, including malarial fevers, <b>bilious</b> <b>fevers,</b> and the deadly yellow fever. This study examines how the river-port city of Natchez, Mississippi, the urban hub of a vast slave-plantation hinterland, coped with the yellow-fever epidemics that plagued its people in the 1850 s. It attempts to place the city???s efforts to deal with yellow fever {{in the context of the}} fever???s medical and scientific history before and after the decade in question. The study???s central thesis contends that the white population of Natchez coped with yellow fever in ways shaped and influenced by (1) conventional medical reasoning and prevailing medical ignorance; (2) local concerns rooted in the town???s slave-based, mercantile economy; and (3) the failure of its citizens to abide by even the best, though ill-informed, practices of the day in combating the disease. As a case study, it treats white Natchez as a microcosm of the small-town, slave enshrouded South in the decade leading up to the Civil War...|$|E
40|$|Lantana camara is {{more popular}} as toxic weed rather than {{medicinal}} plant {{in most of}} the countries responsible for infesting pastures, grazing lands, orchards and crops like, tea, coffee, oil palm, coconut and cotton, and reduces the economic viability of the crops. This plant can grow in even in extreme harsh climatic conditions of tropical and sub-tropical areas and has become naturalized worldwide as an ornamental plant including India. The stem, root and leaves contain many of the bioactive compounds responsible for various therapeutic applications such as cancers, chicken pox, measles, asthma, ulcers, swellings, eczema, tumors, high blood pressure, <b>bilious</b> <b>fevers,</b> catarrhal infections, tetanus, rheumatism, malaria, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative and diaphoretic. Besides this, it has some toxic effect by accidental ingestion among the livestock. Best alternate uses of West Indian Lantana started by the people, as it is difficult to eradicate such as household furniture like tables, chairs etc. are made from the stalks [...] Present review indicating that Lantana camara is a versatile ornamental plant species having economic importance and can be promoted for diversified applications like medicinal and other potential uses...|$|E

30|$|Of note, {{numerous}} febrile episodes {{are mentioned}} in the correspondence of Foscolo since the presumed onset of the disease. The term <b>bilious</b> <b>fever</b> (febbre biliosa) used by him is not necessarily associated with a disease of the liver. Actually, “bilious” means the condition was thought to arise from disorders of bile, {{the two types of}} which were two of the four humours of traditional Galenic medicine in 200 A.D., and <b>bilious</b> <b>fever</b> was a medical diagnosis often used for any fever that exhibited the symptom of nausea or vomiting in addition to an increase in internal body temperature. The term is no longer used, but was used by medical practitioners in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Among various definitions for the term bilious fever that have emerged over the past centuries is that of Buchan (1785): “continual, remitting, or intermitting fever accompanied with a frequent or copious evacuation of bile, either by vomit or stool”, of Dunglison (1855): “common remittent fever of summer and autumn” or that of Appleton (1904): “Typhoid fever, remittent fever or simple gastritis”. Similarly, the term cholera morbus used by Foscolo is not obliquely associated with an infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholera, since at that time it was used to describe acute gastroenteritis occurring in summer and autumn marked by severe cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting (Wilson 1832).|$|R

Don José had died in a <b>bilious</b> <b>fever,</b> brought on by excessive dissipation, and at his death the estate was found to be so incumbered that the whole was sold at auction. The slaves were scattered hither and thither to different owners, and Madame Mendoza, with her children and remains of fortune, had gone to live in New Orleans.|$|R
50|$|Lynch {{became a}} company {{commander}} in the First South Carolina regiment on June 12, 1775. He was commissioned by the Provincial Congress. After being appointed, he gathered men and led a march into Charlestown, South Carolina. Amid the march, he became very sick with a <b>bilious</b> <b>fever</b> which prevented him from continuing. When he recovered, {{he was unable to}} fulfill his position in a proper way. During his recovery, he received news about his father's declining health. In hope that he could manage his father's illness, Lynch asked his commanding officer, Colonel Christopher Gadsden, if he could travel to Philadelphia. His request was denied originally, but after receiving news of his election to the Continental Congress, he was allowed to travel to his father.|$|R
50|$|In 1795 Pearson {{published}} A Short Account of the Nature and Properties {{of different}} kinds of Airs so far as relates to their Medicinal Use, intended as an introduction to the Pneumatic Way of Treating Diseases, and in 1798 The Arguments in Favour of an Inflammatory Diathesis in Hydrophobia considered, in which he combats the then prevalent opinion of John Ferriar of Manchester that general inflammation and inflammation of the fauces were the chief pathological conditions in hydrophobia. Pearson expressed the opinion that the case of Dr. Christopher Nugent (died 1775) was one of hysteria, and recommended the omission of bleeding in such cases, the administration of wine, and the application of caustics in regions distant from the bite. In 1799 he published Observations on the <b>Bilious</b> <b>Fever</b> of 1797, 1798, and 1799.|$|R

60|$|This {{long period}} is little checquered with events. Having no taste for public business, and his {{circumstances}} being easy and independent, {{he passed the}} first fourteen years at his seat in Cambridgeshire, in an alternation of study and the recreations of rural life, in which he took much pleasure. But, {{at the end of}} that time, the loss of his sister gave a shock to his spirits, which they did not speedily recover. That she was a lady of superior talents is probable, from her having been admitted to a friendship and correspondence with Mrs. Montague, then Miss Robinson. The effect which this deprivation produced on him was such as to hasten the approach, and perhaps to aggravate the violence, of a <b>bilious</b> <b>fever,</b> for the cure of which by Doctor Heberden's advice, he visited Bath, and by the use of those waters was gradually restored to health.|$|R
