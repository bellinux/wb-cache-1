This method has been developing rapidly {{in recent years and}} it is conceived to be used for predicting failure occurrence. This enables us to determine an optimum time to perform machine preventive maintenance. The aim is to determine this point in time for groups of components, such as electric motors, gear boxes, and even combustion engines. In this paper, we focus on monitoring the technical condition of the medium truck <b>bearing</b> <b>box</b> on which we simulate different field conditions. A measuring device, DEWE 50 / 8, including the DEWEsoft software product of the Dewetron Company, has been used for the actual measurement. Along with the vibrodiagnostics used when determining the technical condition of the <b>bearing</b> <b>box,</b> we have also applied thermography for monitoring thermal changes of individual components. The aim of the research is to determine the moment when a preventive action is to be performed or when to change components before the failure occurs and increases the costs.

40|$|Abstract: Vibration {{and noise}} {{problems}} of the gear system have been widely concerned in recent years. A study of transmission error is conducted to verify {{the sources of the}} vibration and noise. The tooth meshing process is analyzed with consideration of the shaft, <b>bearing,</b> <b>box,</b> tooth deformation, and tooth micro-modification in this paper. The transmission error of a two-stage gearbox is discussed based on a theoretical calculation model of gear transmission error. Then the transmission error is measured in different conditions on a test system of two-stage gearbox. By comparing to the test data, the theoretical model of the two-stage transmission error has been refined and a more reasonable model is presented. The study {{plays an important role in}} reducing vibration and noise of the gear system...|$|E
40|$|Gear {{device is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used and important components in machine system. Minor gear damage may cause serious failures of the entire equipment even huge economic losses. Consequently, it is crucial to detect the gear damage as early as possible to prevent the system from malfunction. Analyzing the vibration signal on gear or gear box {{is one of}} the effective methods to diagnose gear failures. Researchers have done countless studies in this respect and have developed many diagnostic methods based on the analysis of vibration signal in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. However, the diagnosis of gear damage in most widely used methods is usually based on observing the variations of characteristics between the normal gear and damaged gear. The diagnostic result mainly depends on the experience of operators and is unstable. Therefore, it is important to develop some technique for diagnosing gear damage with satisfactory accuracy independent of artificial experience. This study proposes an intelligent method for diagnosing gear tooth surface damage by analyzing the vibration accelerations on gear box and <b>bearing</b> <b>box.</b> To investigate the validity of the proposed method, damage contrast test has been carried out in this study.

40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the cause of high oil temperature of the bearings in a kiln, oil samples extracted from the recovery of lubricant oil and were tested by comprehensive oil analytical techniques (including conventional physical and chemical Analysis, pollution degree detection and ferrography wear particle analysis). Results show that root cause of high oil temperature is improper selection of lubricating oil and serious solid particles pollution of using lubricating oil. Therefore, the application of oil analytical techniques to monitor the oil working condition, to prevent mechanical failure and to extend machine life is very effective. Preface The lubricating oil, which used in the riding wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>box</b> of cement rotary kiln in a medium-sized cement factory, was domestic famous brand of 220 # gear oil. External temperature of the lubricating oil tank had been up to 80 - 90 ℃. In order to keep up the normal temperature, a fan must be used to blow the oil tank. As the oil temperature was too high, the factory can had only reduced the load of the kiln. This situation brought heavy economic loss to the factory. In order to analyze the causes of high oil temperature, propose the solutions, and {{determine the}} lubricating oil recovered would continue to be used or not, engineers arrived on site to surve...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this study, we {{verified}} {{the applicability}} of the energy harvesting technology to the railroad system for real-time wireless sensor networks. The origin of the power for this technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature generated on the axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> from the train’s running environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 12. 97 ∼ 14. 68 ℃. We calculated in the assumption of the basic thermo element of the axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on the axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing.</b> Theoretically, the energy harvesting power of 63. 8 mW can be obtained and thus by using the energy harvesting power {{it will be possible to}} operate the wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Failure of {{the train}} axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> will cause great loss. Now, {{condition-based}} maintenance of train axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> has been a research hotspot around the world. Vibration signals generated by train axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> have nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics. The methods used in traditional bearing fault diagnosis do not work well with the train axle box. To solve this problem, an effective method of axle <b>box</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis based on multifeature parameters is presented in this paper. This method {{can be divided into}} three parts, namely, weak fault signal extraction, feature extraction, and fault recognition. In the first part, a db 4 wavelet is employed for denoising the original signals from the vibration sensors. In the second part, five time-domain parameters, five IMF energy-torque features, and two amplitude-ratio features are extracted. The latter seven frequency domain features are calculated based on the empirical mode decomposition and envelope spectrum analysis. In the third part, a fault classifier based on BP neural network is designed for automatic fault pattern recognition. A series of tests are carried out to verify the proposed method, which show that the accuracy is above 90 %...|$|R
