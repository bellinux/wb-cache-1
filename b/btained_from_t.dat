Transf er sensitivity adds power to the "unambiguous" inequality judgments based on the Pigou-Dalton condition and enables distributions whose Lorenz curves intersect to be conclusively ranked.

The model computes the probability distribution of lead time in a resource-constrained project ne work where iterations take place among sequential, parallel and overlapped tasks. The model uses the design structure matrix representation to capture the information flows between tasks. In each simulation run, the expected durations of tasks are initially sampled using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method and decrease ove time as the model simulates the progress of dynamic stochastic processes. It is assumed that the rework of a task occurs for the following reasons: (1) new information is <b>btained</b> <b>from</b> overlapped tasks after starting to work with preliminary inputs, (2) inputs change when other tasks are reworked, and (3) outputs fail to meet established criteria. The model {{can be used for}} better project planning and control by identifying leverage points for process improvements and evaluating alternative planning and execution strategies.

40|$|A {{non-destructive}} {{characterization method}} using microwaves has been employed {{to determine the}} shallow acceptor concentration in undoped LEC semi-insulating gallium arsenide (SI-GaAs) wafers. Both the above-bandgap steady-state and the below-bandgap transient photoconductivities of SI-GaAs wafers are measured using a Ka-band reflection-type microwave setup in which t ere {{is no need to}} fabricate electrical contacts on SI-GaAs wafers. A photoconductivity model adopted from the two-energy-level defect model for undoped LEC semi-insulating GaAs is used to derive the relationship between the photoinduced microwave response and the concentration of shallow acceptors, mainly carbon. In the above-bandgap hotoconductivity measurement, it is found that the steady-state microwave response is inversely proportional to the square root of the shallow acceptor concentration. In the below-bandgap photoconductivity measurement, the transient microwave response shows an initial fast decay and a second slower decay which has a Na-related ecay time constant. More than 30 undoped LEC GaAs bulk wafers were used in our measurements to establish the correlation. These wafers have a carbon concentration ranging from 3 • 1014 cm- 3 to 7 • 1015 cm-~, determined by LVM infrared absorption. Good agreements have been found between the shallow acceptor concentration <b>btained</b> <b>from</b> the microwave photocon-ductivity measurements and the LVM carbon concentration.

This study employed the use of both numerical as well as experimental settings on the water flowing at lower Reynolds numbers in a corrugated tubes with spiral shape to evaluate the performance of heat in a newly designed corrugation style profile. The total performance of the heat for the corrugation tubes were determined and the mathematical information generated from both the Nusselt number and the factors of friction were equated {{with those of the}} experimentally generated outcome for both standard smooth as well as the corrugated tubes. Analysis of the dat generated revealed improvements in heat transfer ranges of (2. 4 – 3. 7) times those 0 <b>btained</b> <b>from</b> the smooth tubes with significant increase in the friction factors of (1. 7 – 2. 3) times those of the smooth tubes. Based on the findings of study, it was concluded that for extended period and extensive range use, tubes with severity index values at 36. 364 × 10 – 3 could produce better heat performance (1. 8 – 3. 4) at Reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 1300.

40|$|The Rensselaer Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (RIDGE) is a {{continuation}} of the Isolated endritic Growth Experiment (IDGE), which flew on three space flight experiments aboard the space shuttle olumbia. The RIDGE is an extension to the completed flight experiments by IDGE, to further investigate henomenon uncovered in the analysis of data obtained by these earlier efforts. The first two space flight xperiments, USMP- 2 and 3, were conducted with succinonitrile (SCN) as the growth material. Analysis showed hat SCN dendrites closely followed the predictions of Ivantsov for dendrites grown in convection free nvironments, but with important differences. The third microgravity experiment, USMP- 4, used pivalic acid, PVA), a more anisotropic material, for the growth medium. Preliminary analysis found that, while existing olidification theories could closely predict the growth of SCN dendrites the approximation was not as good for ivalic acid. The third flight experiment was equipped with a video capture system. Data obtained from the aptured video contained approximately 30 frames per second of data, over the entire growth process. Initial nalysis of the video has shown that the dendrites grown in PVA exhibit a time dependent growth characteristic and ay not always have reached steady-state growth during the experiment. The purpose of this paper will be to resent continued analysis of the characterization of PVA dendrites as well as further in-depth analysis of the data <b>btained</b> <b>from</b> the video images captured on the final flight experiment...|$|R
