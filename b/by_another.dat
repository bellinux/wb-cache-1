The resulting book was well received by critics and became a New York Times Best Seller. In 2009, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. In 2012, it was adapted as a documentary film for PBS, also titled Slavery <b>by</b> <b>Another</b> Name.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined {{public and}} private responding in a multiple-audience context-a context in which members have varying opinions.

Consequently, they adjust their public attitudes downward. Self-presentational concerns appear to cause this negativity bias: lurkers (those not posting their opinion) were less affected <b>by</b> <b>another's</b> negative opinion. Furthermore, posters presented more than one side when publicly explaining their attitudes. These effects persisted despite posters' favorable product experiences and commitment to these attitudes.
