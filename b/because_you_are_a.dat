We salute you <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> true and living representation of our hopes and ideals, of the determination {{we have to be}} accepted fully as equal beings, of the pride we have held and nurtured in our African origin, of the freedom of which we know we are capable, of the freedom in which we believe, of the dignity imperative to our stature as men.|$|E
500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?" [...] was often directed to her. Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during Meet the Press she was asked, [...] "Do you think that in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> woman?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Psychoanalyst Elsa Cayat, a French Jewish {{columnist}}, was killed. Another female columnist {{present at}} the time, crime reporter Sigolène Vinson, survived; one of the shooters aimed at her but spared her, saying, [...] "I'm not killing you <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> woman", and telling her to read the Quran. She said he left shouting, [...] "Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{interviews}} both Feinstein and Currin have {{commented on}} sexism {{in the art}} world. Feinstein has said [...] "if you are a female artist {{you have to think}} about being female and making work <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> female artist; but I grew up in a home where the only difference between men and women was medical." [...] She believes that she is judged unjustly by her appearance in a way her husband and other males artists are not.|$|E
2500|$|McReynolds's rudeness was not {{confined}} to colleagues on the Court. Once, when called before {{the chairman of the}} Golf Committee at the Chevy Chase club after complaints were filed against him, McReynolds said: [...] "I've been a member of this club a good many years, and no one around here has ever shown me any courtesy, so I don't intend to show any to anyone else." [...] The indignant chairman replied: [...] "Mr Justice, you wouldn't be a member of this club if it wasn't for your official position. The members of this club have put up with your discourtesy for years, merely <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> member of the Supreme Court. But I'm telling you now that the next time there is a complaint against you, you'll be suspended from the privileges of the golf course." [...] Justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter transferred from the Chevy Chase club to Burning Tree because McReynolds [...] "got disagreeable even beyond their endurance".|$|E

2500|$|Women who do {{not follow}} the {{domestic}} norm are looked down upon in society. Beauvoir is explaining that woman referred as “the other.” She states, “What is a woman?’...The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of {{writing a book on}} the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: ‘I am a woman’; on this truth must be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; {{it goes without saying that}} he is a man. [...] It would be out of the question to reply: ‘And you think the contrary <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> man,’ for it is understood that the fact of being a man is no peculiarity.” (34-5) As for man there is no need to define what is to be a man, there is no reason because they identified themselves as the superior part. Man represents both “the positive and the neutral,” which doesn’t need to be explained or defined, and it is self-explanatory. “Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in relation to herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.” (35) Men are the default setting and women are considered a recessive gender. “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.” (35) It is like an asymmetrical comparison, but masculine and feminine aren’t asymmetrical.|$|E
2500|$|Men {{and women}} hold unique roles in Tongan society. A man usually holds {{the power and}} is {{considered}} {{the head of his}} household. However, a man has an obligation to care for his sister and her children. So in Tongan families ones maternal uncle or Fa'etangata, is considered lower in ranking because of his obligation {{to take care of the}} needs of his sister and her children. Contrastly in Tongan families your paternal aunt is the highest-ranking member and is referred to as mehekitanga or Fahu. Men hold power and women hold rank. In ancient Tonga one would inherit titles, land and people from their mother, after Christianity this was changed to mainly inheriting from ones father. Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to be in the same room with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families. At one time it was inappropriate for a brother and sister to even watch television together if the characters were to kiss or even flirt on screen. That is mostly laxed in the modern age, but you still have families that will separate the boys and girls when watching TV or movies. The notion of faka'apa'apa is still strong but the meaning of it is slowly changing especially amongst the youth of the Tongan diaspora. Other key members of Tongan kinship are the 'Ulumotu'a or the oldest male in ones extended family on your father's side, they are usually called upon to be in charge of funerals and other family events. They do not out rank a Fahu but they have power to direct events. Also noteworthy [...] is all of your maternal aunts are called your mothers, likewise you paternal uncles are your fathers. Your cousins on either side are called your brothers or sisters. Similarly if you are female and your sisters children are called your children also <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> mother to them. Same applies if you are a male and your brothers children will refer to you as a father.|$|E
