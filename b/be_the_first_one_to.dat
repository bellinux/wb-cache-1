[...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

50|$|His {{importance}} as author <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> {{fact that he}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> who comprehensively wrote about forestry. His treatise is a compilation of the knowledge about forest management at the time. He used his own experience to expand the scientific knowledge base that remained after the devastation of the Thirty Years' War.

2500|$|On January 7, 2007, Tebow was {{featured}} prominently in an ESPN Outside The Lines feature on home-schooled athletes seeking {{equal access to}} high school athletics in other states. Because a home-schooler's access to public and private school athletic functions vary by state, Tebow and former defensive end Jason Taylor (who was allowed to play at his local high school in Pennsylvania) argued in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states. Upon becoming the first home-schooled athlete to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy, he remarked, [...] "That's really cool. A lot of times people have this stereotype of home-schoolers as not very athletic – it's like, go win a spelling bee {{or something like that}} – it's an honor for me to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> do that." [...] Tebow received the 2008 Quaqua Protégé Award as outstanding home-education graduate.|$|E

2500|$|Clark Rogers, Director of {{educational}} {{programs for the}} National Flag Foundation, {{was quoted as saying}} that he realizes that different branches of the military have their own traditions, but [...] "the United States Flag Code says the flag should not be dipped for any person or thing." [...] The practice of refusing to dip the flag based on the flag code is most well known in regards to the world Olympic Games, where the United States team has refused to dip the flag toward any nation's leaders since 1936. Some United States naval officers have pointed out that [...] "Naval Telecommunications Procedures: Flags, Pennants and Customs" [...] states that the [...] "Navy allows American ships to lower their flags if returning a salute, but not to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> dip their colors." [...] Dipping first is a sign of disrespect as stated in the Flag Code: [...] "No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing." ...|$|E

We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" [...] he said. [...] The President continued that he would “be the first to go hungry. I will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> die of hunger". [...] Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog [...] "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E
