2500|$|Although the Kims had a {{cellular}} phone with them, their remote location in the mountains was {{out of range of}} the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. [...] Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would {{play a key role in}} their rescue. [...] Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. [...] Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains <b>were</b> <b>within</b> a <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>to</b> the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.|$|R

50|$|In a few {{specific}} cases, {{the direct}} interference {{is not a}} limiting factor, due to the transmitter being beyond the horizon or obscured by terrain (such as with the Manastash Ridge Radar), {{but this is the}} exception rather than the rule, as the transmitter must normally <b>be</b> <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> of the receiver to ensure good low-level coverage.|$|R
50|$|After {{the study}} was completed, NASA {{realized}} that a minor system modification was needed to achieve 100% global coverage. A small area would not <b>be</b> <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> of any satellites - a so-called Zone of Exclusion (ZOE). With the ZOE, neither TDRS satellite could contact a spacecraft under a certain altitude (646 nautical miles). With the addition of another satellite to cover the ZOE and ground station nearby, 100% coverage could exist. The space-based network study created a system that became the plan for the present-day TDRSS network design.|$|R

A jet of a fiberizable material is directed towards an uncharged collector from a dispensing location that is {{spaced apart from}} the collector. While the fiberizable material is directed towards the collector, an elliptical electric field is generated via the electrically charged dispenser and an oppositely-charged control location. The field spans between the dispensing location and the control location that <b>is</b> <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> of the dispensing location, and impinges upon at least {{a portion of the}} collector.

50|$|The {{interface}} between the radar and the CDU {{can be either}} RS232C or LAN connectivity. A lightweight, rugged, standard army 2-wire field cable is used for communicating between the radar and CDU. This allows the operators to be positioned up to 100 m away from the radar, {{in the safety of}} trenches, bunkers, or hides. This provides them better security and safety, and allows for greater flexibility in deploying the radar at suitable spots to meet technical and tactical requirements. The use of wired interface also provides a better security from interception and lower noise, and does not require the radar and CDU <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>within</b> <b>Line-of-Sight</b> of each other.|$|R
40|$|The term Bluetooth {{refers to}} an open {{specification}} for a technology to enable shortrange wireless voice and data communications anywhere in the world.

Due to its RF nature, devices need not <b>be</b> <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> and may even connect through walls or other non-metal objects. This allows for applications such as a cell phone in a pocket or a briefcase acting as a modem for a laptop or a PDA.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 IEEEA {{demonstration}} of multiple-input multiple-output over-the-horizon radar is presented. Transmitter signal beam- forming on a multi-element array has been created, not conventionally before transmission at the transmitter facility, but, after radar signal transmission, skywave propagation, target scattering, return signal propagation, and reception using an over-the-horizon radar receiver. Transmitter beam-patterns {{have been created}} simultaneously from the signal received at two widely separated locations. The first <b>is</b> <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> propagation of the end-point of the one-hop ionospheric transmitter to target path, and the second from the signal received at the end-point of the two-hop ionospheric transmitter to target to receiver propagation path. These beampatterns are shown to be practically identical. They reveal the target radar return signal direction-of-departure at the transmitter. This example of a-posteriori transmitter beamforming suggests {{that it will be}} possible to create multiple simultaneous adaptive range dependent transmitter beams with an appropriately designed over-the-horizon radar. This has several applications including for the mitigation of Doppler-spread clutter. G. J. Frazer, Y. I. Abramovich, B. A. Johnson and F. C. Robe...|$|R
5000|$|Sombra is {{classified}} under an [...] "Offense" [...] role in Overwatch. She {{is equipped with}} a low-damage, high-capacity machine pistol for short-range combat. Her abilities allow her to hack enemies and their turrets, which prevents them from using their special or ultimate abilities or picking up health packs, though they may still use primary skills. Sombra's hacks also relay information about the opponent's health and ultimate ability status to her teammates, as long as they <b>are</b> <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> of the opponent, for about a minute from the hack. Her hacks can also be applied to health packs, allowing them to recharge at three times their normal speed, while also disabling their use for enemies. While her hacks on enemies are short, lasting six seconds, her hacks on health packs can last for a minute, unless hacked again before this minute runs out. Sombra may also put down a [...] "translocator" [...] to teleport, and can briefly turn invisible and gain a quick burst of speed to hide behind enemy lines to perform her hacks. Her ultimate ability is an EMP blast that destroys all enemy barriers and shields, along with hacking them in the process.|$|R
30|$|Yao et al. [16] {{presented}} an efficient blind beamformer technique {{to estimate the}} time delays from the dominant source. This method estimated the relative time delay from the dominant eigenvector computed from the time-averaged sample correlation matrix. They have also formulated a source linear equation similar with [12] to estimate the source location and velocity via least square method. Statistical methods [17 – 19] have also been proposed to solve the DOA problem under complex environment. These methods yield superior performance than conventional DOA method especially when the sound source <b>is</b> not <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight.</b> However, a training procedure is needed for these methods to obtain the pattern of sound wave arrival. This may not be realistic for the robot applications when the environment is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more useful}} system was {{introduced}} in the Gee system, which used two timed signals that allowed the navigator on the bomber to determine their location. It could <b>be</b> used anywhere <b>within</b> <b>line-of-sight</b> of the transmitter stations in the UK, and generally provided a reasonable signal up to about 500 km, depending on the aircraft's altitude. Gee was read on an oscilloscope display about [...] across, which limited the accuracy of the timing measurements. As a result, Gee was accurate on the order of kilometers, which was extremely useful for navigation and area bombing, but did not provide the accuracy needed for pinpoint bombing.|$|R
50|$|SIMNET was {{developed}} by three companies: Delta Graphics, Inc.; Perceptronics, Inc.; and Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Inc. There was no prime contractor on SIMNET; independent contracts were let directly {{to each of these}} three companies. BBN developed the vehicle simulation and network software, as well as other software such as artillery, resupply, and semi-automated forces often used for opposing forces. Delta Graphics, based in Bellevue, Washington, developed the graphics system and terrain databases. Delta Graphics was eventually bought by BBN. Perceptronics, based in Los Angeles, was responsible for the actual SIMNET simulators; the company's engineers, human factors personnel and manufacturing team designed, developed and built over 300 full-crew simulators, integrating the controls, sound systems and visual systems into the special simulator shells; they also installed the simulators in a number of facilities in the US and Germany, trained the operators and supported the system for several years. BBN was responsible for developing the dynamic simulation software for each of the simulators, as well as the distributed networking communication software that kept each simulator informed of the position (and other state information) of other simulators that <b>were</b> <b>within</b> potential <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>within</b> the shared virtual environment. Each simulator maintained its own copy of this virtual environment, and broadcast its own state information to the other simulators.|$|R

Early electric key fobs operated using infrared and required a clear <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>to</b> function. These could be copied using a programmable remote control. More recent models use challenge-response authentication over radio frequency, so these are harder to copy and do not need <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>to</b> operate.
