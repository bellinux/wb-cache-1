5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” <b>by</b> <b>referring</b> to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E

5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city <b>by</b> <b>referring</b> to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. <b>By</b> <b>referring</b> to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E
5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film was adapted by from the 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The plot of the Thanhouser production streamlined the actual story to portray the film {{over the course of}} a single reel. The film was released on July 26, 1910, on the same day that Vitagraph released the first reel of their own three reel version of Uncle Tom's Cabin. This prompted the Thanhouser Company to advertise against the Vitagraph film <b>by</b> <b>referring</b> to the other as being overly drawn out. The film garnered mixed, but mostly positive reception in trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Movie {{director}} Kevin Smith {{has been}} a fan of the Degrassi series from the early 1990s, when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Actor Jason Mewes was his co-worker at the store and also became a fan. Every Sunday morning at work, Smith and Mewes watched episodes of Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High on Public Broadcasting Service. Smith enjoyed the earlier series and has acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn. He has also paid homage to Degrassi <b>by</b> <b>referring</b> to it in several of his films. He named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Mistysin's Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as a TV show he wants to watch, rather than going out. Smith and Mewes guest starred as themselves in the final three episodes of the fourth season. The plot for these episodes involves the pair working on Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse, using Degrassi Community School as a filming location.|$|E
