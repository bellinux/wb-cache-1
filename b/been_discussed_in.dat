5|$|The one-sided {{relationship}} has <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> many books. Some question {{the accuracy of}} Kubizek's memoir, the only source for the story.

5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E

5|$|After the incident, Bågenholm {{became a}} subject of fiction and medical textbooks, and her case has <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the leading British medical journal The Lancet. On 25 October 2009 her story was {{featured}} on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death.

Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, road users {{wishing to}} go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main choices. Travel by coach {{involved}} a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further north along the Devon – Cornwall border. The alternative was to catch a ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge's present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. The idea for a fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Parliament as early as 1930.|$|E

5|$|Sweden's {{weak economy}} had {{suffered}} {{during the war}} and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described {{as one of the most}} important held by the Riksdag of the Estates. Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away— including counties, baronies and lordships— could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One of them was the former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room Läckö Castle. The reduction process involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation's finances.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 13 September 1810 was an {{inconclusive}} frigate engagement {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates during which a British frigate {{was defeated by}} two French vessels near Isle de France (now Mauritius), but British reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the French could secure her. The British frigate was HMS Africaine, a new arrival to the Indian Ocean. She was {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Corbet, who had served there the previous year. Corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in Britain over claims that Corbet had either committed suicide at the shame of losing his ship, been murdered by his disaffected crew, or been abandoned by his men, who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command. Whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined, but the issue has <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit.|$|E
