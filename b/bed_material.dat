30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3 a, {{most of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are {{accumulated}} {{at the front of}} the lower part of the flume, and three maximum thickness conditions of the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are used here, which include 13, 16 and 19.

Once the debris avalanche is initiated, the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> will be entrained by the sliding masses, and the final accumulation shape of the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> will be changed. As shown in Fig.  3 b, the entrainment profile refers to the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> accumulated in the flume, and the entrainment depth is the difference between the original profile and the entrainment profile of the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> (where the maximum entrainment depth is the corresponding maximum value).|$|R
40|$|Poultry {{production}} is widely dispersed {{across the globe}} {{and one of the}} important issues for growers is the selection of suitable <b>bedding</b> <b>material.</b> Recently, low supplier of the raw material increases the price of <b>bedding</b> <b>material.</b> This study aimed to evaluate the most suitable biological alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> for poultry production. The effects of moisture content, pH value and ammonia nitrogen absorption by <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> are considered. The selected materials were banana fiber, coconut fiber, oil palm frond fiber and rice straw. Ammonia nitrogen concentration of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> was determined by using HACH spectrophotometer. Based on result, within these four alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>materials,</b> banana fiber shows the best absorbent <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> where the rate of ammonia concentration is increase in-every an hour and followed by rice straw. The more concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> after experiment showed the ability of the material to absorb ammonia nitrogen emission from chicken manure in poultry house.

The aim of this study was to evaluate perlite as a <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> for rodents and to compare it with wood shavings, expanded perlite and corncobs. The animals used in this experiment were 48 male and 48 female Sprague-Dawley rats. The <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> collected from experimental groups were analysed microbiologically. Blood samples from rats were subjected to biochemical analysis for catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde, superoxide and dismutase, and foot pad skins of rats were subjected to histopathological examination. Body weight was determined at the end of the 30 -day period. Perlite as the only <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> had no effect on body weight, and it resulted in less microbial activity compared with the wood shavings, expanded perlite and corncobs. However, using perlite alone had negative effects on the skin, the moisture percentage of bedding and stress parameters. A wood shavingsperlite combination gave better results than perlite alone and appropriate perlite and other <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> mixtures may result in <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> conducive to animal health and welfare.

25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E
25|$|Movement of {{sediment}} {{is important in}} providing habitat for fish and other organisms in rivers. Therefore, managers of highly regulated rivers, which are often sediment-starved due to dams, are often advised to stage short floods to refresh the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and rebuild bars. This is also important, for example, in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, to rebuild shoreline habitats also used as campsites.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the river}} was {{actively}} dredged by Boral Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> by dredges has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature {{of the river and}} the generally muddy nature of the sands removed by dredging created a woefully sludgy clayey sediment load in the river which did not clear.|$|E
40|$|This review {{highlights}} the importance of the <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> for dairy cows in cubicle systems. The aim was to examine how different types of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> affects dairy cow health and welfare in cubicle systems. To answer the questions studies have been gathered in a summary. Dairy cows can suffer from production diseases, such as lameness or mastitis. These diseases are consequences of high milk yields and environmental factors. The choice of housing system, and particularly lying surface and <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> is important for the comfort, health and welfare of the cow. In cubicle systems, a combination of a thick mattress and plenty of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> create optimal conditions. The cow can adapt to the lying surface and/or <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> that are offered but longer resting periods and fewer hock lesions are seen if the cubicles are provided with large amounts of <b>bedding</b> <b>material.</b> Even more important is that the bedding is dry; cows do not want to lie down on wet bedding, which contributes to increased stress for the animals. There are various types of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> used in cubicle systems. In Sweden these are straw (usually cut or shredded), sawdust, wood shavings, sand and peat. In recent years recycled dried manure has appeared as an alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> in Europe. <b>Bedding</b> has several functions. However, <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> may also have disadvantages. Some may increase the risk of mastitis, either by containing microbes or stimulating bacterial growth. Mastitis disrupts production and reduces welfare. In order to maximise the cow's welfare, materials that increase the risk of disease and injury should, if possible, not be used. The conclusion based on this review is that different types of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> clearly have pros and cons regarding cowcomfort and health. The choice of <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> quantity and quality are important to cow's welfare. Additionally, management routines and lying-place hygiene contribute to cow health which is highlighted in several studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the impact of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> on the faecal microflora of horses. Another objective was to investigate the hygienic and physical qualities of the <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> used and how these may change in the course of the trial period. The <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> used were sphagnum peat and wood shavings. Six horses had each <b>material</b> as <b>bedding</b> for a three week period in a change–over experiment. The horses’ ration of roughage was distributed directly on top of the bedding. Faecal samples were collected weekly for measuring of pH and for Terminal restriction length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. T-RFLP analysis is a PCR based method were the size of 16 S rRNA fragments are determined in order to study microbial communities. Samples of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> were collected at the start up an end of each period and sent for hygienic analysing. Samples of the haylage fed to the horses were collected weekly and sent for analysis as one sample per period. Samples were also taken from both materials in the beginning and end of each period for determination of pH, dry matter and water holding capacity. Registrations of indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity were done on a daily basis. <b>Bedding</b> <b>material</b> did not influence the faecal pH. The T-FRLP analysis did not show any impact from <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> on the microflora. Peat had significantly higher water holding capacity compared to wood shavings. Penicillium spp. was the most common mould found in peat and wood shavings. There was no difference in number of aerobic bacteria, yeasts, moulds and thermophilic fungi between peat and wood shavings. The number of aerobic bacteria had increased significantly in both <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> in the end of the periods. In conclusion, <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> does not influence the faecal microflora with the conditions given in this study...|$|R

The aim of this work was to compare time budgets, growth and food intake of growing, finishing lambs housed on either woodchip or straw <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> and also to evaluate the preferences shown by lambs when given a choice of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials.</b> One hundred and twenty-eight spring-born (approximately nine-month-old) Suffolk x Mule (Bluefaced Leicester x Welsh Speckled Face) and Charollais x Mule lambs (mean weight 35. 3 +/- 0. 28 kg) were randomly allocated within breed, sex and weight range to pens of four lambs and housed on either woodchip or straw. They were fed hay and concentrates ad libitum over an eighteen-day period. Lying, standing and eating behaviours were observed at 15 min intervals over 24 h on days 7 and 14 after housing. On day 17 the lambs were moved to the alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> and were observed for a further 48 h to assess the effects on time budgets of a novel <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> in a familiar housed environment. Over all days, the proportions of observations when lambs were either lying, standing, eating hay or eating concentrates were 0. 69, 0. 15, 0. 07 and 0. 06 respectively {{and there were no}} significant effects of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> (P > 0. 05). On the first day after a change to the novel <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> the proportion of observations when lambs were lying fell by 6 % (P 0. 05). The 64 Suffolk x Mule lambs were then used in a preference test in which their use of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> for various activities was observed every 15 min over four consecutive 12 hour days. Lambs used woodchip as a <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> when lying or standing almost twice as often as straw (P 0. 05). There were no significant effects of either sex of lamb, day of observation or prior experience of the <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> on the preference for woodchip (all P > 0. 05). It is concluded that woodchip is a suitable alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> to straw, that is preferred by lambs over straw and is unlikely to affect lamb performance through changes in the proportion of time spent lying, standing or eating.

50|$|If the {{upstream}} {{shear stress}} {{is less than}} the threshold value, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> upstream of the bridge is at rest. This {{is referred to as the}} clear-water condition because the approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment. Thus, any <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> that is removed from a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by the approach flow. The maximum local scour depth is achieved when the size of the scour hole results in a local reduction in shear stress to the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> from the scoured area.|$|E

50|$|Three {{components}} that {{are included in}} the load of a river system are the following: dissolved load, wash load and <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> load. The <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> load is the portion of the sediment that is transported by a stream that contains material derived from the bed. <b>Bed</b> <b>material</b> load typically consists of all of the bed load, and the proportion of the suspended load that is represented in the bed sediments. It generally consists of grains coarser than 0.062 mm with the principal source being the channel bed. Its importance lies in that its composition is that of the bed, and the material in transport can therefore be actively interchanged with the bed. For this reason, <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> load exerts a control on river channel morphology. Bed load and wash load (the sediment that rides high in the flow and does not extract non-negligible momentum from it) together constitute the total load of sediment in a stream. The order in which the three components of load have been considered - dissolved, wash, <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> - {{can be thought of as}} progression: of increasingly slower transport velocities, so that the load peak lags further and further behind the flow peak during any event.|$|E

This research studied the effect of {{concentration of}} <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> on combustion efficiency during waste incineration. The size of <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> combustion temperature, and excess air factor were controlled to assess the concentration of carbon monoxide. The pressure drop was measured to evaluate the bed expansion and calculate the concentration of <b>bed</b> <b>materials.</b> Experimental {{results indicated that the}} concentration of carbon monoxide did not decrease with the decrease of residence time and increase of excess air factor. With higher heat transfer efficiency, the combustion time could be reduced and the combustion efficiency would be improved. The concentration of carbon monoxide at 700 degreesC was higher than that at 800 and 900 degreesC. The influence of heat transfer efficiency on combustion efficiency was significant as the operating temperature was higher than 700 degreesC. The concentration of carbon monoxide decreased with increasing static bed height. In addition, the size of <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> affected the mixing and heat transfer efficiency in the sand bed.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 b, once the {{high-speed}} sliding masses encounter the <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> an intense impact occurs causing the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> to spray {{forward with a}} high velocity. After the impact with the substrate, some debris materials bound upward and make additional contact with the bed, which causes secondary collisions. With the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> constantly impacted by the upper sliding masses, the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are scoured by the debris and gradually causing deep cuts (Fig.  6 c, d). Hence, the subsequent mass will not cause further spray of the <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> but instead compresses them and pushes the material forward. During the impact and scouring of the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> at the impact area, compression ridge forms {{in front of this}} position because of collision and compression of the debris avalanche on the frontal static substrate materials (Marr et al. 2001). Furthermore, a thin layer {{on the top of the}} substrate is activated to move under the drag of the debris avalanche because the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are loosely piled and have low resistance strength. According to the videos, the velocity of this layer is slightly slower than the debris avalanche, but it moves synchronously after being accelerated. The thickness of this layer becomes thinner along the accumulation section. In the moving process of the entrained materials, some of the materials are involved in the debris avalanche and move forward together with the debris avalanche. The debris loses considerable energy during the collision with the substrate. Therefore, its velocity decreases substantially at the impact zone, which hinders the following mass from moving forward. As a result, a majority of the debris materials are deposited near the impact area. In the process of our experiment, injection of the debris into the substrate was also observed.|$|R
