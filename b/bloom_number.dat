40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to prepare {{networks}} of <b>Bloom</b> <b>number</b> 300 gelatin and genipin as degradable biomaterials. The cross-linking ability of genipin on gelatin was studied and discs were made from the genipin-fixed gelatin. The swelling ratio, the degree of cross-linking, and the rate of degradation of the discs were measured using ninhydrin assay and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. The results indicated that genipin is a good cross-linker for the gelatin. Additionally, varying the concentration of genipin can control the rate of degradation and the degree of cross-linking of the genipin-fixed gelatin. Finally, the concentration of genipin should exceed 0. 5 % of the overall weight of the gelatin-based material if a complete cross-linking reaction between gelatin and genipin molecules is required.

40|$|Sunflower, Helianthus annus L., {{native of}} North America, is widely grown for oil, bird feed, and human snacks. More recently, {{sunflower}} is gaining acceptance as an ornamental potted plant {{and as a}} cut flower in the florist industry. The objectives {{of the present study}} were: 1. To evaluate diverse cultivars of sunflower for their performance under field and greenhouse conditions. 2. To explore the potential of sunflower in the local florist industry. 3. To exhibit the diversity of sunflower characteristics to the public. In 2004, studies were conducted during the spring and summer in the field and during fall and winter in the greenhouse. Commercial seed catalogs were used to obtain diverse cultivars. In the field study seeds were sown according to the prescribed spacing and depth in a randomized complete block design. Severe soil crusting necessitated replanting. Plants were observed from emergence to maturity for horticultural traits such as days to first leaf emergence, height of the plant, days to <b>bloom,</b> <b>number</b> of heads, and branching characters. When observed performance was compared with the catalog description, similarities were found for flower color and head diameter; however, differences were found for plant height and days to bloom. Aesthetic characteristics were evaluated in the field and in the laboratory as cut flowers. Preliminary results indicated that ornamental sunflower cultivars performed well in Kentucky even in an unusually wet, cool growing season. Inconsistency between catalog descriptions and observed performance indicates the need for growers to test promising varieties on a small scale before making large investments. In the greenhouse study cultivars produced fewer branches and heads compared to their field performance. Some cultivars failed to produce flowers under greenhouse conditions. Sunflower heads were found to be attractive and pleasing {{to a wide range of}} individuals. These preliminary results indicate that ornamental sunflower could become a niche crop in Kentucky agriculture.

Study Design: Split-plot, replicated three times. Genotypes were fixed effect while plots (main 60 m² and subplot 12 m²) were random effects. The sub-plot consists of 4 rows 5 m long with 60 cm and 10 cm inter and intra-row spacing. Place and Duration: El Gantra, Range and Pasture Farm in Sennar State of the Sudan during 2009 and 2010 cropping season. Methodology: Five soybean genotypes NA 5009 RG; TGx 1904 - 6 F, TGx 1740 - 2 F, TGx 1937 - 1 F and Soja were evaluated. A strain of Rhizobium japonicum {{was used for}} inoculation {{at a rate of}} 10 g per kg of soybean seed using a sugary solution in 2009. Inoculation was not carried out due to the assumption that the field had the remnant of inoculum effect in 2010. All the recommended soybean agronomic practices were equally applied. Number of days to 50 % flowering was recorded on plot basis when almost half of the sub-plot flowers. Ten plants were randomly selected on plot basis to quantify these traits: Plant height was measured as from ground surface to the base of meri-stem of the mother plant. Number of branches was computed as an average count of branches per plant. Leaf area was computed using Iamauti [12] empirical relationship. The first pod height was measured at full <b>bloom.</b> <b>Number</b> of seeds per pod was counted at physiological maturity of the crop. 100 -seed weight was determined randomly from a seed bulk using a digital weighing machine. Seed yield was quantified after harvest and converted into kg/hectare. Results: The effect of genotype (G), environment (E) and G × E interactions on pod number per plant; plant height, first pod height, number of branches per plant, leaf area, number of days to 50 % flowering and seed yield were found significant at P= 0. 05. The highest mean seed yield was obtained from TGx 1937 - 1 F (0. 98 t/ha). Beside TGx 1740 - 2 F, TGx 1904 - 6 F and Soja were significantly higher than NA 5009 RG in all environments for seed yield. TGx 1937 - 1 F was an intermediate maturing and best in terms of number of pods per plant, number of branches per plant, and leaf area. Correlation coefficient for seed yield showed significant association with days to 50 % flowering and leaf area. Conclusion: The best genotype for seed yield across the environments was TGx 1937 - 1 F and TGx 1740 - 2 F, TGx 1904 - 6 F and Soja were intermediate and NA 5009 RG was the least. Thus, partitioning G × E into adaptability and phenotypic stability will positively address the information gap on association of traits to yield. Peer Revie...|$|E

40|$|Background It is {{hypothesised}} that an anatomical simulant model, that replicates the heterogeneous {{nature of}} human organs and tissues, will provide a more reliable and accurate method of evaluating the pathological features and incapacitation potential of ammunition in a weapons system than homogeneous bare ordnance gelatine alone. The use of frozen and thawed cadavers for simulant development was also examined. To develop a model, the most critical organs and tissues that sustain bullet wound trauma within the thorax and abdomen must be determined. Next a suitable method for establishing and matching the relevant biomechanical properties with candidate simulant materials must be developed, and an appropriate scoring system adopted. Method De-identified wound trauma data from 197 homicidal gunshot post mortem examinations in Israel were obtained between 2000 - 2001 and 2004 - 2008. The corresponding forensic ballistics data was only available for the cases between 2004 and 2008. The major organs involved, type of wounds, cause of death (COD), most common bullet paths, distances involved, firearm calibres and bullet types were established. Tensile strength tests were undertaken on selected tissue samples from an un- embalmed cadaver that had been frozen and thawed five times, which maximised the effects of repeated cycles. The universal test equipment Hounsfield H 50 KM machine was used to apply uniaxial tension until tissue failure occurred. The maximum tensile strength results in g/mm² were compared against corresponding data from the literature. Energy loss tests were conducted on fresh porcine organs/tissues using steel 4. 5 mm BB pellets fired from a Daisy® brand air rifle. Each organ/tissue was tested at room temperature and 37 °C (body temperature). They were compared to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) specification ordnance gelatine, {{as well as a}} candidate simulant material. A limited number of tests were also conducted at 4 °C for further comparison purposes. Two chronographs measured BB pellet velocity before and after each test material was perforated and the difference was established in m/s. The resulting energy loss was established using the formula KE = ½ mv². FBI and NATO specified ordnance gelatine of 250 and 285 Bloom strengths were manufactured using tap water, reverse osmosis (RO) water and de-ionized water. They were allowed to cure for 21 hours, 100 hours and 3 weeks. The FBI calibration standard was used for all formulations as there is no separate standard for the NATO formulation in the literature. An Australian Defence Force (ADF) AUSTEYR model F 88 ICW (individual combat weapon) in calibre 5. 56 x 45 mmNATO was used with standard issue ASF 1 ball ammunition. Large FBI specification ordnance gelatine blocks were manufactured and thin gelatine/composite plates were used to simulate subcutaneous tissue and fat, as well as to provide a platform for the attachment of a skin simulant and to embed bone/rib composite within. A 250 mm air gap and bubble wrap was used to simulate an expanded lung. The gelatine/composite plates were secured to a wooden cradle and the gelatine blocks were positioned behind it. The F 88 ICW was fixed in a remote firing device 50 m from the target and a chronograph 3 m in front of the rifle measured bullet velocity. Test results were recorded using two high speed ‘Photron Fastcam’ digital cameras. Maximum three dimensional permanent cavity dimensions were obtained using a vernier gauge, and temporary cavity measurements were taken from high speed video images. Results The homicide study established that males represent 91 % of gunshot victims. Of the 999 bullet wounds recorded, males were struck in the body an average of 5. 2 occasions, with 2. 2 of these bullets striking the thorax and/or abdomen. A contributing factor to the frequency of bullet strikes was the type of firearms involved, namely semi automatic pistols in the predominant calibre 9 mm Luger, and assault rifles in calibre 5. 56 x 45 mm and calibre 7. 62 x 39 mmSoviet. Full metal jacket bullets were used in most instances and the majority of shootings (N= 124) occurred at ranges estimated at 1 m or greater. The most common bullet path was front to back in 66 % of cases, followed by back to front in 27 % of cases. Entry wounds occurred more often {{on the left side of}} the thorax, abdomen and back (N= 253) compared to the right (N= 172). The most common critical organs/tissues to sustain bullet trauma in descending order were; heart, lungs, liver, aorta, spleen, kidneys and vena cava. Ribs were struck by most bullets that entered the thorax. Multiple organ injury was listed in 146 of the 192 cases where a specific COD was determined by the pathologist. The following tensile strength results were achieved from the cadaver study: heart 3. 56 g/mm², kidney 10. 27 g/mm², oesophagus 22. 08 g/mm², skeletal muscle 29. 46 g/mm², ascending aorta 59. 98 g/mm², trachea 155. 40 g/mm², spleen 4. 65 g/mm², liver 10. 83 g/mm², pancreas 15. 18 g/mm², lung 29. 94 g/mm², pericardium 136. 84 g/mm², skin (abdomen) 355. 26 g/mm² and skin (thorax) 407. 88 g/mm². These data were compared to published results obtained from non-frozen tissues from elderly persons, recognising that tensile strength values were only available for the following organs and tissues at the 95 % degree of confidence: heart 9. 2 ± 0. 95 g/mm²; kidney 4 ± 0. 20 g/mm², oesophagus 51 ± 1. 1 g/mm², skeletal muscle 9 ± 0. 30 g/mm², ascending aorta 68 ± 2. 4 g/mm², trachea 150 ± 6. 5 g/mm². It can be seen that some results from the test cadaver were higher and some lower than the published results, with trachea recording the only similar result. This indicates that the freezing and thawing process may change the tensile strength of tissues in unpredictable ways. Therefore, bio- mechanical research should avoid the use of frozen/thawed tissues and organs. The major agreement between the porcine energy loss tests were: FBI specification gelatine was similar (p> 0. 05) to heart and lung at room temperature and 37 °C; spleen was similar to NATO specification gelatine at room temperature and 37 °C; candidate Simulant ‘A’ was similar to hindquarter muscle at room temperature and 37 °C and hindquarter muscle, kidney and spleen were similar to each other at room temperature and 37 °C. Liver and kidney, and liver and fat were similar to each other at 4 °C. The use of different water types had no effect upon ordnance gelatine calibration results. However, different temperatures, concentrations and curing times did have a significant effect. Neither of the two NATO 20 % formulations met the same calibration standard as the FBI 10 % formulation. The penetration depths achieved for the FBI formulations at both 3 °C and 4 °C were closest to the recommended calibration standard after 3 weeks curing time. A 20 % concentration of 285 Bloom at 20 °C met the same FBI calibration standard after 100 hours of curing and can be considered comparable. The anatomical model pilot tests demonstrated the benefit of using simulants that are more representative of the heterogeneous {{nature of human}} organs/tissues. It was found that by combining skin, bone and other simulant materials with ordnance gelatine, the behaviour of a military full metal jacket (FMJ) rifle bullet changes with regard to the earlier onset of temporary cavitation, reduced penetration depth and a higher degree of bullet yaw compared to simulations using only bare FBI specification ordnance gelatine. This occurs because more energy is consumed negotiating the various anatomical simulants, which means wounding is likely to occur much earlier, and organs that are deeper within the body may not be affected to the same degree. These factors will impact significantly upon injury severity in real tactical scenarios. Conclusion The experimental studies provide the framework for the development of a heterogeneous model for bullet trauma simulations of the thorax and abdomen. This model would be more representative of actual wound trauma than bare ordnance gelatine alone. This conclusion was arrived at by identifying the most critical organs/tissues for modelling purposes. Their energy loss values (J/m) were established and the method adopted allows for comparable simulants to be developed. Porcine energy loss tests showed that FBI specification gelatine is similar to heart and lung, but different to hind quarter muscle and most of the other ‘critical’ organs and tissues within the thorax and abdomen. NATO specification gelatine is a suitable simulant for spleen, and test Simulant ‘A’ is a suitable simulant for both hindquarter muscle and kidney. A separate simulant would be required for liver, fat and aorta. Frozen and thawed cadaveric tissue was shown to produce unpredictable tensile strength data and is therefore unsuitable for simulant development. The limitations of using FBI and NATO specification ordnance gelatine was highlighted when changes to <b>bloom</b> <b>number,</b> temperature and curing times altered calibration results. Therefore, temperature stable synthetic simulants such as Simulant ‘A’ are preferable. The anatomical model pilot tests clearly demonstrated that the addition of simulant materials directly affects wound severity simulations compared with bare ordnance gelatine alone. This in turn affects interpretation of real life situations. The AIS 2005 / 2008 and MAXISS scoring systems are deemed appropriate to grade the lethality potential of model simulations. Therefore, the original hypothesis has been validated. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medical Sciences, 2014...|$|E

ARISA was able to resolve, on average, 27 bacterial band classes per sample and allowed for a detailed investigation of the explicit richness and diversity.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Pollen {{development}} {{is an important}} process in male flower development, the timing {{of which may be}} correlated with time of pollen shed in hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.). Early to very late blooming cultivars were identified and the relationship of microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis, and time of pollen shed were studied in nine hazelnut cultivars. Most advanced catkins from a single tree of each cultivar were collected each week from 4 Aug. to 6 Dec. 2002, and on 17 Jan. 2003, stained and analyzed by light microscopy. The phenology part of this dissertation studied the role of the chilling requirement as chill units (CU) and heat requirement as growing degree hours (GDH) in pollen shed. Hazelnut twigs of three cultivars; 'TGDL', 'Barcelona', and 'Hall's Giant' were collected at weekly intervals starting from early Fall 2006 through the time of anthesis in the field in winter 2007. Twigs were then held at a different constant temperature 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 °C. Observing these twigs weekly, the time of anthesis (50 % pollen shed) was recorded. A parallel study was conducted in more controlled conditions by collecting hazelnut twigs of the same three cultivars on 1 Nov. 2006 and holding them at 5 °C in a cold room. Five twigs of each genotype were brought out to room temperature at 5 -day intervals in order to force them to <b>bloom.</b> <b>Numbers</b> of catkins that shed pollen were recorded every 5 days. From the results, we propose a model of hazelnut staminate flower development that begins with catkin differentiation concurrent with early stages of pollen development. Catkin length increased steadily and reached a lag phase at the end of microsporogenesis. While there is no external change, microspores continue microgametogenesis, the catkins are endodormant, unable to be induced to shed pollen, and accumulate chilling during this period of time. We propose that the chilling requirement is met when pollen reaches the mature stage and when catkins are in the latter stages of the lag phase of growth. At this point, GDH accumulate and catkins become ecodormant. As chilling continues to accumulate, the amount of GDH required for pollen to shed is reduced. A similar quantity of GDH was required for all genotypes from pollen grain maturity to catkin elongation...|$|R

40|$|Ciguatera is an {{important}} form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of seafood. The disease is characterised by gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular disturbances. In cases of severe toxicity, paralysis, coma and death may occur. There is no immunity, and the toxins are cumulative. Symptoms may persist for months or years, or recur periodically. The epidemiology of ciguatera is complex and of central importance to the management and future use of marine resources. Ciguatera is {{an important}} medical entity in tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and in the tropical Caribbean. As reef fish are increasingly exported to other areas, {{it has become a}} world health problem. The disease is under-reported and often misdiagnosed. Lipid-soluble, polyether toxins known as ciguatoxins accumulated in the muscles of certain subtropical and tropical marine finfish cause ciguatera. Ciguatoxins arise from biotransformation in the fish of less polar ciguatoxins (gambiertoxins) produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus, a marine dinoflagellate that lives on macroalgae, usually attached to dead coral. The toxins and their metabolites are concentrated in the food chain when carnivorous fish prey on smaller herbivorous fish. Humans are exposed {{at the end of the}} food chain. More than 400 species of fish can be vectors of ciguatoxins, but generally only a relatively small number of species are regularly incriminated in ciguatera. Ciguateric fish look, taste and smell normal, and detection of toxins in fish remains a problem. More than 20 precursor gambiertoxins and ciguatoxins have been identified in G. toxicus and in herbivorous and carnivorous fish. The toxins become more polar as they undergo oxidative metabolism and pass up the food chain. The main Pacific ciguatoxin (P-CTX- 1) causes ciguatera at levels = 0. 1 mug/kg in the flesh of carnivorous fish. The main Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX- 1) is less polar and 10 -fold less toxic than P-CTX- 1. Ciguatoxins activate sodium ion (Na(+)) channels, causing cell membrane excitability and instability. Worldwide coral bleaching is now well documented, and there is a strong association between global warming and the bleaching and death of coral. This, together with natural environmental factors such as earthquakes and hurricanes, and man-made factors such as tourism, dock construction, sewage and eutrophication, may create more favourable environments for G. toxicus. While low levels of G. toxicus are found throughout tropical and subtropical waters, the presence of <b>bloom</b> <b>numbers</b> is unpredictable and patchy.

Five different growth media including coconut compost, silt, soil, leaf manure, leaf manure mix (silt + leaf manure + coconut compost; 1 : 1 : 1) were used for growing zinnia. The experiment was laid out in Complete Randomized Design giving equal importance to treatments. <b>Number</b> of flowers, <b>blooming</b> period, <b>number</b> of lateral branches per plant, number of leaves per plant, plant height (cm), leaf area(cm 2), days to first flower emergence, size of flower and flower quality were determined. The properties of each medium, including water holding capacity (saturation percentage), pH, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium were also determined. Plant height (cm), number of leaves per plant, number of side branches, days to first flower emergence and number of flowers were affected significantly when plants were grown in leaf manure mix. Coconut compost gave maximum size of flowers which was significantly greater than soil. Flower quality was found to be non-significantly affected with the use of various growth media. It is therefore opined that the utilization of coconut compost, silt and leaf manure is a good source of NPK. Therefore, utilization of growing media in combinations proves more effective for the good growth and flowering of zinnia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{ecological}} {{impacts of}} Hydrodictyon reticulatum blooms (1989 - 94) were studied at Lake Aniwhenua (a constructed lake) in North Island, New Zealand by collating fish, invertebrate and macrophyte data collected {{towards the end}} of a four year bloom period and following its decline. Hydrodictyon reticulatum had some localised impacts on the biota of the lake. Some macrophyte beds were smothered {{to the extent that they}} collapsed and disappeared, and dense compacted accumulations of H. reticulatum caused localised anoxic conditions while it decayed. However, fish and some invertebrates in the lake benefited from the H. reticulatum <b>blooms.</b> High <b>numbers</b> of Ceriodaphnia sp. (maximum, 5. 5 x 104 m- 2) were recorded amongst H. reticulatum, and gastropods were exceptionally abundant, the most common being Potamopyrgus antipodarum (maximum, 1. 8 x IOS m- 2). Hydrodictyon reticulatum was consumed by three species of common gastropods in experimental trials, with Austropeplea tomentosa consuming up to 1. 3 g dry weight H. reticulatum g- 1,live weight of snail day- 1. Gastropods comprised the major portion of the diet of Oncorhynchus mykiss in Lake Aniwhenua during and after the H. reticulatum bloom. A marked peak in sports fishing (with exceptional sizes and numbers of fish caught) coincided with the period of H. reticulatum blooms and the abundant invertebrate food source associated with the blooms...|$|R
40|$|Coccolithophore blooms are {{significant}} {{contributors to the}} global production and export of calcium carbonate (calcite). The Patagonian Shelf is a site of intense annual coccolithophore blooms during austral summer. During December 2008, we made intensive measurements of the ecology, biogeochemistry, and physiology of a coccolithophore <b>bloom.</b> High <b>numbers</b> of Emiliania huxleyi cells and detached coccoliths (> 1 ?×? 103 ?mL? 1 and > 10 ?×? 103 ?mL? 1, respectively), high particulate inorganic carbon concentrations (> 10 ?mmol C m? 2), and high calcite production (up to 7. 3 ?mmol C m? 2 d? 1) all characterized bloom waters. The bloom was dominated by the low-calcite-containing B/C morphotype of Emiliania huxleyi, although a small ( 30 %, similar to estimates for E. huxleyi and indicative of a significant role for this diatom in bloom biogeochemistry. Cell-normalized calcification rates, when corrected for {{a high number of}} nonactive cells, were relatively high and when normalized to estimates of coccolith calcite indicate excessive coccolith production in the declining phase of the bloom. We find that low measures of calcite and calcite production relative to other blooms in the global ocean indicate that the dominance of the B/C morphotype may lead to overall lower calcite production. Globally, this suggests that morphotype composition influences regional bloom inventories of carbonate production and export and that climate-induced changes in morphotype biogeography could affect the carbon cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the differences in flowering pattern and fruit quality between long shoots and spurs in apricot cultivars grown in Campania, a region of Southern Italy. The trial was carried out on apricot trees of autochthonous cultivars (‘Portici’, ‘Prete Bello’ and ‘Pellecchiella’) and Ninfa’, an early ripening cultivar. Trees, trained to Y trellis, were spaced 4. 5 x 3. 0 m and grafted onto myrabolan. At budbreak, fruiting shoots were selected on the trees (60 fruiting shoots/type/cultivar) and the number of flower buds/fruiting shoot was counted. At <b>bloom,</b> the <b>number</b> of open flowers/shoot was counted every second day. Fruit set was also recorded on the same fruiting shoots. At harvest, fruits were collected and their size, weight, skin colour, flesh firmness, soluble solid content and titratable acidity were measured. The results indicated significant differences in the time and length of flowering among cultivars. The cv. Ninfa showed the most synchronous pattern of flowering, whereas the Vesuvian cultivars had a lower percentage of opened flowers and more heterogeneity. In these cultivars the flowering pattern was different among fruiting shoot types. The percentage of fruit set was also different among the cultivars varying from 11. 13 % (cv. Prete Bello) to 48. 6 % (cv. Pellecchiella). Fruit quality was strongly dependent on the cultivar productive habit...|$|R
40|$|The Fisheries Research Centre had {{a number}} of reports of {{discoloured}} water between Brittas Bay Co. Wicklow and Wexford Harbour and south to Kilmore Quay. Samples of water received from Dr. David Jeffrey, Department of Botany TCD, collected from Penny-come-quick beach, co. Wicklow on June 17 th and examined by Tom Dunne in the Laboratory contained dense colonies of Phaeocystis pouchetii - a microscopic algae. Subsequent samples collected by Miss Ann Kiley, Wexford County Council, traced the extent of the bloom as far south as Neamstown near Kilmore Quay. A sample taken at Cullenstown west of Kilmore Quay was clear. Also associated with this <b>bloom</b> were large <b>numbers</b> of needlelike diatoms (Nitzschia spp. More seriously, blooms of another microscopic alga (Prorocentrum minimum) began to develop in early July during the later phase of the Phaeocystis bloom...|$|R
40|$|Passion fruit {{has great}} {{potential}} to attract for its lucrative flavor, taste and deliciousness to grown up the economic {{condition of the}} framer in the developing country. Study of flower blooming can play vital role in developing high yielding varieties of this fruit. Filed and laboratory experiments were conducted at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur, Bangladesh to determine the flowering behavior of yellow passion fruits (Passiflora edulis Sims.) at five flashes. The results revealed that third flash showed the best performance in respect of all floral biological attribute namely floral primodia initiation, period of flower bud formation to <b>blooming,</b> flowering duration, <b>number</b> of floral bud, <b>number</b> of flower <b>bloomed,</b> percent flowers opened, flowering interval, bud size, initiation, completion and withering of floral parts. Thus, the results may be concluded that third flash would the best for better fruit production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anecdotal {{evidence}} {{reported an}} outbreak of symptoms on Fraser Island during the late 1990 s similar to those expected from exposure to dermotoxins found in the cyanobacterium L. majuscula. This coincided {{with the presence of}} a bloom of L. majuscula. Methods Records from the Fraser Island National Parks First aid station were examined. Information on cyanobacterial blooms at Fraser Island were obtained from Queensland National Parks rangers. Results Examination of first aid records from Fraser Island revealed {{an outbreak of}} symptoms predominantly in January and February 1998. Conclusion During a bloom of L. majuscula there were numerous reports of symptoms that could be attributed to dermotoxins found in L. majuscula. The other four years examined had no L. majuscula <b>blooms</b> and the <b>number</b> of L. majuscula symptoms was much reduced. These cases comprised a high percentage of the cases treated at the first aid station. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{multilayer}} perceptron neural networks (NNs) with standard logistic regression (LR) to identify key covariates impacting on mortality from cancer causes, disease-free survival (DFS), and disease recurrence using Area Under Receiver-Operating Characteristics (AUROC) in breast cancer patients. From 1996 to 2004, 2, 535 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer entered into the study at a single French centre, where they received standard treatment. For specific mortality as well as DFS analysis, the ROC curves were greater with the NN models compared to LR model with better sensitivity and specificity. Four predictive factors were retained by both approaches for mortality: clinical size stage, Scarff <b>Bloom</b> Richardson grade, <b>number</b> of invaded nodes, and progesterone receptor. The results enhanced the relevance of the use of NN models in predictive analysis in oncology, which appeared to be more accurate in prediction in this French breast cancer cohort...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variation}} in moisture supply and of level of illuminance during seed formation {{on the development of}} hardseededness and on the seed production of Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano were studied in two glasshouse experiments. Verano plants were grown in pots containing 1. 6 kg soil and were watered daily to field capacity until early flowering (43 days after seedling emergence). From day 43 to day 116, the plants were watered every 1, 2, 3 or 4 days. Leaf water potential immediately before rewatering varied from c. - 20 to- 28 bars in the 4 -day treatment. Yields of seed pods were 5. 8, 4. 6, 3. 8 and 3. 8 g in the I-, 2 -, 3 -and 4 -day treatments respectively. Severe water stress greatly reduced inflorescence density, had lesser negative effects on frequency of <b>blooming,</b> floret <b>number,</b> seed setting and proportion of florets forming a lower (beakless) articulation, and increased individual pod weight. Watering treatment had transitory and inconsistent effects on hardseededness. Seed production of Verano plants grown after flowering under shades with 30, 40 or 59 % transmission or no shade was reduced by low level of illuminance, mainly because of effects on floret number per inflorescence; the proportion of florets forming a lower articulation and individual pod weight (but not seed setting) was also reduced by shading. The seed moisture content at different harvest occasions appeared to influence hardseededness, but shading had no consistent effect...|$|R
