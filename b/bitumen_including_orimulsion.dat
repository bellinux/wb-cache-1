Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) has been applied to determine the concentration of trace elements in bitumen. This method requires irradiation of the material with neutrons that transform the elements into radioactive isotopes. By analyzing the activity of the individual nuclides, the concentration of each detectable trace element can be determined with high precision. In this work, we perform trace elemental analyses of 13 distinct <b>bitumens,</b> <b>including</b> 2 modified and 3 bitumens from the material library of Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP. Three elements, vanadium, nickel and cobalt are found to be present in all bitumens. Vanadium and nickel are found to be the most abundant among all the elements detected. Next to vanadium and nickel, significant concentrations of iron are found in 11 bitumens. The total number of trace elements identified varied from 17 to 28 for the bitumens studied. For modified bitumens, the concentration of trace elements is used as a parameter to measure the extent of modification. The sum of most abundant trace elements (vanadium and nickel) correlates well with the sulphur and asphaltene contents of the same bitumen. Moreover, the concentration of the latter metals are known to be an indicator for the aging characteristics of bitumen. Thus, INAA provides the content of trace elements in bitumen, where the concentrations vary (ppm to ppb) depending on the crude origin of the material. Thus, INAA can be used to trace back the crude origin of the material, which may have applications in the field of asphalt recycling (RAP and RAS) ...|$|R
3000|$|Bitumen has {{a complex}} {{chemical}} structure and {{is composed of}} compounds found in crude oil. Petroleum bitumen comprises {{a large number of}} different colloidal and suspended hydrocarbons. Carbon and hydrogen are the two main elements of bitumen, and their percentage by weight is 70 – 87 and 10 – 15 %, respectively. In addition to carbon and hydrogen, other elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, halogens and metals such as nickel, iron, cobalt and vanadium are found in bitumen. Crude oil can be fractionated into asphaltene and Malten. Malten is a group of petroleum aromatic compounds into which polar aromatic (resin) and saturated (paraffin) compounds are classified. The physical and chemical properties of bitumen are the determining factors for its use, and are affected by {{the quantity and quality of}} its ingredients and the process of refining hydrocarbons. Additives used to change the characteristics of asphalt, especially for concrete pavement, have lead to improved technical specifications. The first examples of asphalt sulfur were created in America and Canada in the mid-seventies (Bissada 1985). Increasing the sulfur content improves the properties of <b>bitumen,</b> <b>including</b> enhanced permeability, reduced viscosity and improved adhesion of the bitumen for aggregation, and has been used to produce asphalt concrete with higher mechanical resistance (Kandhal 1982). The pavement performance of sulfur-extended asphalt in different parts of the world indicates consistency of performance in most regions, equal to or better than that of conventional asphalt (Filippis 1998). Economic factors, such as increased lifespan and durability compared to conventional asphalt promote the use of asphalt after sulfur has been added, and increases savings due to energy expenditure by reducing the temperature necessary for the production of the asphalt mix (Miller 1981) and to make it resistant to oil-based solvents.|$|R

However, the physico-chemical characteristics of heavy oil and <b>bitumen</b> <b>include</b> high density, low distillates fraction, high viscosity, and high hetero-atom content which make extraction difficult and relatively expensive. The Toe-to-Heel Air Injection (THAI) and ‘add-on’ Catalytic upgrading process in situ (CAPRI) were specifically developed for the recovery and upgrading of heavy oil and bitumen. In this study, the effects of reaction gas media used in THAI–CAPRI were investigated, in particular the effects of using hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, and a blended gas mixture to simulate THAI combustion gases with Co–Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst at a reaction temperature of 425 °C, pressure 10 bar, and gas-to-oil ratio 50 mLmL− 1. Ex situ regeneration of the spent catalyst by thermal oxidation of the asphaltenes and coke deposits was also investigated. It was found that the average changes in API gravity of the produced oil were 4 ° using hydrogen, 3 ° with methane, 2. 9 ° with THAI gas, and 2. 7 ° with nitrogen above the value of 14 ° API gravity for the feed oil. The viscosity reduction and conversion of hydrocarbons with boiling point 343 °C+ into lower boiling distillable fractions followed the same trend as the API gravity. The percentage loss in specific surface areas as a result of coke deposition in the different reaction gases were as follows: 57. 2 % for hydrogen, 68 % for methane, and 96 % for nitrogen relative to the surface area of the fresh catalyst of 214. 4 m 2 g− 1. It was found that the spent catalyst contained 6 and 3 wt. % less coke after six hours operation when using hydrogen and methane reaction gases respectively compared to 23. 5 wt. % coke content in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Foamed bituminous materials {{have been used to}} a limited extent on a global scale before the early 1990 ’s when the lapse of the patent rights Mobil Oil Australia obtained in 1968 occurred. South Africa has also seen a number of projects involving foamed bituminous stabilisation being completed since 1994, with much success (Lewis, 1994). The design of foam mixes have not received as much attention as Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and the approaches used by the various users of the product have been secretive over the years due to the patent rights. To be more specific, over the past 10 years the HMA mix design approach has shifted from the Marshall mix design to methods that focus on investigating the fundamental material properties and relates test values to performance. Compaction of HMA {{has been the focus of}} many studies and the concept of using a standardised compaction effort for the design of different mixes have become obsolete. With the renaissance in the use of foam mixes, comes a need to establish sound compaction guidelines. Compaction methods used in the study were Marshall, Hugo, Kango, Superpave Gyratory compaction and a pedestrian roller. Marshall and Hugo compaction methods has have been used for a number of years in the design of HMA mixes in South Africa. The Kango hammer compaction method, involving the use of the Refusal Density equipment, was developed at the University of Nottingham (Brown et al, 1991).

A review of existing information and literature pertaining to changes in Australian paving-grade bitumen supply and the performance of bituminous surfaces is presented.

The lack of confidence in field performance of different batches or supplies of the same grade of bitumen is concerning.

The physical properties of the original bitumen, aged bitumen and rejuvenated bitumen were measured and compared by the conventional <b>bitumen</b> binder tests <b>including</b> softening point, penetration and Brookfield viscosity, and statistical analyses were used to assess the results. In general, the results showed that the aged bitumen was rejuvenated by the WCO due to a change in its physical properties, which resemble the physical properties of original bitumen (80 / 100). The optimum percentage of waste cooking oil for the rejuvenated aged bitumen group of 50 / 60, 40 / 50, and 30 / 40 was recognised by adding 1, 3 - 4, and 4 - 5 WCO, respectively.

40|$|Environment {{conservation}} and diminishing natural resources caused {{an increase in}} popularity of the application of renewable bio-origin resources {{for the construction of}} road pavement. Currently, there are known additions of bio-origin materials for bitumen modification. Such material is also used as a flux additive for bitumen or as a rejuvenator once working with reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). This paper presents research dealing with asphalt mixtures with RAP modified with a bio-agent of rapeseed origin. The main idea of the conducted research was to apply more RAP content directly to the batch mix plant without extra RAP heating. The RAP used in this study was milled from a base asphalt layer; the addition of RAP stiffens new asphalt mixtures. A bio-agent, due to its fluxing action, was used to support the asphalt mixing process and to decrease the over-stiffening of the mixture caused by RAP addition. This research <b>includes</b> <b>bitumen</b> and mixture tests. For the bitumen study, three different bitumens (35 / 50, 50 / 70, and 70 / 100) were tested in a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) for complex modulus G* and for phase angle |δ| in the temperature range 0 – 100 °C. The reference mixture and mixtures with 2. 5 % bio-agent were tested to assess the influence of RAP and the bio-agent addition on the asphalt mixture properties. Low temperature behavior (TSRST), stiffness, and fatigue resistance (4 PB) were tested. Based on the bitumen test, it was determined that even a low rate of bio-agent (2. 5 %) beneficially changes bitumen properties at a low temperature; moreover, polymerization processes occurring in the second stage of the process improves bitumen properties at a high operational temperature. The research with these asphalt mixtures demonstrates that the bio-origin flux acts as a rejuvenator and allows for an application of 30 % cold RAP. Thermal cracking resistance of the mixture with RAP and 2. 5 % bio-agent improved.

Near infrared spectroscopy were also utilized to study the ability of naphthenic acids and other amphiphiles to disintegrate asphaltene particles. It was shown that the structure of the naphthenic acids is important and that a commercial mixture of different surfactants had the best disintegration effect. The technique is applicable for screening the efficiency of various additives as disaggregation chemicals. Emulsion stability was studied by means of Langmuir technique, critical electric field and bottle tests. The Langmuir study showed that the presence of Ca 2 + -ions at elevated pH gave rise to stable naphthenate monolayers. Oil/water emulsions stabilized with different carboxylic acids were investigated at different pH-levels and water-contents. It was demonstrated that water/oil emulsions could be stabilized by a combination of multilayer (D-phase) and asphaltene particles. Critical electric field was used to determine the emulsion stability of these systems and it was shown that a combination of 60 % asphaltene particles and 40 % D-phase gave the stablest w/o-emulsions. This investigation verifies the importance of D-phase stabilization in combination with asphaltene particles in systems with acidic heavy crude oil (<b>including</b> <b>bitumen)</b> and water. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|Rheology {{involves}} {{the study and}} evaluation of the flow and permanent deformation of time-and temperature-dependent materials, such as bitumen, that are stressed {{through the application of}} a force. The fundamental rheological properties of bituminous materials <b>including</b> <b>bitumen</b> are normally measured using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), from low to high temperatures. DSR is a powerful tool to measure elastic, viscoelastic and viscous properties of binders over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies, provided the tests are conducted in the linear viscoelastic region. Therefore, the study of bitumen rheology is crucial since its reflects the overall performance of a flexible pavement. However, {{it is well known that}} the DSR also has limitations, where the measurements are exposed to compliance (testing) errors particularly at low temperatures and/or high frequencies. In addition, conducting laboratory tests are known to be laborious, time consuming and require skilled personnel. Therefore, this research is conducted to elucidate a better understanding of the rheological properties and modelling procedures of bitumens and bituminous binders. Various materials such as unmodified bitumens, polymer-modified bitumens (PMBs) and bitumen-filler mastics, unaged and aged samples, are used in this study. An extensive literature review was undertaken to identify reliable models that can be considered as a valuable alternative tool to describe or fit the rheological properties of bitumen. These properties are commonly presented in terms of complex modulus and phase angle master curves, together with the determination of shift factor values at a particular reference temperature. In general, the complex modulus and phase angle master curves can be modelled using different techniques; nomographs, mathematical equations and mechanical models. However, the nomographs have become obsolete in recent years and tended to be replaced by the two latter models. Those models are able to satisfactorily describe the rheological properties of unmodified bitumen. However, the observations suggest a lack of agreement between measured and predicted rheological properties for binders that contain a phase transition, such as found for highly crystalline bitumen, structured bitumen with high asphaltenes content and highly modified bitumen. An attempt was made to evaluate the validity of several mathematical equations and mechanical element approach using unaged and aged unmodified bitumens and PMBs database. It is observed that the Sigmoidal, Generalised Logistic Sigmoidal, Christensen and Anderson (CA), and Christensen, Anderson and Marasteanu (CAM) Models are able to satisfactorily describe the rheological properties of unmodified bitumens. Nevertheless, they suffer from the same drawbacks where the presence of highly EVA semi-crystalline and SBS elastomeric structures render breakdowns in the complex modulus master curves. Similar discrepancies are observed when one of the mechanical models (the 2 S 2 P 1 D Model) is used. To construct the master curves, different shifting methods are available. It is found that a numerical shift produced the best fit between measured and modelled data, followed by the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussées (LCPC) approach, William, Landel and Ferry (WLF), Modified Kaelble, Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility (VTS), Arrhenius and Log-Linear methods. A temperature range from 10 to 75 oC is used in this study. It is worth mentioning that most of the methods are empirical and might not be applicable for all materials. Finally, the phase angle master curves must also not be neglected to yield a complete rheological properties of binders. The statistical analysis between measured and modelled data shows that the Fractional Model yielded the best correlation for a temperature range from 10 to 75 oC, followed by the Al-Qadi and Co-workers, CAM, CA and Kramers-Kronig relationships. An anomaly is observed between measured and descriptive data of the Kramers-Kronig relationship particularly at high frequencies and/or low temperatures. The Fractional Model is not considered suitable for practical purposes due to the high number of coefficients that need to be solved...|$|R
40|$|Thin surfacings {{are widely}} used as surface layers to provide {{additional}} functions and to extend the service life of existing pavements. They can protect the treated road surfaces from external aggressive substances, the degeneration process of weather and the ageing caused by Ultraviolet light and oxygen. Antiskid surfacing is one type of thin surfacings. It refers to road surface treatment which includes high-friction aggregates and an adhesive binder to bond the aggregates to the road surface. Antiskid surfacing {{is designed to provide}} skid resistance, which means excellent adhesion property is then necessary for binding the aggregates together on the surface. So binders with high adhesion strength with aggregates are strongly required. In the Netherlands, most of the airfield runways used tar-containing binders for the antiskid surfacings. Unlike bitumen based materials, tar-containing surface layers, because of the unique chemical and molecular structure of refined tar, are inherently resistant to chemicals and can provide better adhesive property. However, tar-containing binder is toxic and carcinogenic because of its high Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) content. It cannot meet the Dutch environmental standards and hence will not be allowed for antiskid surfacing on the runways. Therefore, alternatives to tar-containing binders are urgently required. Research on this topic has been being under investigation for a number of years. This research mainly focuses on the definition of requirements for the alternatives, together with a design approach on thin surfacings. Firstly, specimens with tar-containing antiskid layers on the surface were collected from six airfields’ runways. Fourier Transform Infrared, surface characteristics, tensile adhesion and shear adhesion at the interface were investigated. The tar-containing antiskid layers have a minimum 1. 26 mm of texture depth and can keep this texture depth for a long service life. The improved pull test and shear test methods are suitable for evaluating the adhesive properties between thin antiskid surface layer and underlying asphalt mixture layer. The shear strength at the interface between tar-containing antiskid layer and underlying asphalt mixture layer is higher than the value at the interface between asphalt mixture layers. The conclusions from these test results are used as benchmarks for alternative antiskid surfacings. Secondly, newly designed binders, which are considered as potential binders for antiskid surfacings, were researched. Copolymer modified bitumen emulsion (MBE), 2 -component Modified Epoxy Resin (MER) and 2 -component Epoxy Modified <b>Bitumen</b> (EMB) were <b>included.</b> The curing behavior, direct tensile strength, high temperature resistance, weather resistance and low temperature relaxation properties were studied by means of Direct Tensile Test, oven ageing and weatherometer ageing, Dynamic Shear Rheometer test, Dynamic Mechanic Thermal Analysis and Relaxation test. Test results indicate that the investigated 2 -component epoxy modified bitumen can be designed as a suitable binder for antiskid surfacing, with good high temperature resistance, qualified relaxation behavior, sufficient tensile strength and enough failure strain. Thirdly, one of the researched 2 -component epoxy modified bitumen was then used to design antiskid surfacing in the lab. The surface characteristics, resistance to tensile stress and shear stress were then investigated. Noise-reducing thin surface layers were also included in this research. The results show that EMB based antiskid layer can provide better adhesion at the interface than tar-containing antiskid layer and polymer modified bitumen based antiskid layers. Fourthly, the Finite Element Models of antiskid surfacing were developed to simulate the loading condition in the antiskid surface layers. The viscoelastic properties of EMB and MBE were used as input. The calculation shows that the antiskid structure has huge influence on the resulting binder behaviors. The stresses generated in the EMB binder are slightly higher than in the MBE binder, while the MBE is subjected to much higher maximum principal strain and shear strain levels. Furthermore, the EMB binder has better ability to recover after loading. The aggregate skeleton has a higher influence on the stresses and strains in the soft MBE binder than on the stresses and strains in the EMB binder. At the end, some recommendations are given for further research. Trial sections in the field and fuel resistance are suggested. Fatigue property and failure mechanics are also recommended to investigate the damage mechanisms with FEM model. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{infrastructures}} such as {{roads are}} assets {{for the society}} as they not only ensure mobility but also strengthen society’s economy. Considerable amount of energy and materials, that <b>include</b> <b>bitumen,</b> aggregates and asphalt, are required to build and maintain roads. Improper utilization of energy and/or use of materials may lead to more waste and higher costs. The {{impact on the environment}} cannot be neglected either. Life cycle assessment (LCA) as a method can be used to assess the environmental impacts of a road system over its entire life time. Studying the life cycle perspective of roads can help us improve the technology in order to achieve a system that has a lower impact on the environment. There are number of LCA tools available. However, implementation of such tools is still unseen in real road projects. This clearly indicates that there are gaps which are needed to be filled in order to bring these tools into practice. An open road LCA framework was developed for the asphalt roads in order to help in decision support at the late project planning stage such as that related to the green procurement. The framework takes into account the construction, maintenance and end of life phases and focuses on energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Threshold values for the production of some additives were also determined to show how LCA tools can help material suppliers to improve the road materials production processes and the road authorities to set limits on the use of different materials based on the environmental criteria. Additive consideration and feedstock energy in road LCAs were also identified as gaps that were looked in detail. The attributes that are important to consider in an asphalt road LCA that seeks to serve as a decision support in a procurement situation are described. A brief literature review was carried out that focused on project LCAs, and specifically those considering pavements, as this level is assumed to be appropriate for questions relevant in a procurement situation. Following the different standards; road LCAs developed all over the world have generated a lot of knowledge and the studies have been different from each other such as in terms of goals and system boundaries. Hence, the patterns observed have been very different from study to study. It was also difficult to assess the decision support level for which the various LCA frameworks or tools were developed. It is important to define system boundaries based on where in the system the decision support is needed. For LCA to be useful for decision support in a procurement situation, {{it is important to have}} a clear understanding of the attributes that constitute the life cycle phases and how data of high quality for them are obtained. The level of consistency and transparency of road LCAs becomes increasingly important in pre-procurement and procurement situations. The key attributes used in a road LCA should mirror the material properties used in a pavement design and therefore be closely linked to the performance of the road in its life cycle. From the different case studies, it was found that asphalt production and transportation of materials are usually highest in the energy and GHG emissions chain. It is highly favorable to have the quarry site, the asphalt plant and the construction site not far from each other and to use the electricity that has been produced in an efficient way. Based on the laboratory test results, it is shown that the effects of chemical warm mix asphalt additives (WMAA) s must be evaluated on a case by case basis since WMAA interaction with the aggregate surface mineralogy appears to play a significant role and thus affects its long term structural behavior. Using the material properties obtained from the Superpave indirect tensile test (IDT) results, pavement thickness design was done in which Arlanda aggregate based asphalt mixtures resulted in thinner pavements as compared to Skärlunda aggregate based asphalt mixtures for the same design life period. Energy (feedstock and expended) saving and reduction in GHG emissions were also seen with addition of WMAA, for both aggregate type cases, based on the data used. Importantly, the results presented illustrate the importance of a systems based LCA approach for evaluating the sustainability for different design and construction options. In this context, having actual pavement material properties as the key attributes in the LCA enables a pavement focused assessment of environmental costs associated with different design options.

40|$|Canada has {{the second}} largest proven oil {{reserves}} next to Saudi Arabia which is mostly located in Alberta and Saskatchewan but is unconventional heavy oil and bitumen. The tar sands are found at the surface and are mined, yet 80 % of the 173 billion barrels of heavy oil and bitumen exist in-situ according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). Two factors inhibit the economic extraction and processing of Canadian heavy oil; its enormous viscosity ranging from 1000 to over 1 million mPa. s and the asphaltene content (high molecular weight molecules containing heavy metals and sulphur). Heavy oil and <b>bitumen</b> were only <b>included</b> in the reserves estimates {{through the efforts of}} Canadian enhanced oil recovery (EOR) research. Viscosity reduction is the one common element of in-situ methods of heavy oil recovery with the exception of cold production. Currently, steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) are being used commercially in the field where the oil’s viscosity is reduced by injecting steam. Thermal methods are energy intensive requiring vast volumes of water such that any improvement would be beneficial. Solvent extraction is one alternative requiring no water, the solvent is recoverable and reusable, and depending on the mode of operation the heavy oil is upgraded in-situ. Vapour Extraction (VAPEX) and enhanced solvent extraction (N-SolvTM) are two such methods. VAPEX and N-Solv reduce the bitumen’s viscosity via mass transfer and a combination of mass and heat transfer, respectively. A light hydrocarbon solvent (instead of steam) is injected into an upper horizontal well where the solvent mixes with the heavy oil, reduces its viscosity and allows the oil to drain under gravity to a bottom production well. The idea of using solvents for heavy oil extraction has been around since the 1970 s and both VAPEX and N-Solv are patented processes. However, there is still much to be learned about how these processes physically work. Research to date has focused on varying system parameters (including model dimensions, permeability, heavy oil viscosity, solvent type and injection rate, etc.) to observe the effect on oil production from laboratory scale models. Based on an early mass balance model by Butler and Mokrys (1989) and an improvement by Das (1995), molecular diffusion alone cannot account for the produced oil rates observed from laboratory models. Until recently, very little progress had been made towards qualifying and quantifying the mass transfer mechanisms {{with the exception of the}} diffusivity of light hydrocarbons in heavy oil. Mass transfer can only be by diffusion and convection. Differentiating and quantifying the contribution of each is complex due to the nature and viscosity of the oil. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the mass transfer mechanisms during the solvent recovery of heavy oil. Quantifying the diffusion of light hydrocarbon solvents has been an active topic of research with limited success since the mid 1990 ’s. The experimental approach presented here focused on capturing the rate of solvent mass transfer into the bitumen by measuring the bitumen swelling and the butane uptake independently. Unlike early pressure decay methods, the pressure is held constant to not violate the assumed equilibrium solvent concentration at the interfacial boundary condition. The high solubility of solvent in heavy oil complicates the physical modeling because simplifying assumptions of a constant diffusion coefficient, constant density and a quiescent liquid should not be used. The model was developed from first principles to predict the bitumen swelling. The form of the concentration dependent diffusivity was assumed and the diffusivity coefficients initially guessed. The swelling (moving boundary) was fixed by defining a new dimensionless space coordinate and the set of partial differential equations solved using the method of lines. Using the non-linear regression (lsqnonlin) function in MATLAB®, optimising for the difference in predicted and experimentally found bitumen heights and independently validating the result using the solvent uptake, the diffusivity of butane in heavy oil (at 25 oC) was found to be Dsb = 4. 78 x 10 - 6 ωs + 4. 91 x 10 - 6 cm 2 /s where ωs is the solvent mass fraction. Diffusion alone has proven inadequate in predicting oil recovery rates from laboratory scale models. It is logical to assume that convective mass transfer plays a role at mixing the solvent and bitumen while draining via gravity through the reservoir porous matrix. Solvent extraction experiments were conducted in etched glass micromodels to observe the pore scale phenomena. The pore scale mechanisms were found to differ depending on how the solvent extraction was operated, with non-condensing (VAPEX) or condensing (N-SolvTM) solvent. Observations show increased convective mixing and an increased rate of interface advancement when the solvent condenses on the bitumen surface. Evidence of trapped butane vapour being mobilised with the draining live oil and a technique of observing solvent extraction using UV light confirm that the draining live oil is on average one pore deep. While the interface appears from a distance to be uniform, at the pore scale it is not. Live oil can drain from one to two pores via capillary displacement mechanisms in one section of the interface and via film flow only in another area (James and Chatzis 2004; James et al. 2008). This work also shows the detrimental impact of having a non-condensable gas present during solvent extraction (James and Chatzis 2008). In summary, this work emphasises the mass transfer and drainage displacement mechanisms of non-condensing (VAPEX) and condensing (N-Solv) solvent extraction methods of heavy oil recovery...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt has an {{important}} share in the road construction {{as it is the}} major material used to build roads. Roads are assets to the society and an integral component {{in the development of a}} nation’s infrastructure. The production of asphalt and the different phases it goes through before it becomes a road have a massive impact on the environment. For the asphalt production bitumen binder is used. Bitumen is a complex mixture of organic compounds, primarily composed of high boiling point and high molecular weight hydrocarbons, whose molecules are combinations of the familiar petroleum structural building units. Its physical behavior can be explained by considering it a colloidal system whose properties are influenced by the interactions of various empirically defined generic compound classes. Bitumen overall composition depends on the composition of the crude petroleum oil from which it is obtained, as well as the techniques used to refine and process it. Bitumens are used to form produce for many applications, including the use of hot-mix, warm mix, reclaimed asphalt mixing in road construction and maintenance. At ambient temperatures bitumen is a stable, semi-solid substance and does not present any health risks. In road construction industry during manufacturing, storage, transportation and use bitumen is heated giving off hydrocarbon emissions, to which workers may be exposed. Bitumen emissions are complex and variable mixtures of inorganic particulate and organic compounds that include aliphatics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. In recent years there has been increasing interest in investigating the potential of bitumen emissions to cause health effects in exposed workers. Bitumen remains a focus for health effects research however, primarily due to the presence of small amounts of PAHs in the product and uncertainty about the associated health risks from exposure to emissions from hot bitumen. The bitumen industry is working closely with regulatory and scientific bodies to resolve remaining questions. Further studies are in progress, employing state of the art techniques, as Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), which should resolve finally the question whether exposure to bitumen emissions presents a cancer risk. In addition to the health effects research discussed has been active in promoting strategies to reduce worker exposure to emissions from hot bitumen work. Warm-mix asphalts are produced and placed at temperatures typically 10 - 40 °C lower that conventional rolled asphalt. With the decreased production temperature comes the additional benefit of reduced emissions from burning fuels, fumes, and odors generated at the plant and the paving site. Disadvantages of WMA are elevate costs and it is only about 3 to 8 years (depending on method) since the earliest WMA field tests were started and therefore its long-term performance is still unproven. Workers in road construction industry include asphalt plant workers, ground construction workers and road paving workers. These individuals can be exposed to a wide range of potentially hazardous substances emitted from hot bitumen. Modern road paving workers are typically exposed to 0. 1 to 2 mg/m 3 of <b>bitumen</b> fume which <b>includes</b> 10 to 200 ng/m 3 of benzo(a) pyrene. Information on determinants of other exposures in road construction is either absent or limited. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) historical cohort study of asphalt industry since 1993, evaluated in 2011 bitumen emissions as possible carcinogenic to humans during road paving. Bitumen fume exposures during asphalt plants or outdoor hot mix paving and surface dressing can be expected to be similar. This comparison can be confounded by presence on organic matter of non-bitumen origin. Exposure to PAH can be anticipated to be elevated, when coal tar is added to paving mixtures. There is also some evidence that the exposures have been higher in the past. However, misclassification of exposure in such grouping can be expected to be substantial and its magnitude and direction would be impossible to quantify. Assembling industrial hygiene measurements from various studies into a single database and obtaining access to unpublished data may help refine exposure assessment in road construction industry. Very little information is available regarding environmental exposure to asphalt emissions. Results from direct human exposure monitoring indicate that the physical character of asphalt emissions released to the atmosphere during paving operations is composed of mineral particulate matter and hydrocarbons, including higher molecular weight PAHs. Estimates of total atmospheric PAH emissions suggest that the contributions from the paving industry are very small. The PAHs that are released will primarily adsorb to airborne particulate matter. Some of these PAHs will be deposited in a few days, while some may remain in the atmosphere for several weeks. No information is available concerning the deposition of airborne asphalt emissions onto land. Various methods are used to monitor bitumen-derived vapors, aerosols and fumes from heated bitumen. The more conventional methods are Total Particulate Matter (TPM) or solvent soluble/organic particulate matter (e. g., Benzene-Soluble Matter (BSM)). Recently more often the amount of total organic matter (TOM) in both aerosol and vapor is determined. Different official methods for PAH analysis in bitumen fumes have been propose. Due to the existence of numerous structural isomers of the PAHs, chromatographic separation either by Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled with universal Flame Ionization Detection (FID), Mass Spectrometry (MS) or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with ultraviolet or Fluorescence Detection (FD) is generally employed for isomer-specific identification and quantification. At present, no international standard for the assessment of exposure to bitumen fume exists. As a result, reported values of exposures over time, between studies within the same country, and between the various countries vary significantly and must be considered carefully as to the intended use. In order to personal study of bitumen emissions, a special fume generation system has been developed to identify the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic compounds, emitted from different types of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) regarding two temperature regimes 300 °C and 500 °C. The ten types of heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and seventeen types of PAHs were identified and analyzed in this experiment. This study shows that increasing temperature leads to an increase of PAHs and heterocyclic aromatic compound emissions. Regarding the assessment of bitumen emissions as possible indicator of carcinogenic exposure, bitumen fumes generated at high temperatures (for 500 °C in our experiment) are more likely to generate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carcinogenic PAHs, Heterocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons than fumes generated at lower temperatures (for 300 °C in our experiment). However, from our results we can note that low temperature produces low emissions, but with higher percent of carcinogenic PAHs and benzene emissions of total emissions. This result seems quite surprising for us. The obtained results of Relative Carcinogenic Factor (RCF) show that decreasing of temperature leads to a decrease of RCF. Several studies have dealt with fumes from bitumen emissions, there was report that chemical composition of bitumen fumes varies and depends on crude petroleum sources, type of asphalt, temperature and mixing during the manufacturing process, unfortunately, we do not know the composition of RAP in this experiment, in that case we cannot give more well interpretation of fumes emitted from bitumen. We can just highlight that the temperature of heated bitumen is the key parameter in order to control the emission, and low temperature reduces the possible carcinogenic effect of heated bitumen. This study would be helpful to monitor health impacts of workers involved in road construction industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of environmental media by total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) {{is a concern}} {{in many parts of}} the world; particularly as most petroleum components like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are either toxic or carcinogens. In South Africa, the sale of major petroleum products by the South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA) reveals that about 21 billion litres of petroleum products are sold per year. These products <b>include</b> <b>bitumen,</b> diesel, fuel oil, illum paraffin, jet fuel and petrol. In addition, 19. 5 million tonnes of crude oil are brought into South Africa annually to feed the country’s four refineries. The production of oily sludges at refineries, transportation, storage, and handling of petroleum products by end users, results in environmental contamination. The soil environment is particularly vulnerable to hydrocarbon contamination as most of the accidental spillages by trucks, rail locomotives and pipelines have a direct impact on the soil medium. As most of the petroleum compounds are either toxic or carcinogenic, their removal from the soil is necessary. The literature reveals that biological treatment of hydrocarbons is cost effective compared to other treatment options. However, in order to improve the efficiency of biological treatments, there is a need to understand the microbial diversity of TPH stressed environments and how simple biomonitoring ‘instruments’ can be used to evaluate the removal of hydrocarbons from the soil. The message from the literature indicates some potential solutions to the existing problems associated with soil microbial diversity and biotreatment of hydrocarbon contaminated soil, which must be investigated. The main aim of this work was to evaluate the microbial diversity of the different soil environments disturbed by Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) and the potential use of plants and microorganisms in monitoring and removing hydrocarbons from the soil. In addition, the potential of the culture-independent methods in complementing, the culture-dependent methods when evaluating soil microbial diversity were also evaluated. The polyphasic approach was successfully used in evaluating microbial diversity in both hydrocarbon-contaminated and uncontaminated soils. The approach involved the use of community level physiological profiles (CLPP) and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) to evaluate the effects of hydrocarbons on the soil microbial communities of both the contaminated and non-contaminated soil layers at a diesel contaminated site. Because of the ability of the molecular methods (PCR-DGGE) to complement the CLPP, the polyphasic approach is recommended when evaluating soil microbial diversity and the effect of pollutants on microbial community structure as the approach appears to compensate for the limitations of each of the methods of evaluating microbial diversity. However, further work is needed to improve the recovery of bacteria from the soil, particularly where the interest is to evaluate the availability of the indigenous microbial populations for bioremediation. The substrate utilisation pattern and 16 S DNA fragments of the soil microbial communites in different soil layers at a diesel contaminated site were different. The substrate utilisation pattern of the topsoil was different from the substrate utilisation pattern of the soil layers below 1 m. In addition, the substrate utilisation pattern of the contaminated and uncontaminated soil layers were different. 16 S DNA fragments of the different soil layers were also different. While the metabolic activities of different samples as reflected by CLPP does not necessarily imply the difference in community structure of the samples, PCR-DGGE revealed differences in 16 S DNA fragments and this complemented the results of the culture based methods. The results suggest that the use of functional and genetic approaches (in combination) have a better chance of revealing a ‘clearer’ picture of soil microbial diversity. The distribution of hydrocarbon-utilising bacteria and the efficiency of biodegradation of hydrocarbons vary with soil depth. The biodegradation rate of hydrocarbon was highest in the topsoil compared to other soil layers and this was supported by the high number of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the topsoil compared to soil layers at and below 1 m. The results suggest that the biological removal of hydrocarbons varies in different soil layers and that microbial diversity as measured by CLPP and PCR-DGGE varies with depth in hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. The information about metabolic activities of different soil layers is important when assessing the footprints of degradation processes during monitored natural attenuation (MNA). However, further studies are required to understand the effect of (not only) other pollutants, but the influence of soil components (pore volume, level of adsorbents and other environmental factors) on the microbial diversity of different soil layers in both ‘shallow’ and deep aquifers. The microbial diversity of different environments contaminated by hydrocarbons has different community level physiological profiles. At diesel depots where similar hydrocarbons are used for maintenance of locomotives, the number of bacteria (both total culturable heterotrophic bacteria and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria) was proportional to the level of hydrocarbon contamination. However, there was no significant difference in the level of total culturable heterotrophs (TCHs) and the hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. In addition, the biological activities as evaluated by CO 2 production were higher in nutrient amended treatments in which high numbers of TCHs were present. Microbial diversity of polluted surfaces needs to be studied further to investigate the concentration or the thickness of the hydrocarbons layer on the rock surfaces that encourages the attachment or colonization of the TCHs and the hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The hydrocarbons rather than the geographical origin of the soil sample appear to be more important in determining functional or species diversity within the bacterial communities. The samples from different locations were as different as samples from the same location but from contaminated versus uncontaminated soil. The results of the soils from different locations artificially contaminated by different hydrocarbons also reached the same conclusion. However, further work is required to investigate the importance of soil heterogeneity in community studies of soil environments contaminated by similar hydrocarbons. The removal of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in multi-planted soil microcosm was higher compared to PAHs removal in monoculture soil microcosms. In addition, the PAH removal was higher in the vegetated soil microcosms compared to the non-vegetated microcosms. There was however, no significant difference in the PAH removal in the soil microcosms planted with Branchiaria serrata and the microcosm with Eulisine corocana. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster analysis used to analyse the functional diversity of the different treatments revealed differences in the metabolic fingerprints of the PAH contaminated and non-contaminated soils. However the differences in metabolic diversity between the multi-planted and mono-planted treatments were not clearly revealed. The results suggest that multi-plant rhizoremediation using tolerant plant species rather than monoculture rhizoremediation have the potential to enhance pollutant removal in moderately contaminated soils. Lepidium sativum, a plant with short germination period, was successfully used to monitor, the removal of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the soil. The sensitivity of L. sativum eased with increasing concentration of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the artificially contaminated soil while no germination occurred in the historically polluted soil. When used during phytoremediation of PAH, the germination level of L. sativum was inhibited during the first weeks, after which germination increased, possibly due to PAH dissipation from the soil. The methodology based on the sensitivity of L. sativum to PAH can be used as a monitoring tool in bioremediation of soil contaminated with PAH. However, the methodology should be developed further to gain more knowledge on aspects of bioavailability of PAH in both the aged as well as the freshly spiked soil. Also critical is the sensitivity of the seeds to other pollutants (e. g. heavy metals), which are most likely to occur in the presence of the PAHs. Although the biological activities have the potential to monitor the removal of hydrocarbons from the soil, the methodologies have not been developed sufficiently to cater for the heterogeneity of the soil and to differentiate toxicity by the parent compound and the metabolites. At present, it is best that they be used to complement existing conventional monitoring instruments. Finally, the biological removal of hydrocarbons is cost-effective compared to other treatments. However, inherent physical, chemical and biological limitation hampers the efficient utilisation of the bioremediation technologies. Biostimulation approaches involving the stimulation of indigenous pollutant-degrading bacteria should be preferred ahead of bioaugumentation. The latter approach should be considered when the contaminated site does not have the indigenous pollutant-degrading bacteria. Even in this case, the aim should be to ‘seed’ the biodegradation knowledge to the indigenous microbial populations due to poor survival of the added strains.
