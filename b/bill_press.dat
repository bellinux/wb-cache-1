5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised {{his analysis of the}} decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's <b>Bill</b> <b>Press</b> interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E

25|$|TV {{and video}} {{simulcasts}} {{of the show}} have been available since last 2010. From November 2010 until late 2013, Ustream broadcast a video feed of the show. The show was also formerly simulcast on Current TV from March 26, 2012 until August 15, 2013, when live programming on Current ended in preparation of the transition of Current TV to Al Jazeera America. On Current TV, Talking Liberally: The Stephanie Miller Show {{was part of a}} morning block with The <b>Bill</b> <b>Press</b> Show. After leaving Current, the show moved to Free Speech TV, where a video simulcast has aired since January 6, 2014, after a successful Indiegogo campaign by both Miller and Free Speech to raise the money needed to buy equipment and produce the TV side of the show for Free Speech TV. The previous morning block with The <b>Bill</b> <b>Press</b> Show has been reunited on Free Speech TV, although Free Speech only airs the second hour of Press's show.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, [...] "The Mic" [...] made a {{schedule}} change that {{was greeted with}} more controversy, replacing Thom Hartmann's afternoon program with The Dave Ramsey Show, a program that is more known for financial advice and at times displays a conservative viewpoint. [...] Though station management said the move was intended to broaden the station's listenership and {{not to make a}} wholesale change in political ideology, complaints from listeners and a few advertisers prompted WXXM to return Hartmann's show to the 2-5PM slot, while moving Ramsey's show to the 5-8AM slot in place of Lee Rayburn (Rayburn left the station by his own choosing earlier in the month, in part due to the direction he felt the station was taking by adding Ramsey's show). [...] The Dave Ramsey Show would have a short stay on [...] "The Mic," [...] with the syndicated <b>Bill</b> <b>Press</b> Show replacing it one month after its debut on WXXM (Ramsey would later move to WIBA's late night schedule).|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, liberal {{radio host}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Press,</b> who {{attended}} the rally personally, criticized the [...] "Christian religious fervor" [...] of the event, remarking {{that at one point}} he expected Beck [...] "to part the Reflecting Pool and walk across it." [...] In discussing the setting among the crowd, Press stated that it was [...] "a strange combination of political rally and religious revival", which left him surrounded by the [...] "old, white, and angry." [...] Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean questioned Beck's mental sanity, while referring to Beck's audience as [...] "lost souls" [...] {{in the middle of an}} economic downturn who then follow the [...] "racist" [...] and [...] "hatemonger" [...] Beck, whom Dean compared to Father Coughlin from the 1930s. Author Christopher Hitchens in Slate magazine, critiqued the rally as a [...] "large, vague, moist, and undirected Waterworld of white self-pity", discerning that the spectacle was a consequence of the white American subconscious feeling anxiety mixed with nostalgia, at the uneasy realization that soon they will no longer be the majority. In Hitchens' view, the expressions of [...] "pathos and insecurity", were voiced in a [...] "sickly", [...] "pious" [...] and [...] "persecuted" [...] tone, while the speeches [...] "denied racial feeling so monotonously and vehemently as to draw attention." [...] The Huffington Post compiled a slideshow of what they believed were [...] "the most ridiculous messages" [...] from Beck's rally, while Eric Deggans, media critic for the St. Petersburg Times, hypothesized that with the rally, Beck had created a blueprint for [...] "ultra-conservative" [...] Tea Party activists to look more mainstream to independent voters before the November 2010 midterm elections.|$|E
