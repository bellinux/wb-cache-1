5|$|Finally {{reaching}} Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie {{confront the}} witch {{and her sisters}} in a trivia quiz show named the Tower of Tragedy Quiz in which losing competitors will be flattened under one-tonne weights. Mingella and Blobbelda lose to <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie enter {{the top of the}} fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the Hag 1 along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to Cauldron Keep and play a game of hacky-sack with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Mainer and {{his wife}} settled in Flint, Michigan, where he found work at a General Motors factory. Although renouncing both the music {{industry}} and his trademark instrument, the <b>banjo,</b> he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings. In the early 1960s, Molly O'Day convinced {{him that he could}} use the <b>banjo</b> in gospel recordings, which spurred a series of religiously themed <b>banjo</b> albums beginning in 1961. He also began to record and tour with his wife.|$|E
5|$|L.O.G. {{transports}} {{the characters}} to his headquarters in Showdown Town and starts the contest. The prize is ownership of Spiral Mountain, while the loser must endure eternal hardship at L.O.G.'s video game factory. As <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie seek {{to win by}} completing the challenges, Gruntilda uses her powers and abilities {{to try to stop}} the duo, with a cat named Piddles and an army of robots assisting her. The game ends with Gruntilda and <b>Banjo</b> participating in a final duel in Spiral Mountain. <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie destroy all of Gruntilda's vehicles and prepare to fight back as she gets back up, but L.O.G. declares <b>Banjo</b> the winner. After L.O.G. sends Gruntilda off to work at his video game factory, he rewards <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie by giving them the deeds to Spiral Mountain and restoring their moves, while Banjo's friends reveal that they have rebuilt his house after its destruction in Banjo-Tooie. Meanwhile, Gruntilda declares that bringing her to the factory was a mistake and vows that she will make her own video game.|$|E

25|$|While five-string <b>banjos</b> are {{traditionally}} played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves, tenor <b>banjos</b> and plectrum <b>banjos</b> are {{played with a}} pick, either to strum full chords or, most commonly in Irish Traditional Music, play single note melodies.|$|R
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of <b>Banjo,</b> a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes <b>Banjo</b> up and the two set out to rescue her. <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then {{figure out a way to}} help them. It is also possible to increase <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E
5|$|Musical notes {{return in}} Banjo-Tooie, but are now used {{to learn new}} moves from Bottles' brother, the drill {{sergeant}} Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie's moves from the first game are immediately accessible in Banjo-Tooie, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, {{and the ability to}} play as <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.|$|E

5|$|Banjo-Kazooie is a {{platform}} video game developed by Rare and originally released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 1998. It {{is the first}} game in the Banjo-Kazooie series and follows {{the story of a}} bear, <b>Banjo,</b> and a bird, Kazooie, as they try to stop the plans of the witch Gruntilda, who intends to switch her beauty with Banjo's sister, Tooty. The game features nine nonlinear levels where the player must use <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie's wide range of abilities to gather jigsaw pieces. It features challenges like solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, collecting items, and defeating opponents.|$|E
5|$|Ghosts Iâ€“IV {{features}} a wide assortment of musical instruments, including piano, guitar, bass, synthesizer, marimba, tambourine, <b>banjo,</b> dulcimer, and xylophone, {{many of which}} were sampled and distorted electronically. Percussion instruments, contributed primarily by Brian Viglione, were constructed largely out of found objects and household items.|$|E

5|$|Mainer grew up {{listening}} to traditional mountain music and was largely influenced by his brother-in-law Roscoe Banks. He first learned to play the <b>banjo</b> at square dances, where he would pick up instruments left by performers and practice on them. After moving to Concord, North Carolina and working in a series of jobs at cotton mills, he became a part of his brother J.E.'s band, known as J. E. Mainer's Mountaineers. His entry into the band in 1934 marked the beginning of a nearly six-decade career in music. J.E. played the fiddle while Wade performed on the <b>banjo</b> for the string band, and they played at fiddlers' conventions and other gatherings.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels like Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern Barbadian calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humor, and opinionated lyrics that continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or <b>banjo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rare then {{developed}} Diddy Kong Racing, {{their first}} self-published game. Originally {{intended as a}} real-time strategy game involving cavemen, the game was re-imagined into a racing game prior to its release in 1997. It {{was one of the}} fastest selling games at the time, as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records. Diddy Kong Racing also features protagonists from some future Rare games, including <b>Banjo</b> and Conker. At the time, Rare was still working on the large-scale platform game. Originally codenamed , it was a game featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates. The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as <b>Banjo,</b> and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird. The two characters were inspired by characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience. Banjo-Kazooie was released in June 1998 to critical acclaim. A sequel, <b>Banjo</b> Tooie, was released in 2000. It was a critical success and it outsold the first game, selling 3 million copies.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>banjos</b> are {{typically}} strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string is wound with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their <b>banjos</b> with nylon or gut strings {{to achieve a}} more mellow, old-time tone.|$|R
50|$|Worm drives {{are used}} as the tuning {{mechanism}} for many musical instruments, including guitars, double-basses, mandolins, bouzoukis, and many <b>banjos</b> (although most high-end <b>banjos</b> use planetary gears or friction pegs). A worm drive tuning device is called a machine head.|$|R
5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children {{who arrived in}} the Spanish village of <b>Banjos</b> in 1887. Many details of the story very closely resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of <b>Banjos</b> who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly {{as there is no}} record of any Spanish village called <b>Banjos.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} Late As Usual {{band members}} included Moritz Behm on fiddle, Neil Burnett on vocals, penny whistle & celtic harp, Glenn Kruger (the Stoaters, Real McKenzies) on drums & vocals, and Cam Salay on <b>banjo</b> and bass. In 1995, {{the band was}} later joined by Shona Le MottÃ©e on fiddle, and Shannon Saunders {{on a variety of}} instruments (bass, fiddle, <b>banjo),</b> to contribute to the band's live shows. Le MottÃ©e left The Paperboys in 1997, after recording the award-winning Molinos, and was replaced by flautist Hanz Araki. In the late 1990s, they were joined for a time by keyboardist Doug Schmidt.|$|E
5|$|The thornback {{guitarfish}} was scientifically {{described by}} American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in an 1880 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum. They assigned it to the genus Platyrhina, and named it triseriata from the Latin tres ("three") and series ("row"), {{in reference to the}} three rows of thorns on its back. One year later in the same journal, Samuel Garman placed this species in a newly created genus, Platyrhinoidis. The type specimen is an adult male caught off Santa Barbara on February 8, 1880. Other common names for this species include <b>banjo</b> shark (not {{to be confused with the}} Australian <b>banjo</b> sharks, Trygonorrhina), California thornback, guitarfish, round skate, shovelnose, thornback, and thornback ray.|$|E

5|$|Two years {{following}} Gruntilda's first defeat by <b>Banjo</b> and Kazooie, {{the two are}} playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1, and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. <b>Banjo,</b> Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down {{and put an end}} to her plans.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} <b>banjo,</b> as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the <b>banjo).</b> They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future â€” like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two yearsâ€”which could have earned him enough money to buy a houseâ€”but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
