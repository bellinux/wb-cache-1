40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} ballast quality evaluation computer model based on the relations among the ballast particle characteristics and <b>ballast</b> <b>performance.</b> ^ Much effort has been given in the past to seek suitable criteria for ballast material selection considering <b>ballast</b> <b>performance</b> and maintenance costs. But the selection of ballast material has appeared to be based on limited information without full regard to the effect of ballast particle characteristics on the ability of ballast to fulfill its functions in track. This will result in some misjudgments in the ballast material selection. ^ The developed model can quantify the ballast suitability with a ballast quality index which has taken the basic ballast particle characteristics and the main ballast field functions into consideration. The basic ballast particle characteristics included are shape, angularity, surface texture, gradation, and specific gravity. The main ballast field functions for track are providing resistance forces, resiliency, void storage, drainage, and facilitating maintenance. The ballast particle characteristics are numerically related to the ballast field functions based on available data from field and laboratory tests on granular materials and some assumptions. Weighting factors are used to represent the relative importance of the basic ballast particle characteristics to each ballast function and then the relative importance of the main ballast functions to the overall ballast field performance. ^ The developed model is evaluated using the ballast field data related to the track performance. The verification results show that the developed ballast quality index can reflect the ballast quality. ...|$|E
40|$|Grading {{has long}} been {{recognised}} to critically influence the mechanical behaviour of ballast. To identify the ballast grading for heavy-haul rail track, monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests are conducted to assess the performances of different gradings. Permanent deformations, aggregates degradation, resilience, shear resistance, maximum and minimum densities are recorded and analysed. The grading is found to affect the behaviour of ballast in that coarser gradings exhibit relatively better strength, resilience and therefore less permanent deformation. However, ballast degradation increases with the overall aggregate size. Therefore, to identify the grading for ballast with different performance objectives, a grey relational theory is used to convert the multi-objective into single-objective, i. e. grey relational grade. A relatively optimal grading that provides the highest grey relational grade is thus suggested for the improved <b>ballast</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ballast is an {{essential}} layer of the railroad track structure, and provides primarily drainage and load distribution. In general, ballast aggregates are considered as uniformly graded, angular shaped with crushed faces. However, various ballast aggregate gradations and particle shapes are in use yet their effects on <b>ballast</b> <b>performances</b> remain unknown. In previous designs and modeling practices, railroad ballast has usually been treated as a homogeneous and continuous layer.

40|$|It is {{important}} to have consistent ballast testing methods that provide results reflecting the performance of different ballast materials in the railway trackbed. In this research, extensive laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the correlation between simple ballast index tests, and box tests simulating ballast field loading conditions in a simplified and controlled manner. In the box test, a sleeper load of 40 kN was applied to a simulated sleeper {{on the top of a}} sample of ballast in a box of dimensions 700 x 300 x 450 mm. The ballast was tamped using a Kango hammer which caused particles to rearrange as the level of the sleeper was raised. The ballast tests investigated in this project are those ballast tests specified in the Railtrack Line Specification (RT/CE/S/ 006 Issue 3, 2000), in addition to single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, petrographic analysis, and box tests. It was found that there was some correlation between the single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, box tests and petrographic analysis. One of the current ballast tests, namely the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) test, which is analogous to the oedometer test, is not appropriate because the ACV test uses 10 - 14 mm ballast particles, and there is a size effect on the strength of ballast and different ballasts have different size effects. However, if an oedometer test is used on track ballast, the results correlate better with ballast field performance as simulated in the box tests. Six ballasts were tested: A, B, C, D, E and F (mineralogy of these ballasts can be found in the appendix). The aim was to examine the relative performance of these ballasts and to establish which index tests were most indicative of performance in the box test. Simple index tests were performed on each of the ballasts, whilst box tests were only performed on ballasts A, B, C and D. The box tests were generally performed wet by adding a known volume of water at each tamp. For ballast A, controlled tests were also performed on dry ballast, and tests involving traffic loading only and tamping only were also conducted. A box test on 10 - 14 mm ballast A was also conducted to investigate the size effect on ballast behaviour in the box. The Wet Attrition Value (WAV), Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA), and Micro-Deval Attrition (MDA) seem to be suitable parameters to indicate <b>ballast</b> <b>performance</b> in the box test. However, this is considered to be due to the rearrangement of particles in the box test caused by the simulated tamping. In addition to the laboratory tests, the application of discrete element program PFC 3 D (Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., 1999) in simulating ballast behaviour was also investigated. Single particle crushing test was simulated to produce crushable agglomerates with a distribution of strengths of ballast A. These agglomerates were then used to simulate the oedometer test. The resulting normal compression line was compared with that for real oedometer tests: discrepancies can be attributed to the simplified geometry of the agglomerates. Due to the high computational time in simulating a box test with crushable agglomerates, uncrushable spherical balls and uncrushable angular agglomerates were used to represent individual ballast particles in the box. Important aspects of ballast behaviour under repeated loading, namely resilient and permanent deformation, were studied. It was found that the box test on uncrushable angular agglomerates give less permanent deformation compared with the test on spherical balls, because of the additional resistance provided by the irregular shape of the agglomerates.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{comprehensive}} investigation to find to what extent simple laboratory tests e. g. Los Angeles abrasion and micro-Deval might be suitable for predicting real railway <b>ballast</b> <b>performance</b> with respect to deformation and degradation. A number of tests to measure essential properties of ballast aggregate have been performed in addition to advanced material testing. Large cyclic triaxial loading test and full scale railway track model test were employed to simulate the effects of train loading and tamping, and to study settlement, stiffness and degradation {{of a range of}} ballast materials. The testing programme included both wet and dry testing conditions. All the rock types tested were mainly composed of combinations of principal rock-forming silicate minerals. They represent all together a wide variety of igneous, metamorphic and consolidated/metamorphosed sedimentary rocks mainly fine to very fine grained. Mechanical properties Change in the ballast grading proved to affect the ballast breakage development over time. However, the abrasion property expressed by the micro-Deval value did not show any association with the degradation of ballast under repeated load testing. Simulation of repeated tamping seemed to be the main source of ballast breakage. Most rocks showed high frost resistance after long term impact, but samples with high content of amphibole were less frost resistant. The rocks’ mechanical strength in terms of the Los Angeles abrasion or micro-Deval value did not show any correlation with either the amount of microcracks or the rocks’ average mineral grain size. A new method to measure the amount of microcracks based on luminescence measurements was developed. It is suggested that micro-cracks represent open channels for water to penetrate into the aggregate, which was confirmed by good correlation between water absorption and the amount of micro-cracks. Moisture had generally a negative effect on rocks’ mechanical strength according to Los Angeles abrasion and Point Load strength results. On the other hand, dry and wet triaxial tests with cyclic loadings did not confirm this effect. Neither did mineral grain size distribution show any correlation with mechanical strength, but the range of coefficient of conformity (Cu = D 60 /D 10) was probably too narrow to obtain a reliable conclusion. A new method to quantify the mineral grain size distribution was developed under these test series. Functional properties Both resilient modulus of the ballast layer and the stiffness of the track were governed by the materials’ grading curve and specific density. A possible relation between the amount of microcracks in the aggregate and resilient modulus as well as ballast breakage is suggested. The permanent vertical strain during repeated load testing was affected by both the micro-Deval value, the grading curve of the ballast and the aggregate’s content of soft minerals. Improvements of test methods The Los Angeles abrasion test distinguished clearly between the superior quality material and the very poor material. The Los Angeles abrasion value is, however, a poor parameter to indicate how the intermediate material will behave in service regarding ballast breakage. This study proposes to improve the ranking of ballast materials by introducing two additional methods. One which is able to measure some rocks’ ability to recover mechanical strength after repeated crushing, and one which measures the production of fines (0 / 0. 125 mm) during crushing. Saturation of ballast material before micro-Deval testing did not have any significant effect on degradation. Neither did the use of 1 % sodium-chloride solution have any effect.

40|$|Maintenance and {{eventual}} renewal of ballasted track constitute major operational costs for a railway network. Thus significant benefits would accrue {{from a more}} robust track design having a longer service life and reduced maintenance requirements. This paper presents results from a laboratory study exploring the potential to achieve this through improving the ballast grading and reducing the ballast shoulder slope. Cyclic loading tests were carried out on a section of track representing one sleeper bay in plane strain, in the Southampton Railway testing Facility (SRTF). A cyclic load representing a 20 tonne axle load was applied at 3 Hz for at least 3 million cycles, during which measurements of permanent and resilient vertical deflection were made. Certain interventions are found to result in lower rates of permanent settlement and different resilient ranges of movement. Supplementary measurements to determine longitudinal pressure, ballast breakage and attrition, and shoulder slope movement were used to explore the mechanisms responsible for the observed improvements in <b>ballast</b> bed <b>performance.</b> It is concluded {{that the use of}} finer ballast gradings and a shallower shoulder slope have the potential to reduce maintenance requirements...|$|R

Nineteen calibrated Type T thermocouples, distributed through the refrigerator interior, served as reference thermometers. Attachment of thermocouples directly to vaccine vials gave accurate measurements of the vaccine temperature, which often differed from the air or interior wall temperatures during door openings or defrost cycles. A household, fullsize freezerless refrigerator [capacity = 0. 473 m 3 (16. 7 cu. ft.) ] proved fully adequate at maintaining vial temperatures within the desired 2 °C to 8 °C range, independent of how the refrigerator was loaded.

50|$|Rail {{corrugation}} {{is a type}} {{of track}} wear that develops from track and train wheel set contact over time. Once this process has started it will begin to grow exponentially worse as time progresses. The wear that develops due to the wheel set contact between railways takes its form in the many troughs and crests it leaves behind over time {{which may or may not}} develop into rail corrugation depending on the circumstances. Rails that are heavily used and put under continual and constant wear will develop rail corrugation. Rail corrugation is represented in wavelength. Typically, heavily corrugated rails experience a concave deformation on the top of the railroad track in 20mm to 200mm intervals. Significant rail corrugation can decrease the service life span of tracks and make the replacement of the affected railroad track necessary. Rail corrugation is caused by the friction between the rail and the train wheels tangentially, vertically, and axially. Wear corrugation is a result of friction on the lower rail, which comes in contact with the train wheel. Excessive corrugation can be identified by the wavelength found on the higher, or outer, rail. Rail corrugation may be limited or lessened with the use of heat treated or alloyed rails, as oppose to the traditionally used carbon composite rail. The estimated tendency for wear is calculated by taking into account fluctuations in track and wheel set contact which causes the amount of wear to vary. The dynamic properties of different lines of the track can lead to varied degrees of rail corrugation through the use of high-speed wheel sets. In a study of high-speed railroad tracks, four types of tracks were studied for their tendency to develop corrugation (RHEDA 200, AFTRAV, STEDEF, and high <b>performance</b> <b>ballasted</b> track) and of the four considered the ballasted track was the one least prone to rail corrugation with the AFTRAV track being the second most reliable as well.|$|R
40|$|Railways are {{integral}} to the transportation system of a growing economy. There is a constant demand by numerous stakeholders of the railway industry for greater train operational speeds, tonnage, passenger comfort and safety with minimal service disruptions. This is partly achievable through {{the improvement of the}} main components of railway track. A fundamental requirement for any railway track {{is to be able to}} maintain its as-built geometry over its service life. Settlement of a ballasted railway track is mainly caused by cyclic loading due to the passage of traffic. To return the rail track to the as-built alignment and level, track maintenance needs to be carried out. Tamping is one of the most common and traditional ways of maintaining the track and is not only costly but causes interruption to the day-to-day operations and damages the long term <b>performance</b> of the <b>ballasted</b> track. It therefore remains important to policy makers, rail practitioners and researchers to identify new techniques, innovations or processes that will prolong intervals between scheduled track maintenance. Track settlement is influenced by several interrelated track variables, not least of which are the railway sleeper, ballast and ballast-sleeper interface that have potential for alteration to be optimised with respect to the track performance. In this research, results are presented from a parametric experimental study using three different apparatus namely box test (confined), Composite Element Test (CET) (semi-confined), and Railway Test Facility (RTF) (full-scale), to investigate performance of different sleeper and ballast configurations. The box test and the CET apparatus were used ahead of the RTF (full-scale) apparatus as preliminary tests to obtain an insight into the performance and potential benefits of different sleeper types with and without the use of Under Sleeper Pads (USPs). The aforementioned apparatus were also used for comparison with the full-scale apparatus to assess the consistency of the sleeper settlement results (phase 1 tests). The purpose of using the box test and CET apparatus was also to allow a relatively large number of simplified tests to be carried out on sleeper and ballast combinations (Phase 2 tests) within a reasonable cost and time frame. Phase 2 tests were designed and conducted with consideration of the phase 1 test results. The test results from phase 1 showed that increasing the number of contact points between ballast particles and sleeper, and increasing the coefficient of friction at ballast-sleeper interface improved the settlement performance of the tarckbed. Therefore, having this in mind, further tests were designed and conducted including: finer ballast grading, two-layered ballast systems, frictional sleepers and USPs, and USP types with various stiffnesses. In addition, further tests on ballast bonding/gluing and ballast reinforcement were conducted with the aim of investigating possible ways of minimising ballast bed deterioration. Application of ballast gluing was proven beneficial (in literature) in improving <b>ballast</b> bed <b>performance,</b> however, the overall cost of super glues used for this method was high. Therefore in this study, a low cost glue was introduced and its performance was tested under conditions similar to real track. With regard to ballast reinforcement, the expanded polystyrene was added to the ballast sample with the aim of decreasing the contact forces between ballast particles and consequently minimising ballast bed deterioration and settlement. The observations in this study sought to establish qualitative and quantitative data on the effects of different parameters on the track performance, which may lead to a longer service life with less maintenance. The results showed that the type of sleeper has an influence on the performance of a railway track. With respect to settlement performance of a railway track, sleepers with higher depth and width, coefficient friction, and bending stiffness performed better. Out of all investigated sleeper types without any additional interventions, concrete mono-block gave the least settlement and the plastic sleeper gave the most. It was also found that inclusion of USPs (regardless of type) can be beneficial compared to the ‘no USP’ scenario in: (1) Increasing trackbed resiliency. (2) Reducing maintenance works related to settlement. (3) Reducing sleeper deflections (hogging) at the middle of sleeper. (4) Reducing the rate of deterioration of sleeper support at the rail seat (6) Reducing differences in the performance of different sleeper types. (7) Reducing tendency towards centre binding. (8) Reducing transmitted pressure on subgrade. (9) Making the trackbed stiffness more uniform. The conclusion of research was that use of concrete mono-block sleeper, USPs, finer ballast grading, a two-layered ballast system with finer ballast grading on top, frictional sleeper, frictional USP, and ballast gluing all have potential to improve the <b>performance</b> of <b>ballasted</b> railway track and reduce the maintenance requirements...|$|R
40|$|The Great Ships Initiative (GSI) {{provides}} independent, no-cost performance/verification testing {{services to}} developers of ballast water treatment systems (BWTSs) at the bench, land-based and shipboard scales. GSI has the expertise {{and resources to}} perform tests consistent {{with the requirements of}} the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (IMO, 2004) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA’s) Environmental Technology Verification Program’s Generic Protocol (ETV; USEPA, 2010). GSI performs formal verification tests appropriate to market-ready prototype BWTSs, and informal status testing for BWTSs that are still in the research and development stages. GSI procedures, methods, materials and findings are publicly accessible on the GSI website (www. greatshipsinitiative. org). In early 2011, researchers from the National Parks of Lake Superior Foundation (NPLSF) in Marquette, Michigan, and the Michigan Technological University (MTU) in Houghton, Michigan, applied to GSI for land-based tests of a BWTS involving sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), in the same formulation used for household bleach. The BWTS was proposed for emergency treatment of ballast water in tanks of Great Lakes vessels passing through the Welland Canal system of the St. Lawrence Seaway into the upstream lakes. The method involves multiple steps: • Determination of the natural chlorine demand of the ballast water one day ahead of treatment application, i. e., prior to the vessel’s entry into the Canal, for example, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; • Determination of the necessary volume of 6. 15 % NaOCl solution {{to be added to the}} ballast water to overcome the natural chlorine demand and deliver a predetermined chlorine concentration; • Mixing using a method designed by the researchers; • Retention of the treated ballast water in tank for a predetermined length of time (i. e., exposure period); • Determination of residual chlorine concentration, and determination and application of the amount of a neutralizer necessary to fully neutralize the treated water for safe discharge; and • Verification of complete neutralization prior to the vessel’s departure from the Canal system. Tests took place at GSI’s Land-Based Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDTE) Facility in Superior, Wisconsin, in October 2011, with the goal of status testing for research and development purposes. As such, the testing was based on, though not strictly consistent with, the IMO’s G 8 Guidelines for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems (IMO, 2008 a), the IMO’s G 9 Guidelines for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems that make use of Active Substances (IMO, 2008 b) and the USEPA ETV Program’s Generic Protocol for the Verification of Ballast Water Treatment Technology, v. 5. 1 (USEPA, 2010). During the test, GSI implemented the entire proposed NaOCl BWTS method with the exception of the automated mixing system; trialing the mixing apparatus at a land-based facility would offer little insight into its capability on board a ship in any case. GSI evaluated the BWTS for its ability to: • Deliver the target concentration of chlorine (above natural chlorine demand) using a 6. 15 % NaOCl solution, and deliver the target concentration of neutralizer; • Reduce densities of live organisms in intake water from prescribed threshold densities to below densities allowed by the <b>Ballast</b> Water <b>Performance</b> Standard of the IMO Convention (IMO, 2004); and • Result in treatment water safe to discharge in terms of residual chlorine concentration and whole effluent toxicity (WET). Disinfection by products (DBPs) were also measured and reported. The GSI test of the NaOCl BWTS yielded mixed results. In terms of operational performance, GSI was able to accurately dose a sampled volume of water with 6. 15 % NaOCl solution to a predetermined chlorine concentration by factoring in the natural chlorine demand. The neutralization process recommended by the BWTS developer did require additional neutralizer additions, which could be problematic in an actual shipboard situation. More research is needed on the effect of temperature and water quality on the ability of sodium bisulfite (NaHSO 3) or a neutralization substitute to successfully neutralize NaOCl-treated water for BWTS application in the real-world. Second, the BWTS reduced live densities of organisms ≥ 50 μm which were adequately plentiful in the intake to meet IMO testing guidelines, relative to control discharge. But BWTS live discharge densities were well above the IMO benchmark (IMO, 2004). The BWTS did reduce live densities of organisms > 10 and < 50 μm minimum dimension to below benchmark levels within the IMO Convention, but intake densities of these organisms also were below IMO testing guidelines due to the late season timing of the tests (IMO, 2004). Finally, the treated and neutralized discharge water was found to be safe to discharge (though, in some cases only after multiple neutralization steps) and free from toxicity in Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests conducted by GSI. Measurable concentrations of DBP were found in the treatment discharge, specifically trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA). Overall, the GSI results show that the NaOCl BWTS both warrants and would benefit from further research and development on its potential as an emergency BWTS with relevancy in the Great Lakes...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic {{invasive}} species {{are among the}} worst threats to marine biodiversity. The main vector for the spread of these aquatic {{invasive species}} is ships’ ballast water. Because of this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the Ballast Water Convention. Part of this convention is the D- 2 <b>ballast</b> water <b>performance</b> standard, which sets limits {{to the amount of}} viable organisms allowed to be in ballast water upon discharge. The limits of the D- 2 standard are: 1. less than 10 viable organisms/m 3 in the size class = 50 µm; 2. less than 10 viable organisms/mL in the size class = 10 - < 50 µm; 3. limits on the abundance of toxigenic Vibrio cholera, Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. In order to meet this standard, manufacturers developed different types of Ballast Water Treatment Systems (BWTSs). These BWTSs need to be approved according to IMO regulations by an independent party. Several approval tests were performed at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research (NIOZ). The focus of this thesis was to test the effects of various ballast water treatment methods on the survival of phytoplankton and bacteria. Different methods are used to reduce the numerical abundance of organisms, most notably Ultraviolet-radiation (UV) and ‘active substances’ (chemicals). Both treatment methods were considered in this thesis. To measure the efficacy of different BWTSs, methods had to be developed that are applicable to all types of treatments. The standard IMO regulations state that treated ballast water has to be stored in the dark in simulated ballast water tanks for five days before being tested against the D- 2 standard. However, it was questionable if this time period would be sufficient to account for delayed effects of the disinfectant and possible recovery of organisms. In other words, it was not known if re-growth of micro-organisms could occur after this standardized five day period. Therefore, in the present thesis, the possibility of re-growth was examined by executing long term incubation experiments under light-dark conditions simulating the post-discharge situation in the open sea. Phytoplankton and bacterial abundance, composition and diversity were monitored by a range of analytical techniques, including classical microscopy, flow cytometry and molecular fingerprinting. In a first series of experiments, UV and chlorine dioxide (CD) treated water was incubated for 20 days under favorable conditions with respect to irradiance and nutrient availability to stimulate the growth of micro-organisms that had survived the treatment. After both treatments, re-growth of phytoplankton occurred (Chapter 2). This suggests that currently approved BWTSs meet the IMO D- 2 standard, but do not completely eliminate the potential spread of aquatic organisms through ballast water. To identify the species that re-grew after ballast water treatment, UV treated samples were incubated and monitored for phytoplankton abundance and species composition. Microscopy showed that ballast water treatment changed the species composition and that certain species were more likely to re-grow after treatment (Chapter 3). However, microscopy was not always able to identify the exact species. Because of this the application of flow cytometry, microscopy and DNA-sequencing as methods of species identification were investigated. Flow cytometry provided fast quantification of phytoplankton, but could only provide a rough indication of phytoplankton diversity. Microscopy provided a more qualitative method of identification, but could not always identify the phytoplankton to the species level. DNA-sequencing provided accurate species identification but proved to be time-consuming and only identified {{one or two of the}} most dominant species in the sample. The most common re-growing species after UV treatment proved to be Thalassiosira weissflogii. This indicates that some species are more likely to survive ballast water 93 treatment than others and that ballast water treatment may apply selective force to create resistant species (Chapter 4). In the follow-up experiment, phytoplankton re-growth was monitored in six BWTSs; three systems were based on UV, two based on electrochlorination (EC) and one based on chlorine dioxide (CD). All BWTSs incubation experiments were performed for 20 days with treated ballast water, during which growth, photosynthetic efficiency and phytoplankton species composition were followed. The three UV systems all showed the same pattern after the initial UV exposure, notably a gradual decrease in phytoplankton abundances followed by re-growth. Treatments using 200 % or 400 % of the normal UV dose reduced phytoplankton numbers more strongly, but did not prevent their re-growth. Results of EC and CD BWTSs were comparable to each other. However, UV and active substance-based treatment systems showed significantly different responses. Both types of systems showed an immediate reduction in phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency. However, for UV treatment systems phytoplankton abundances decreased over several days while for chlorine-based treatment systems the drop in phytoplankton abundance was immediate. The species composition of re-growing phytoplankton also differed between UV and EC treatment. Overall, all BWTSs reduced phytoplankton abundances to below the values of the D- 2 standard, which represents a reduced risk of future aquatic invasions through ballast water. However, all (but one) re-growing species were smaller than 10 µm, which means they are not covered by the D- 2 standard (Chapter 5). To assess possible environmental risks associated with BWTSs that use ‘active substances’, a BWTS that uses a chemical mixture known as Peraclean® Ocean (PO) was evaluated. The residual of PO is acetate that might be present in concentrations exceeding 100 mg/L in discharged ballast water. To study the potential environmental impact of PO, microbial dynamics and acetate degradation were measured during incubation of discharge water following PO treatment. In addition, microbial dynamics and acetate degradation were studied at different temperatures in dark microcosms that simulated enclosed ballast water tanks. After about nine days bacteria abundances greatly increase in PO treated waters to almost ten times of initial control abundances. Furthermore, bacterial diversity was also altered by the changes in water chemistry. Breakdown of acetate occurred faster at higher temperatures. At the lowest temperatures almost no acetate breakdown occurred, but even at the highest temperature the acetate pool was not depleted. This implies that not all acetate will be broken down in ballast water tanks, even during long voyages in warm waters. It was concluded from this study that regular discharge of acetate-containing ballast water in harbors and bays may stimulate growth of heterotrophic bacteria, causing oxygen depletion and changes in the microbial community, especially in colder regions (Chapter 6). The D- 2 standard does not consider total heterotrophic bacterial abundances. Increases in bacterial abundance as shown for this BWTS are allowed under current IMO regulations. The potential harmful effects on the ecosystem presented by the discharge of bacteria-rich ballast water demonstrate the necessity to include total heterotrophic bacteria in the D- 2 standard. In conclusion, the present thesis has revealed two major shortcomings in the ballast water regulations and particularly in the D- 2 standard. It is recommended that the D- 2 standard is amended to include limit values for viable phytoplankton and zooplankton organisms < 10 µm as well as total heterotrophic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringDuring {{the last}} decades {{there have been several}} major ship accidents, and it is {{believed}} that old ships are more unsafe than newer ships. To get a better understanding of this phenomenon the thesis is investigating different issues with ship ageing. This thesis consists of a general description of the most important ageing issues, and the condition of sea water ballast tanks is identified {{as one of the most}} critical issue regarded to ageing on LPG-tankers. This investigation consists of a theoretical description and evaluation of different corrosion mechanisms, fatigue, buckling and steel protection. The different rules and regulation for new build, maintenance and inspection of ballast tanks are discussed, and there have been physical inspections of some ballast tanks on some selected ships (25, 15 and 1 year old ships). A high number of ballast tanks inspection report are reviewed and used as a basis for the conclusions. To demonstrate the importance of proper steel protection, a life time evaluation of critical areas in ballast tanks are carried out. There are five different ageing issues concerning a gas-tanker, seen through a shipping company, as listed below 	Functional ageing 	Technological ageing 	Knowledge based ageing 	Organizational ageing 	Commercial ageing Market related Every one of the ageing mechanisms can affect the lifetime of the ship in different ways. Commercial ageing can be the most fixed ageing mechanism, where the charterer sets a maximum age on ships they will charter. The major oil and gas companies have a maximum age on gas-tankers to be 20 – 25 years old, regardless of the actual condition of the ship. Most of the oil and gas companies require the ships to be in better condition than minimum class requirement, and require ships older than 15 years old to have a Condition Assessment Program – CAP rating of 1 or 2, where CAP 1 is very good condition, CAP 3 is class limit, and CAP 4 is below class limit. Concerning functional ageing, the sea water ballast tanks are a weak link. The ballast tanks have a very corrosive environment with sea water when filled and a humid salty environment when empty. There are (from 2006) strict requirements for coating in <b>ballast</b> tanks called <b>Performance</b> Standard for Protective Coating – PSPC, in addition cathodic protection can be used. This study shows that the top of the wing ballast tanks are the most critical area concerning heavy corrosion in case of coating breakdown. This due to: 	Good supply of oxygen in ballast condition because the tank will in most cases not be filled to the top, and therefore no protection from the offer anodes. 	Moist and salty environment with good supply of oxygen in loaded condition (empty for water) I. e. the cathodic protection is not effective. Rules and regulations require the ship owner to have maintenance and inspection routines of all the important parts of the ship. In Solvang the chief officer inspects all the ballast tanks every 6 th months. The ballast tank inspections that are reviewed show a varying degree of corrosion on the different ships. The maintenance procedures have been updated lately due to problems with coating breakdown shortly after coating maintenance. From the review of the ballast tank condition it seems clear that often the identified corrosion was left unrepaired. The best practice would be to maintain the corrosion spot right away, and prevent the corrosion to expand. If not, the coating will demand more extensive maintenance later. The reasons for postponement of maintenance in ballast tanks can be many. With regard to all the ship accidents that have happened the last 50 years, very few of them are directly caused by ageing mechanisms such as corrosion and fatigue. After MV Flare, MV Erika and MV Prestige which sank in 1998, 1999 and 2002 respectively, there have not (known to the undersigned) been any major ship disasters caused by ageing mechanisms. There have been other accidents such as groundings, collisions and collapse of hull due to bad design, but that type of accidents is not of interest in this thesis. The few accidents in the later years indicates that the rules and requirement regulating the shipping industry (IMO, IACS, class societies, flag state, port control, vetting. etc.) are showing a real effect on the accident rate concerning ageing mechanisms. MV Flare was a bulk carrier, and MV Erika and MV Prestige were oil tankers which sank due to ageing mechanisms. No liquefied gas tankers are known (to undersigned) to sink due to ageing mechanisms. This means that the assumption that an older LPG-tanker may be more unsafe due to ageing not is the case. It is not the age, but the overall condition that decides if the ship is unsafe or not. To evaluate the effect of coating breakdown in ballast tanks some simplified evaluations for buckling capacity and fatigue life were carried out. With localized corrosion that often appears in ballast tanks, the results found showed that the local buckling capacity may be reduced severely in a relatively short period of time. (~ 5 years) Two different approaches for calculating the fatigue life have been used. The calculations show that the approach for offshore structures give approximately 50 % of the fatigue life compared to the ship rules, in corrosive environment. Both methods show that the fatigue life reduces drastically with coating breakdown...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Dünyada ticari eşyaların % 80 ’i deniz taşımacılığı ile taşınmaktadır ve her yıl yaklaşık olarak 3 - 5 milyar balast suyu uluslararası denizlerde bu şekilde {{transfer}} edilmektedir. Balast suyunun bu şekilde taşınması geminin dengesi ve stabilitesinin sağlanması için gereklidir. Dünyada farklı limanlarda yapılmış olan birçok çalışmada balast suyu sucul organizmaların, bakteri ve virüsleri de içeren insan patojenlerinin transfer edilmesinde önemli bir role sahiptir. Balast suyunun alımı sırasında kıyı sularına deniz istilacı türlerinin girişi ve daha sonra sediment ve biyofilmler ile birlikte uzak limanlarda gemi balast tanklarından tahliyesi kıyı ve deniz ekosistemi için önemli bir tehdit oluşturmaktadır. Balast suyunun yönetimi için ‘Gemi Balast Suları ve Sedimanlarının Kontrolü ve Yönetimi Uluslararası Sözleşmesi’ Uluslararası Denizcilik Örgütü tarafından 2004 yılında kabul edilmiştir. Bu sözleşmede, balast suyu değişimi için D- 1 standardı, balast suyunun performansı için D- 2 standardı, güvenlik, test gereklilikleri ve prosedürleri ile birlikte istisnai durumlar tanımlanmıştır. Yeni balast suyu kurallarına uyum sağlanması, önümüzdeki yıllar içinde denizcilik endüstrisinin en önemli maliyet güçlüğü olarak karşısına çıkacaktır. Balast suyu yönetimi sözleşmesine göre, 2009 yılından önce inşa edilmiş, balast kapasitesi 1500 m 3 ’ten küçük olan gemiler ile 2012 yılından önce inşa edilmiş, balast kapasitesi 5000 m 3 ’ten büyük gemilerde 2016 yılı sonuna kadar ve 2009 yılından önce inşa edilmiş, balast kapasitesi 1500 – 5000 m 3 arasında olan gemilerde 2014 yılı sonuna kadar D- 2 standardının sağlanması gerekmektedir. Bu sebepten tüm ilgililer Uluslararası Denizcilik Örgütü kurallarına göre alternatif sistemler araştırmaktadır. Tank sedimanlarının yönetim masraflarına ek olarak sözleşmenin D- 2 performans standartlarını karşılamak için oluşan masrafları ve operasyonel düzenlemeleri azaltmak veya kaçınmak için balast suyu yönetimi alternatiflerine olan ilgi gün geçtikçe artmaktadır. Bazı armatörler yerel standartlara sahip özel bölgelerde balast suyunu tahliye etmek için yeterli sisteme sahip değildir veya arıtım sistemleri bulunmamaktadır. Bu yüzden balast suyu yönetimi kurallarını karşılayabilmek için liman balast suyu alım tesislerinin mevcut bulunması balast suyunu tahliye etmek için alternatif çözüm olacaktır. Fakat bu liman balast suyu alım tesislerinin, kurulumunda ve işletilmesinde yaşanabilecek zorlukların değerlendirilmesinin yapılması gerekmektedir. Bunun için mevcut atık alım tesisleri ele alınabilir. Türkiye özelinde 2013 yılında 1717 geminin uğrak yaptığı Borusan limanı değerlendirildiğinde mevcut atık alım tesislerinden çok daha fazla elleçleme kapasitesine sahip alım tesislerine ihtiyaç bulunmaktadır. Balast suyunun alternatif yönetiminde, gemi dizaynları ile balast suyunun tahliye edilmemesi, balast suyunun kullanılmaması, konteyner gemilerinde balast suyu olarak katı balast kullanılması ve akış yöntemleri ile kaldırma kuvvetinden yararlanılan yöntemler bulunmaktadır. Bu çalışmada, balast suyu ve arıtım sistemleri tanıtılarak, balast suyunun yönetimi için alternatif yöntemler ile birlikte balast suyunun liman tesislerine alınması konusunda bilgilere ve değerlendirmelere yer verilmiştir. Shipping {{moves over}} 80 % of the world’s commodities and transfers approximately 3 to 5 {{billion tons of}} ballast water internationally each year {{that is necessary to}} provides ships’ trimming and stability. Many studies signified {{in different parts of the}} world have shown that ships’ ballast water has very important role for the transfer aquatic organism, human pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Therefore, the marine environment is at risk to happen a serious ecological problem during discharging ballast water. The introduction of marine invasive species to coastal waters when ships take on ballast water at one port and then discharge with water, sediments, and biofilms from ships’ ballast water tanks it at other, ports is a significant threat to coastal and ocean ecosystems and economies. And, impacts on human and animal health, the environment and socio-economic activities appear. For example, the European zebra mussel has infested over 40 % of internal waterways in United States. In 2004, with ‘International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments’ is adopted by International Maritime Organization, that describes D- 1 standard for ballast water exchange, D- 2 standard for <b>ballast</b> water <b>performance,</b> including the safety, testing requirements and procedures together with exceptional cases. Complying with the new ballast regulations is one of the most significant cost challenges the shipping industry can except to face over the next few years. According to the Ballast Water Management convention, D- 2 standard must be provided for the ballast water capacity less than 1500 m 3 (built from 2009) and the ballast water capacity greater than 5000 m 3 (built from 2012) until the end of 2016 and the ballast water capacity between 1500 – 5000 m 3 (built from 2009) until the end of 2014. For this reason, all parties have been researching alternative systems as per International Maritime Organization regulations. This study describes ballast water treatment systems together with ballast water and invasive species description. The ballast water treatment technology used to treat ballast water has generally been derived from other treatment systems, in which forms of solid-liquid separation and disinfection processes were applied. There are three treatment technology types, which are generally combined that are mechanical, chemical and disinfection. Most systems employ a two-stage approach involving mechanical separation at the first stage, followed by a second stage physical or chemical treatment. At this stage some systems use a combination of two or more treatments. In this study summarizes some systems which were approved or designed and tested. Chemical treatment use active substances to treat microorganisms, and for this, sufficient stocks will have to be carried on board. Therefore, this treatment would not be preferred by shipowners due to producing by-products with their chemical reactions to cause environmental threat. There are so many treatment systems on the market. The existing vessels can be integrated and retrofitted with these systems. Following adoption of the Ballast Water Management Convention, interest in these alternatives to conventional Ballast Water Management has increased since they offer ways to avoid, or substantially reduce, the operational issues and costs of treating compartmentalized ballast water to meet the Convention’s respective D- 2 discharge standards, plus the cost of managing tank sediments. There is limited information in evaluating of these new technologies in reducing the transfer of harmful species in accordance with the goals of the Ballast Water Management Convention. This study gives informations and perspectives about intaking ballast water in the port reception facilities together with alternative methods related with the ballast water management. Ships that cannot meet this requirement for onboard ballast water treatment may be allowed to discharge ballast water to a port-based ballast water reception facility, which is generally understood to mean either a shore-based or barge-based ballast water treatment facility. This system has some disadvantages such as potential delays, sufficient space and equipment suitability. For this, in this study gives case study of port of Baltimore as an example to analyze economically and logistically port reception facilities. According to this case, port reception facility are feasible. On the other hand, technically that can be challenges. Additionally, port reception facilities evaluate in Turkey from this perspective and compared with the port of Baltimore for space situation. Some shipowners have not ballast water treatment system or, have treatment system but their system performance is not enough to discharge of ballast water at the special zones where exist a local standard. Therefore, complying with ballast water regulations, port reception facilities will be alternative solution in order to discharge ballast water. In this study gives information about waste reception facilities in Turkey to analyze challenges that can be occurred in port reception facilities. For this, when Borusan port where called 1717 vessels in 2013 is evaluated, it appears that ports need a port ballast water reception facilities which has more capacity than present waste reception facilities. Additionally, there are many concepts have been designed zero or minimal discharge (such as storm ballast, internal ballast and potable water), no ballast or continuous flow methods that are longitudinal trunks, ship buoyancy control and enhanced ballast water exchange concepts. All continuous flow systems readily exceed the performance required by the D- 1 exchange standard but this standard is to be withdrawn at the end of 2014 / 2016. In regard to other zero ballast methods that may include their high build costs and relatively large wetted surfaces when loaded. The amount will vary according to the design cargo type and capacity, cargo loading and unloading requirements and other trading factors. At the same time, solid ballast method can be alternatively used for the container vessel. As container vessels can be arranged for solid ballast with empty positioning in export and import leg on their rotation. This method would be more attractive for retrofits or new builds than modified container ships. Results of this study underline that alternative system is very crucial for removing invasive species. In the future studies, numeric analyses and assessments of port reception facilities and the other alternative systems such as ballast free and no ballast can be proposed. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Deniz taşımacılığı dünya ticaretinde oldukça büyük bir öneme sahiptir. Uluslararası nakliyeciliğin % 90 'ının gemiler ile yapıldığı günümüzde, gemilerin maksimum yük ve minimum balast ile seyir etmeleri ekonomik olarak tercih edilse de, gemilerin güvenli seyri açısından bu mümkün değildir. Gemilerin balast tanklarına alınan balast suyu ile her gün yaklaşık 7. 000 canlı farklı bir ekosisteme taşınmaktadır. Bu canlıların bir kısmı balast tanklarındaki koşullara karşı dayanıklı olup, geminin sefer süresi boyunca hayatta kalabilmektedirler. Hayatta kalmayı başarabilen canlılar, kimi zaman balast suyu ile boşaltıldıkları ekosistemlerde varlıklarını sürdürüp, yerli türlerin varlığını tehdit edebilirler. Bu yabancı türler sadece ekosistemdeki canlılara zarar vermekle kalmaz, balıkçılığı etkileyerek ekonomik zararlara yol açabilirler, insan sağlığına zarar verebilirler ve sahillerde biyolojik kirliliğe neden olup deniz turizmini olumsuz yönde etkilerler. Balast tanklarındaki su ile taşınan zararlı sucul istilacı türlerin verdikleri zararların boyutlarının ciddi olduğunun farkına varılması ile, ulusal ve uluslararası düzeyde pek çok düzenleme ve çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Yapılan çalışmalar, balast tankları ile taşınan istilacı türlerin sorun olmalarını engellemek için, balast suyunun bu canlılardan arındrılmasına yönelik sistemlerin geliştirilmesini sağlamıştır. Uluslararası Denizcilik Örgütü tarafından 2004 yılında üye ülkelerin imzasına açılan Gemi Balast Suları ve Sedimenti Kontrolü ve Yönetimi Sözleşmesi yürürlüğe girdikten sonra, balast suyu arıtma sistemlerinin gemilerde kullanılması zorunlu hale gelecektir. Bu gereklilik ticari açıdan pek çok üretici firmanın balast suyu arıtma sistemi geliştirmesi ile sonuçlanmıştır. Piyasada balast suyu arıtma sistemi üreticileri arasındaki rekabet, gemi sahiplerini gemileri için en uygun olan sistemi seçme konusunda zora sokmaktadır. Çalışmada, hangi yöntemler ile balast suyu arıtılabilindiğine dair detaylı bilgi verilmiş, sonrasında ise balast suyu arıtma sistemi seçerken dikkat edilmesi gereken teknik ve ticari konulara değinilmiştir. Yeni inşa edilen gemiler için sistem seçmek problem olmasa da, Gemi Balast Suları ve Sedimenti Kontrolü ve Yönetimi Sözleşmesi yürürlüğe girdikten sonra inşa yılı eski olan pek çok gemiye balast suyu arıtma sisteminin entegre edilmesi, hem teknik hem de ticari açıdan oldukça zorlu bir süreçtir. Çalışmada detayları anlatılan Anahtar Performans Göstergeleri (KPI) yöntemi ile sistemin kullanılacağı gemilerin özelliklerine göre aynı anda pek çok sistem karşılaştırılıp, en uygun olan sistemin belirlenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Maritime {{transportation}} {{has significant}} importance for international trade. Today, ships carry approximately 90 {{percent of all}} global trade. For commercial concerns, it is preferred to travel with maximum cargo and minimum ballast. However, as ballast water is used to provide stability and maneuverability during voyage, travelling with minimum ballast can cause safety problems on ships. In 1800 's, solid materials such as sand, detritus and iron were usually loaded onboard {{in order to provide}} ballast. After use, these materials were discharged to water and could be able to used by other ships. But this technique was not only time consuming but also not effective. By technological progresses through the end of 1800 's, the sea water had been used as ballast. There were not segregated ballast water tanks as it is today. The water used as ballast was stored in empty cargo tanks. The remain of the cargo such as oil, iron, etc. mixed with ballast water. The mix of these remains and water could be toxic and discharging these water to the marine environment were caused environmental and health problems. After realizing these problems, in 1980 's, segregated ballast water tanks were designed and used in order to provide contamination of ballast water. However, as the ballast water became cleaner, there arrised another problems, invasive species. With ballast waters, every day more than 7. 000 different marine species are transferred to different ecosystems. The size of the organisms in ballast water varies from micrometric viruses to organisms up to thirty centimeters. The ones who can survive in ballast tank conditions are discharged at other ports within ballast water. These organisms are called as "invasive species". The introduction of invasive marine species into a new environments by ships' ballast water has been stated as one of the four greatest treats to marine ecosystems. The problems due to the invaisve species can be analyzed in three main sections; impacts on ecology, impacts on economy and impacts on health. Introducing of invasive species can cause problems on native species. The most known example of invasive species effects on environment is recorded in Grate Lakes, United States. This area has been damaged by more than 180 invasive species during years. Zebra mussels, sea lamprey, alewife etc. were introduced to lakes and spreaded, competed with native species and damaged the food chain. These invasion problem also have effects on fisheries, factories n coastal areas. The zebra mussels has spreads more than 40 percent of US waters and cost more than US$ 750 million between 1989 - 2000. Also, it is estimated that invasive species cause US$ 138 billion per year in only USA. Moreover, if the ballast water contaminated with pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae discharged into the sea, this may cause illness and death in humans. After realizing these serious problems caused by the organisms carried in ballast water, there have been conducting national and international regulations. In 2004, the IMO introduced "International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments". With these regulations, the problems caused by ballast water have attracted attentions and the companies have started to research and develop ballast water management technologies. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 States, representing 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage. Once entered into force, BMW convention requires all ships to use ballast water treatment systems in order to meet <b>Ballast</b> Water <b>Performance</b> Standard (Regulation D- 2). There have been introduced many different ballast water treatment methods. These methods can be mainly divided in three groups; mechanical methods, physical methods and chemical methods. The mechanical methods are filtration and cyclonic separation. With these applications, organisms bigger than 40 - 50 micron can be able to seperated from ballast water. As physical methods, there have been developed system that use heat treatment, ultra sound treatment, de-oxidizing, ultra viole and coagulation. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, these advantages and disadvantages of the methods are explained in details. There are also systems that uses oxidizing or non-oxidizing biocides. However, using there method on its own is not enough for BMW convention requires. In order to meet these requirement, usually combined systems such as mechanical + physical or mechanical + chemical are used for ballast water management. There are many companies developed new technologies and systems in order to treat ballast water. As the number of the companies and systems are a lot, shipyards and ship owners have difficulties to find the most suitable ballast water treatment system for their ship. To be able to find the suitable system, there are some factors that need to be considered by both system distributers and shipyards/ship owners. The most important point is the ship type, thus ballast capacity of the vessel. The vessels are divided into two categories in terms of their ballast capacity; high ballast dependent vessels such as bulk carriers and tankers and low ballast dependent vessels such as containerships and other vessels like chemical carriers, passenger ships, Ro/Ro etc. As the range of the ballast capacities are wide range, this can be determinant factor to choose ballast water treatment system, because many companies are powerful in certain pump capacity ranges. Also the water characteristics such as turbidity, salinity and silt content has effects on ballast water treatment. Other factors such as space, power requirement, vessel service area, health and safety requirements are investigated in details. A case study has been examined in seventh section of the study. There has been chosen two ships in order to show how to decide ballast water treatment system. Three combined systems using filtration + UV are considered for the vessels. Technical and design details are given in section 7. After comparing investment and operating costs of the system, the most suitable one is chosen for each vessel. The detailed investment and operation cost comparison is given in the related section. This part shows how a shipyard approaches choosing a ballast water treatment system for a vessel. However, once the BMW regulations enter into force, there will be many vessels that are need to be retrofitted. The system choosing period will not be that easy. In section eight, the main focus area of this study is explained. As there will be a huge work load on shipyards/system distributors to identify the most suitable system for many vessels. In this section, a model developed in Microsoft Excel to find suitable systems that can be applied to many vessels by using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The model has two parts. In first part, there has been developed an automatic process to eliminate the unsuitable systems. The requirements set up by shipyards/ship owners are compared with the systems' data. With this process, the systems that are not meet the shipyards'/ship owners' requirements are identified. In second part, the system are compared in details. Every criterias which are stated in the study are graded from 1 to 6 and compared with each other. This process helps us to specify system points and find the most suitable system for vessel/vessels. In this study, only two vessels and three systems for each vessel are examined due to the confidentiality. Even so, the advantages of using KPI while choosing a ballast water treatment system can be easily seen from the study. In case of many system offers, in order to make better comparison, using KPI has benefits for shipyards. This study shows that KPI analyze makes system selection easy and reliable. Yüksek LisansM.
