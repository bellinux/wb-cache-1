The Khasi incorporate aerial roots from overhanging trees to form support spans and safety handrails. Some bridges can carry fifty or more people at once.

Sweden ratified the UNESCO Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangeble Cultural heritage in 2003, the challenges of building a sustinible future and the manitanance of our whole built cultural heritage are central reasons. During 2010 and 2011 I was through my work involved in two substantial inventories with the aim of mapping the national situation of craft skills. One inventorie was conducted as a number of seminars arranged all over the country inviting craftsmen and people who work with restaurations to discuss the need for knowledge and what is already provided for. The other inventorie was a survey that was e-mailed to 1 440 persons working in crafts and restaurations ask of their need of traning and their oppinion of other persons need of traning and knowledge. Together with a review of the existing craft schools and educational programs in <b>building</b> <b>craft</b> skills I have been able to identify a number of skills that are in decline or in some cases already forgotten. But I can also distinguish areas where the knowledge exists and the interest increases.

40|$|This thesis explores {{critical}} regionalism {{and sustainable}} design through the adaptive reuse {{of the former}} Interwoven Stocking Company mill in Martinsburg, West Virginia. New programming establishes the manufacturing complex as the Interwoven School of Crafts, a learning institution dedicated {{to the production of}} functional, handcrafted arts and thereby also to the continuance of local culture. Regionalistic ideas are further explored through the development of a visitor center and gallery building that showcases the work of the artists. Nestled within the historic complex, this contemporary building is the interface between spaces, materials, and time periods. By building a contemporary structure the character of the existing buildings is enhanced by the contrast rather than trivialized by imitation or replication.

This is clearly a comparative advantage of cooperatives over conventional firms’ (ibid., p. 11), as long as organizations maintain some sort of exchange between the internal systems of the organization and the external world through bringing in new ideas, resources, and individuals [44].|$|E

Reed is a natural building materials that possess many useful benefits in contemporary building practices. Reeds grow around lakes, swamps and other water canals and have no environmental impact if dismantled after construction as they are biodegradable. Reeds are also easy to cut and handle making for a flexible material easily used in construction. Similar to several other building traditions, reed construction is disappearing {{in many parts of the}} world, especially now that there are no serious preservation or documentation attempts. In Egypt, this ancient and traditional <b>building</b> <b>craft</b> has been common for millennia, and was the predominant building technique in certain regions until recently. As previously the dwellings and the communal prayer areas of several fishing villages in Egypt were entirely built using reeds, there is still great potential for reintroducing reed building techniques to respond to different environmental and economical conditions in specific regions. This research paper demonstrates how we can revitalize this craft through learning how to use reeds as a low carbon contemporary building practice...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{quantitative}} risk assessment, risk {{is expressed}} {{as a function of}} the hazard, the elements at risk and the vulnerability. From a natural sciences perspective, vulnerability is defined as the expected degree of loss for an element at risk as a consequence of a certain event. The resulting value is dependent on the impacting process intensity and the susceptibility of the elements at risk, and ranges from 0 (no damage) to 1 (complete destruction). With respect to debris flows, the concept of vulnerability ? though widely acknowledged ? did not result in any sound quantitative relationship between process intensities and vulnerability values so far, even if considerable loss occurred during recent years. To close this gap and establish this relationship, data from a well-documented debris flow event in the Austrian Alps was used to derive a quantitative vulnerability function applicable to buildings located on the fan of the torrent. The results suggest a second order polynomial function to fit best to the observed damage pattern. Vulnerability is highly dependent on the construction material used for exposed elements at risk. The buildings studied within the test site were constructed by using brick masonry and concrete, a typical design in post- 1950 s <b>building</b> <b>craft</b> in alpine countries. Consequently, the presented intensity-vulnerability relationship is applicable to this construction type within European mountains.

40|$|As {{understood}} popularly, vernacular is {{not just}} a simplistic interaction between the climate, culture and craft, but rather a composite body of knowledge processes developed over generations of experience through trial and error in response to the needs of people occupying them and to the requirements of the changing physical environment around them. With the hegemonic advent of present global monoculture, the evocation of sentimental vernacular seems quite a natural response in places with strong cultural traditions and their unique craft expressions. I am referring to that nostalgia for the vernacular which is being conceived as an overdue return to the ethos of popular culture. Rather than the critical perception of reality and creative synthesis, it rather evokes the sublimation of a desire for direct experience through imagery and rhetorical information. Its tactical aim is to attain, as economically as possible, a preconceived level of instant gratification in behavioristic terms.

40|$|During {{the time}} of total {{standard}} expansion the architects, except those few working for the institutions of standard engineering, {{were not involved in}} housing design. There was no need to engage many architects, taking into account stable standard regulations of the types 445 (according to the number of habitable rooms) of flats. Working out of individual projects was ordered by Moscow and bore exclusive nature. The professional school was degrading. Then, all of a sudden, the state monopoly collapsed, and the building business was filled by a flow of unskilled employees, who now have to learn from their personal experience and to master this most complicated type of architectural and <b>building</b> <b>craft.</b> The usable area of a standard flat was calculated up to the fractions of a square meter. Now, when the builder and the architect became face to face with each other, and the first one does not quite know what he wants, and the second one 4 what he can, a number of square meters of unusable area are freely roaming around the flats, being passed off as an elite feature. The sense of planning and the pleasure in this occupation will come in the course of time, in the second turn though, because now, in revenge on the standard austerity, the creative fancies are usually performed on the facades. And it often seems that a standard house is more honest and perfect with respect to the great architecture than the today's individual one. Houses are built rarely and they are expensive in Irkutsk. It is impossible to penetrate into the oddity of such «market». The building business satisfies status quo. And the rest is all right. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues for}} {{the emergence of a new}} materiality in Israeli architecture in the 1950 s, 60 s and 70 s. It examines these decades in an extended historical time frame beginning with the British Mandate for Palestine. Materiality refers to local Israeli socioeconomic and geopolitical conditions. It also reflects the literal use, handling and finishing of materials in architecture. During this period first and second stages are described. The first was shaped by objective circumstances in which architecture operated in response to scarcity and demonstrated a realist attitude, one also embedded in the concept of asceticism. It was manifest in restrained formal gestures, abstention from material extravagance, the use of local materials, and an appeal to rational building procedures. The second stage emerging in the 60 s had a different syntax. The analytical, skeletal frame constructions of the 50 s turned synthetic, monolithic, and earth-bound. Compositions turned sculptural and exuberant. An appeal to the architect’s expressive ingenuity became a recognized design objective. The issue of banality versus extraordinariness in design surfaced at this point. ^ My analysis of materiality is based on the following disciplinary themes: typology, public space, craft, and topography. These were dimensions of a broader search for a situated architecture undertaken by Israeli architects since the 1930 s in which they sought to localize the importation of modern architecture from Europe. Typology offered an opportunity to synthesize modern building practices with vernacular models. It revealed the reciprocal interchange between cultures. Architects and planners perceived public space as a means to consolidate new communities, and represent the collective ethos of the new nation. Public space regained its value as a structural constituent in built fabrics. <b>Building</b> <b>craft</b> and use of local materials made architecture place-specific, of-its-time. Topographical awareness, and the mutual inscription between building and setting represented an ongoing desire to overcome the lack of an unmediated connection between the immigrants and their old/new territorial home. These disciplinary themes address a variety of scales from detail, building, neighborhood, city, and region. They demonstrate how Israeli architects adjusted the modernist appeal to abstraction and universalism with a perceptive recognition of their concrete reality. ...|$|E
