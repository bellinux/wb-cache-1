5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> his contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{attracted}} criticism from local residents. A parish council meeting in October 2001 revealed that Arsenal players {{had not been}} involved with local initiatives, despite claims during its planning phase that the ground would allow the club to develop links with the local community. Shenley Primary School reportedly failed to receive any visits from players despite repeated requests. The club responded <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds. Plans to develop new buildings and road links to the site were challenged by residents four years later; they believed {{it would lead to}} increased traffic and noise pollution in the area.|$|E
5|$|Disobeying {{his orders}} {{to return to}} Spithead, Walker made for Cadiz, {{gathered}} the convoy, and escorted them to Britain. It was a controversial action. The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth £1 million, {{and would have been}} at considerable risk from enemy vessels were it not for Walker's escort. However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed, arresting five of Trustys officers while she was at Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant's money out of the port, and demanding Walker be court-martialled. Walker justified himself <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> the imminent alliance between France and Spain, but despite the Lords of the Admiralty being sympathetic to his cause, he was found guilty of disobeying orders, and was dismissed from the navy. The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port. There it was suggested that he wait in Britain, and with the Spanish declaration of war, Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council.|$|E

5|$|It appears, however, {{that direct}} {{trade with the}} Sogdians {{remained}} limited {{in light of the}} small amount of Roman and Byzantine coins found in Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era. Although Roman embassies apparently reached Han China from 166 AD onwards, and the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen (2012) wrote that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 330 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. However, Warwick Ball (2016) upends this notion <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> a hoard of sixteen Roman coins found at Xi'an, China (formerly Chang'an), dated to the reigns of various emperors from Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD). The earliest gold solidus coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to thirteen-hundred silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage {{over the course of the}} 7th century. The fact that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans confirms the pre-eminent importance of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E

25|$|Dutch Republic's weaknesses: The Dutch Republic was too weak; it {{required}} {{a strong and}} stable head of state, which the Orange-Nassau stadtholders and later kings and queens were able provide.

25|$|On May 18, 2004, Provincial Finance Minister Greg Sorbara {{released}} the McGuinty government's first budget. The centrepiece was a controversial new Health Premium of $300 to $900, staggered according to income. This violated a key Liberal campaign {{pledge not to}} raise taxes, and gave the government an early reputation for breaking promises. The Liberals defended the premium <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> the previous government's hidden deficit of $5.6 billion, and McGuinty claimed he needed to break his campaign pledge on taxation to fulfill his promises on other fronts.|$|E
25|$|The SWOC {{signed up}} {{thousands}} of members and absorbed {{a number of}} company unions at U.S. Steel and elsewhere, but did not attempt the sort of daring strike that the UAW had pulled off against GM. Instead Lewis was able to extract a collective bargaining agreement from U.S. Steel, which had previously been an implacable enemy of unions, <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> the chaos and loss of business that GM had suffered by fighting the UAW.

25|$|But {{advocates of}} the guild model argue that the union is {{laying the groundwork for}} {{long-term}} growth. The union is not only gaining members which enable it to advocate for changes in federal labor law to permit the unionization of independent contractors.

In the meantime, supporters say, OPEIU gains some additional dues income and is able to enhance its bargaining status with insurers and other vendors <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> a larger membership base.|$|E

25|$|University of Oxford {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{reviewed the}} book, concentrating his criticism on Behe's claim that random mutation, rather than nonrandom natural selection, was {{the driving force}} behind evolution.

Dawkins also states that Behe had failed to connect with the scientific research on his topic, that Behe's work would not pass the peer-review of a scientific journal and that Behe bypassed the peer-review process by publishing a popular book solely for a public, rather than scientific, audience.|$|E
25|$|One such {{dialogue}} of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was the Meno. The participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, {{and one of}} Meno's slave boys. The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught. Socrates responds by stating {{that he does not}} know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; to wit, he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> inconsistencies and circular arguments.|$|E
