40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of interrelation between constitution, content of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> and physical readiness of adolescents. The theoretical analysis showed that the somatic type significantly influences motor development of the person. Besides, it is an indicator of a reserve of an athletic ability in practice of physical education and sports training. The accounting of content of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> of the person is important for obtaining objective data about an individual type of the person. The bioelectric impedance analysis is the most operational and high-informative method of an assessment of content of <b>body</b> <b>components.</b> Schoolchildren of the 7 th grades of secondary school (n= 24) have taken part in the research. The assessment of somatic type of the adolescents was held by means of an index of Rorer. The analysis of content of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> it was carried out by means of a complex of hardware with the software «Diamant». Physical readiness of the adolescents was studied by means of motor tests. Also methods of mathematical statistics were used. Results of research showed that essential gender distinctions exist and female persons decrease in body weight. Our research hasn’t revealed significant interrelations between content of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> and physical readiness of the adolescents.

40|$|Differential {{growth of}} <b>body</b> <b>components</b> among coexisting {{passerine}} species {{in response to}} nest predation risk Chairperson: Dr. Thomas E. Martin Environmental sources of mortality can exert strong selection pressures on growth strategies across taxa. Studies of growth responses need to consider multiple <b>body</b> <b>components</b> because components can compete for resources during growth in an integrated growth strategy. However, such studies are lacking and {{little is known about}} the extent to which <b>body</b> <b>components</b> may differ in their growth responses to environmental selection pressures. Theory predicts that growth of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> with relatively higher advantages for survival should be prioritized. For example, increases in time dependent mortality, like nest predation risk in birds, should favor growth of body features that enhance the ability to leave nests earlier. We studied 12 coexisting species of passerines to specifically test predictions that species with higher nest predation rates would prioritize growth of locomotor components (e. g. tarsi and wings) at the expense of growth of body mass. We also tested the predictio...|$|R

50|$|Excess {{carbohydrates}} in {{the body}} are converted to palmitic acid. Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major <b>body</b> <b>component</b> of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21-30% (molar) of human depot fat, {{and it is a}} major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk. Palmitate negatively feeds back on acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which in turn is used to add to the growing acyl chain, thus preventing further palmitate generation. In biology, some proteins are modified by the addition of a palmitoyl group in a process known as palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is important for membrane localisation of many proteins.|$|E
50|$|The main central plaque {{component}} is coiled-coil protein Spc42p (for spindle pole <b>body</b> <b>component)</b> {{also found to}} be a part of satellite, that forms a core crystal of SPB. The Spc42p protein is involved in initiation of SPB assembly and its duplication. The Spc42p associates with Spc110p and Spc29p, two other essential coiled-coil proteins that localize to the nuclear face of the SPB. Spc110 localizes to the central plaque and is thought to bind to Spc29p and calmodulin (Cmd1p). The role of Spc110p is a spacer molecule between the central and inner plaque and γ-tubilin complex binding protein. The essential function of calmodulin is at the SPB where it has been proposed to regulate binding of Spc110p to Spc29p. Spc29 forms in the central plaque a repeating structure. Spc98p and Spc97p are two similar yeast γ -tubulin (Tub4p) binding proteins required for microtubule nucleation. Spc98p, Spc97p and Tub4p are found at the inner and outer plaques of SPB and are involved in microtubules organization. Spc42 faces the cytoplasm and binds to coiled-coil Cnm67p (chaotic nuclear migration). Cnm67p forms dimers and functions as a spacer between IL2 and IL1. Cnm67 binds to the outer plaque protein Nud1p, a SPB protein required for exit from mitosis. Another coiled-coil protein, Spc72p, is also found in the outer plaque. Spc72p associates with Nud1p and to components of the γ-tubulin complex.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1995, the NSX-T with a {{removable}} targa top {{was introduced in}} Japan as a special order option and in North America in March 1995. The NSX-T replaced the standard coupe entirely in North America as the only version available post 1994 and all NSXs thereafter were in targa form with the notable exceptions of the Zanardi Special Edition NSX in 1999 {{and a handful of}} special order post-1997/pre-2002 3.2-litre coupes. The European market continued to offer both body styles. The removable roof resulted in decreased chassis rigidity and Honda added about 100 pounds (45 kg) of structural reinforcements to compensate, including significantly thicker frame sidesill rocker panels (the <b>body</b> <b>component</b> which contributes most to the chassis's rigidity), bulkheads, roof pillars and the addition of new front/rear bulkhead and floorpan crossmembers. The targa models, produced {{for the rest of the}} NSX's production run thru 2005, sacrificed weight and some of the original coupe's chassis rigidity in return for an open cockpit driving experience. In addition to this major change, all subsequent NSX-Ts (1995-2001) had smaller-diameter front sway bars, slightly stiffer front springs, softer rear springs and firmer shock-dampers to improve ride comfort and tire wear while reducing the tendency towards oversteer common in mid-engined vehicles. All roofs post 1995 were now body-coloured instead of black, although in Japan, the two-tone black roof/body colour was still available as an optional feature. A lighter version of the variable ratio electric assisted power steering rack, previously found exclusively in the automatic transmission equipped NSXs, became standard on all models. Starting in 1995 the 5-speed transmission's second gear ratio was lowered by 4.2% to improve driveability and provide better response and automatic transmissions received an optional Formula One-inspired Sport Shift with a unique steering column mounted electronic shifter. Manual transmission cars received an improved Torque Reactive limited-slip differential - when combined with a new Throttle-By-Wire system, increased corner exit speeds by 10%. Other innovations beginning in 1995 included a new and lighter exhaust and muffler configuration for greater efficiency and lower emissions, an OBD-II onboard diagnostic system, improvements in the Traction Control System (TCS) and newly developed fuel injectors.|$|E

Series of new glycosides with unusual structural features were described in E. fraudatrix, which allow clarifying the biosynthesis of these compounds. Comparison of the triterpene glycosides contents from the five different <b>body</b> <b>components</b> revealed that the profiles of triterpene glycosides were qualitatively similar, and only some quantitative variabilities for minor compounds were observed...|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{differences}} in morphology, ranging from subtle to extravagant, occur commonly in many animal species. These differences can encompass overall body size (sexual size di-morphism, SSD) or the size and/or shape of specific body parts (sexual <b>body</b> <b>component</b> di-morphism, SBCD). Interacting forces {{of natural and}} sexual selection shape much of the expression of dimorphism we see, though non-adaptive processes may be involved. Differ-ential scaling of individual features can result when selection favors either exaggerated (positive allometry) or reduced (negative allometry) size during growth. Studies of sexual di-morphism and character scaling rely on multivariate models that ideally use an unbiased reference character as an overall measure of body size. We explored several candidate ref-erence characters in a cryptically dimorphic taxon, Hadrurus arizonensis. In this scorpion, essentially every <b>body</b> <b>component</b> among the 16 we examined {{could be interpreted as}} di-morphic, but identification of SSD and SBCD depended on which character was used as the reference (prosoma length, prosoma area, total length, principal component 1, or meta-soma segment 1 width).

40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} {{of automotive}} <b>body</b> <b>components</b> in press lines is a sensitive process. The quality characteristics of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> vary. These fluctuations {{are rooted in}} the fact that the factors influencing the component quality are varying, e. g., fluctuations of batches regarding material quality, abrasion or heating of the tool during the production cycle. If a certain quality characteristic exceeds a predefined range an intervention in the process is necessary. This intervention is based upon the subjective know-how of the machine operator. Objective information about the state of the process, like tool temperature or the material quality of the semi-finished product is not available. Therefore, a lack of knowledge emerges in the interrelations between the tuning parameters of the system press-tool and the component quality during different stages of the process (material quality, temperature…). In this paper a complete concept for an automatic process control in press shops is described. The concept will be realized in a pilot plant for mass production in the press shop of AUDI AG. The mechanisms of occurrence of quality defects are shown in the paper, as well as the essential factors influencing the quality during the mass production of <b>body</b> <b>components</b> in the automotive industry and their variation.
