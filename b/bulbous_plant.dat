60|$|Passing through Assaiboo {{they entered}} the thick bush. The giant cotton trees had now shed their light {{feathery}} foliage, resembling that of an acacia, and the straight, round, even trunks looked like the skeletons of some giant or primeval vegetation rising above the sea of foliage below. White lilies, pink flowers of a <b>bulbous</b> <b>plant,</b> clusters of yellow acacia blossoms, occasionally brightened the roadside, {{and some of the}} old village clearings were covered with a low bush bearing a yellow blossom, and convolvuli white, buff, and pink. The second night the party slept at Accroful, and the next day marched through Dunquah. This was a great store station, but the white troops were not to halt there. It had been a large town, but the Ashantis had entirely destroyed it, as well as every other village between the Prah and the coast. Every fruit tree in the clearing had also been destroyed, and at Dunquah they had even cut down a great cotton tree which was looked upon as a fetish by the Fantis. It had taken them seven days' incessant work to overthrow this giant of the forest.|$|E

50|$|In {{some areas}} of the tropics, {{rainfall}} is interspersed with periods of dryness; more than one wet/dry cycle may occur in a year. <b>Bulbous</b> <b>plants</b> in these areas are adapted to warm, wet periods followed by warm, dry periods. They typically flower near the beginning of the rainy season. Such a climate occurs in Kenya, which has wet conditions in October to December and then again in February to May. Glory-lilies (Gloriosa) and Crinum species are examples of <b>bulbous</b> <b>plants</b> adapted to these conditions. Tropical Asia has similarly adapted <b>bulbous</b> <b>plants,</b> such as species of Hedychium (gingers).|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the morphological identification of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) on <b>bulbous</b> <b>plants</b> in the Taurus Mountains in Turkey. Thirteen soil samples and bulbous roots were taken from the rhizosphere of <b>bulbous</b> <b>plants.</b> The soils were analyzed for the number of VAM spores and chemical and physical properties. In addition, the roots were examined for infection levels, and morphological identification of VAM spores was made. All tested plants are considered mycorrhizal plants. We determined three spore species (Glomus mosseae, Glomus hoi and Scutellospora calospora) from the surveyed soils. The spore distribution rates were as follows: G. Mossea 61. 54 %, G. Hoi 23. 07 % and Scutellospora calospora 15. 38 %. Results suggest that VAM fungal spores and root colonization display variation in rhizosphere under <b>bulbous</b> <b>plants</b> in different ecological conditions...|$|R
