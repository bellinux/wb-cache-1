50|$|The {{blood of}} {{horseshoe}} crabs contains {{one type of}} blood cell, the amebocytes. These {{play an important role}} in the defense against pathogens.

50|$|Limulus {{amebocyte}} lysate (LAL) is an {{aqueous extract}} of blood cells (amoebocytes) from the Atlantic horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus.

5000|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain. Suspected causes include {{abnormal}} responses to bacteria or <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin,</b> or a hypersensitivity to food.

40|$|A {{positive}} {{limulus amebocyte lysate}} (LAL) {{test has}} been considered specific {{for the presence of}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins.</b> The present studies indicated that a variety of compounds such as thrombin, thromboplastin, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid [poly (I). poly (C) ], polyriboadenylic-polyribouridylic acid [poly (A) 'poly (U) ] and ribonuclease all resulted in a positive LAL test. In addition, two other pyrogenic compounds, human leukocytic pyrogen and dextrans, reacted negatively in this assay. When <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> are known to be present, the LAL test remains the most sensitive assay for their measurement. However, it is essential to take the nonspecificity of the reaction into account when interpreting positive LAL tests of unknown solutions. The gelation of lysate of amebocytes of Limulus (LAL) has been used to detect minute quantities of <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> in biological and commer-cial fluids [1, 2].

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that the development}} of irreversibility in shock initiated by trauma or hemorrhage is mediated primarily by a breakdown of bacterial defense mechanisms and an attendant vasculo-toxic sequela. The validity of this thesis rests in large part on experiments in dogs and rabbits (1, 2) in which pretreatment with antibiotics successfully circumvented the fatal consequences of a standardized episode of hemorrhagic shock. Further support has been derived from indirect evidence: a decreased tolerance to <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> (3), a fall in blood properdin levels (4), and an impaired capacity to clear bacteria from the bloodstream {{during the course of the}} shock reactions (5). The pathophysiologic alterations produced by <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> have been shown in recent experiments (6, 7) to be strikingly similar to the vascular manifestations of the shock syndromes produced by hemorrhage and trauma. Moreover, animals rendered tolerant to <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> by repeated exposure to these extracts were found to be resistant to both hemorrhagic and traumatic shock...|$|R
50|$|A {{prime example}} of such a foreign ligand is <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin,</b> whose effects have been known for generations.

50|$|Fred Bang {{reported}} in 1956 that gram-negative bacteria, even if killed, {{will cause the}} blood of the horseshoe crab to turn into a semi-solid mass.

50|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{attempts to}} explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.

Exposure to <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin</b> in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction. Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop and {{validate}} methods for quantifying endotoxins on surfaces and in {{the air of the}} manufacturing environment of injectable drugs, in order to use them to evaluate the quality of the process and the risk for the products processed therein. The method for recovering endotoxins from surfaces is a direct method that provides sampling surfaces by swabbing and extraction of endotoxins from the swabs with an appropriate diluent, while the method for airborne endotoxins provides an air-active sampling on a glass fiber filter and endotoxins extraction with an appropriate diluent. LAY ABSTRACT: <b>Bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> are present in the environments devoted to the manufacturing of injectable drugs and could be a real risk for the quality and the safety of such drugs.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of tolerance to the pyrogenic activity of Gram-negative <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins</b> {{is most often}} attributed to a non-specific increase in {{the activity of the}} reticuloendothelial system (RES) (1). Recently, it was shown that Group A streptococcal exotoxins produced biphasic fever responses in rabbits (2). In contrast to the non-specific tolerance induced by endotoxins, three distinct toxins were identified based on their ability to induce specific pyrogenic tolerance; in addition, the pyrogenic activity was neutralized specifically with antiserum. These observations suggested that, in addition to the non-specific RES activity, specific immune mechanisms may contribute to pyrogenic tolerance to Gram-negative <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxins.</b> Because endotoxins from organisms of different species and families induce non-specific pyrogenic tolerance, it is assumed that specific immunological mechanisms are not involved. If, however, there exist unsuspected common or cross-reactive antigens contributing to the pyrogenic activity, the non-specific nature of the mechanism would b...|$|R
50|$|The protein {{contains}} a single 175- residue polypeptide chain; this is cleaved after Arg-18 and Arg-46 by a clotting enzyme {{contained in the}} hemocyte and activated by a <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin</b> (lipopolysaccharide). Cleavage releases two chains of coagulin, A and B, linked by two disulphide bonds, together with the peptide C. Gel formation results from interlinking of coagulin molecules. Secondary structure prediction suggests the C peptide forms an alpha- helix, which is released during the proteolytic conversion of coagulogen to coagulin gel. The beta-sheet structure and 16 half-cystines found in the molecule appear to yield a compact protein stable to acid and heat.|$|E
5000|$|Byssinosis, {{also called}} [...] "brown lung disease" [...] or [...] "Monday fever", is an {{occupational}} lung disease caused by exposure to cotton dust in inadequately ventilated working environments. Byssinosis commonly occurs in workers who are employed in yarn and fabric manufacture industries. It is now thought that the cotton dust directly causes the disease and some believe that the causative agents are endotoxins that come from the cell walls of gram negative bacteria that grow on the cotton. Although <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin</b> is a likely cause, the absence of similar symptoms in workers in other industries exposed to endotoxins makes this uncertain.|$|E

Therefore, it is possible that vitamin deficiency, caloric deprivation, alcohol abuse, and infectious disease status can all have compounded effects with mycotoxins. In turn, mycotoxins have the potential for both acute and chronic health effects via ingestion, skin contact, and inhalation. These toxins can enter the blood stream and lymphatic system; they inhibit protein synthesis, damage macrophage systems, inhibit particle clearance of the lung, and increase sensitivity to <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin.</b>|$|E

Binding of molecules uniquely found in microbes—viral glycoproteins, viral RNA, <b>bacterial</b> <b>endotoxin</b> (lipopolysaccharide), bacterial flagella, CpG motifs—by pattern recognition receptors, such as membrane bound Toll like receptors or the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I or MDA5, can trigger release of IFNs.Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) is important for inducing interferons {{in response to}} the presence of double-stranded RNA viruses; the ligand for this receptor is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). After binding dsRNA, this receptor activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which are important for initiating synthesis of many inflammatory proteins. RNA interference technology tools such as siRNA or vector-based reagents can either silence or stimulate interferon pathways. Release of IFN from cells (specifically IFN-γ in lymphoid cells) is also induced by mitogens. Other cytokines, such as interleukin 1, interleukin 2, interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor and colony-stimulating factor, can also enhance interferon production.|$|E
