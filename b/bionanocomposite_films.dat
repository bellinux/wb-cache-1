40|$|Nanocellulose (NC) were {{extracted}} from the Moroccan Alfa plant (Stipa tenacissima L.) and characterised. These Alfa cellulosic nanoparticles were used as reinforcing phase to prepare <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> using carboxymethyl cellulose as matrix. These films were obtained by the casting/evaporation method. The crystallinity of NC was analysed by X-ray diffraction, the dimension of NC by atomic force microscopy, molecular interactions due to incorporation of NC in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) matrix were supported by Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The properties of the ensuing <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> were investigated using tensile tests, water vapour permeability (WVP) study and thermogravimetric analysis. With the progress of purification treatment of cellulose, the crystallinity is improved compared to the untreated fibres; this {{can be explained by}} the disappearance of the amorphous areas in cellulose chain of the plant. Consequently, the tensile modulus and tensile strength of CMC film increased by 60 and 47 %, respectively, in the <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> with 10 wt% of NC, and decrease by 8. 6 % for WVP with the same content of NC. The NC obtained from the Moroccan Alfa fibres can be used as a reinforcing agent for the preparation of bionanocomposites, and they have a high potential for the development of completely biodegradable food packaging materials...|$|E

Poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) was used to increase PLA crystallinity. The thermal stability of the PLA-PHB blends was improved {{by the addition of}} 5 wt% of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) or modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) synthesized from microcrystalline cellulose. The combination of ATBC and cellulose nanocrystals, mainly the better dispersed CNCs, improved the interaction between PLA and PHB.

The modified electrode exhibited excellent analytical performance with wide linear range, low detection limit, and good selectivity for measuring glucose.

The nanocrystals were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, whereas the bionanocomposites properties were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile measurements, water solubility, swelling behavior, and water activity (aw). The water resistance properties (solubility and swelling behavior) of the nanocomposites were enhanced {{with the addition}} of cellulose nanofillers. These results were explained in terms of the high crystallinity of the nanocrystals and the formation of a rigid network with the nanofillers, which provide physical barriers to the permeation of water within the hydrophilic cassava matrix. The addition of CNCs in the bionanocomposites decreases aw linearly, reaching values below 0. 5 (for CNCs concentration higher than 4 wt%), a reference value for no microbial proliferation for food product design. The presence of small concentrations of CNCs (0. 1 – 0. 3 wt%) also effectively increased the maximum tensile strength (more than 90 %) and elastic modulus (more than 400 %), indicating the formation of a suitable percolation network in this concentration range. Because the cellulose nanofillers enhanced the mechanical and water stability properties of the nanocomposites, the obtained results in this work may be applied to the development of biodegradable packaging or coatings to enhance shelf life of food products...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how a {{functional}} <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>film</b> with both antioxidant and antimicrobial activities was successfully prepared by the filling of a pectin matrix with modified Halloysite nanotubes (HNT) containing the essential peppermint oil (PO). Firstly, HNT surfaces were functionalized with cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) molecules with the aim to enhance the affinity of the nanofiller towards PO, which was estimated by means of HPLC experiments. The HNT/CB[6] hybrid was characterized by sev- eral methods (thermogravimetry, FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy) highlighting the influence of the supramolecular interactions on the composition, thermal behavior and morphology of the filler. Then, a pectin + HNT/CB[6] biofilm was prepared by the use of the casting method under specific experimental conditions in order to favor the entrapment of the volatile PO into the nanocomposite struc- ture. Water contact angle measurements, thermogravimetry and tensile tests evidenced the effects of the modified filler on the thermo-mechanical and wettability properties of pectin, which were correlated to the microscopic structure of the biocomposite film. In addition, PO release in food simulant solvent was investigated at different temperatures (4 and 25 ◦ C), whereas the antioxidant activity of the nanocompos- ite film was estimated using the DPPH method. Finally, we studied the in vitro antibacterial activity of the biofilm against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), which were isolated by beef and cow milk, respectively. These experiments were carried out at specific temperatures (4, 37 and 65 ◦ C) that can be useful for a multi-step food conservation.

The <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> (ĸCRG/HNT) were successfully prepared having optimum tensile properties at 3 wt% of HNT. Morphological and surface analysis of the nanocomposite revealed excellent film formation and increased in surface roughness. Immersion of the film in simulated body fluid for 7 days resulted in the growth of hydroxyl apatite particles with Ca/P ratio of 1. 68. This is a good indication of bioactivity for possible template in bone tissue engineering. Swelling and methylene blue release experiments indicated possible drug delivery applications due to the stability of the ĸCRG matrix up to more than 20 days and delayed release of the model drug, respectively.

30|$|This {{present study}} reports {{the role of}} {{cellulase}} enzyme in the degradation of nanocomposites. The sodium montmorillonite clay content significantly impacted on the rate of CMC solubilization. Biodegradation behavior of films depends {{on the content of}} nanoparticles, and the decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-S-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 4 to 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero, as no saccharides and other compounds leached to the solution, as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. MMT (0 % to 5 % w/w film) could decrease the WAC% and DED% of PVA/S/CMC/MMT nanocomposite films compared to the PVA/S/CMC films. Considering these results, it seems that the PVA/S/CMC/MMT <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> show better physico-chemical properties than PVA/S/CMC films, and they can potentially replace PVA/S/CMC films.|$|E

The nanocomposite masterbatch with 75 wt. % polylactic acid (PLA), 5 wt. % chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) and 20 wt. % glycerol triacetate plasticizer (GTA) was melt compounded and then diluted to 1 wt. % ChNCs with PLA and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) prior to film blowing. The morphological, mechanical, optical, thermal and barrier {{properties of the}} blown nanocomposite films were studied and compared with the reference material without ChNCs. The addition of 1 wt. % ChNCs increased the tear strength by 175 % and the puncture strength by 300 %. Additionally, {{the small amount of}} chitin nanocrystals affected the glass transition temperature (Tg), which increased 4 °C compared with the reference material and slightly enhanced the films degree of crystallinity. The chitin nanocomposite also had lower fungal activity and lower electrostatic attraction between the film surfaces; leading to easy opening of the plastic bags. The barrier and optical properties as well as the thermal degradation of the films were not significantly influenced by the addition of chitin nanocrystals...|$|E

The effect of the addition of glycerol, as a plasticizer, on {{the properties of the}} materials was also evaluated. All bionanocomposites showed considerable improvement in thermal stability and mechanical properties, compared to the unfilled pullulan films, evidenced by the significant increase in the degradation temperature (up to 40 A degrees C) and on both Young's modulus and tensile strength (increments of up to 100 and 50 %, for films without glycerol and up to 8, 000 and 7, 000 % for those plasticized with glycerol).

30|$|The present work {{shows the}} role of MMT in {{physical}} properties and biodegradation of bionanocomposites. An increase in the Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was observed when 1 - 5 % (w/w) of MMT {{was added to the}} PVA/S/CMC. With the increase of the MMT concentration from 0 t o 5 %, the UTS increased 5 from 18.36 to 20.38 MPa, however, the strain to break (SB) decreased noticeably from 35.56 to 5.22 %. The MMT content significantly impacted on the rate of starch solubilistion. The decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 8 – 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. The water uptake ability of blends was decreased significantly as the MMT percentage increased from 0 to 5 % (W/W). At the level of 5 % (W/W) MMT, the films showed the lowest WAC% values and DED% decreased from 27.69 μg/ml h for the film without MMT to 18.95 μg/ml h for that containing 5 % MMT. Based on these results, the PVA:S:CMC:MMT <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> show better physicochemical properties than PVA:S:CMC films and they can be potentially replaced of PVA:S:CMC films.|$|E

Blending with HNTs induced changes in nanotopography and surface chemistry of PVA films. The mechanical properties of PVA were enhanced by the incorporated HNTs. The stain-induced crystallization was confirmed by DSC after tensile test. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblast-like and NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast cells were cultured on neat PVA and PVA/HNTs films to evaluate the effects of surface nanotopography and composition on cell behavior. The observations indicated that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell behavior strongly responded to surface nanotopography. On nanotube-dominant surface, cells exhibited a significantly higher level of adhesion than on neat PVA film, whereas neat PVA showed higher degree of osteoblast proliferation compared with PVA/HNTs. In vitro fibroblasts response demonstrated that both neat PVA and PVA/HNTs nanocomposite films were biocompatible and PVA/HNTs films favored to fibroblasts attach and growth below 7. 5 wt % of HNTs incorporated.

40|$|The optical {{behaviour}} of both {{gold and}} silver nanoparticles has been studied in both experimental and theoretical aspects. In the theoretical part of our thesis, {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of particles of various shapes and configurations, the versatile Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) has been employed to simulate in depth the absorption spectra of single isolated oriented nanoparticles of different symmetry (nanocube, nanobar and nanoellipsoid). The effect of the plasmonic coupling and the size of spherical particles assemblies on their optical response have also been addressed. It was shown that the plasmonic coupling in the interacting particles in close proximity configuration disturbs the homogenous distribution of surface charges and results in splitting the plasmonic band into two bands. The excitations of two different bands (longitudinal and transverse bands) have been also observed in the absorption spectra of many fold symmetry particles. The diversity of the polarization factors along different symmetry axis was established as the main key for observing several bands. Thus the importance of particle shape and the different interesting possibilities offered by this single factor has been well demonstrated in the DDA calculations performed while our treatment of ensembles of nanospheres showed in detail the effect of interacting particles on the overall optical properties of actual samples. In the experimental part of this thesis, a first part is devoted to the study of the influence of dielectric host material on the optical properties of gold nanoparticles. For this purpose, gold, -poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and -gelatin nanocomposite materials have been prepared by an in-situ method. Two reduction methods (photochemical and chemical) were used to reduce the gold salt in the presence of the polymer matrix. Firstly, annealed and non annealed samples were prepared by different photochemical methods (UV-, thermal-, and MW-irradiation). Gold-poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposites were prepared by irradiating spin-coated films containing the polymer and the gold precursor dissolved in acetone. The reduction of gold ions resulted in the formation of gold that nucleated and grew within the polymer films. It was shown that, depending on the energy source, gold nanoparticles with different shapes could be formed. The nanocomposites prepared through the photochemical methods, showed a low sensitivity toward the environment. However, by annealing the samples at temperatures well above the glass transition temperature of the polymer, the response to dielectric environment appeared to be enhanced significantly. The increased sensitivity of the annealed sample (increase the surface particle density) was accounted for by the increased mobility of both polymer chains and gold nanoparticles in the rubbery state of the material and the presence of the monomer. The results showed that, by using adequate post-synthesis heat treatments, gold-polymer nanocomposites could be used as plasmonic sensing platforms. Secondly, gold–gelatin <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> were prepared by the reduction of gold ions by sodium borohydride in an aqueous solution. It was shown that both the solution and the films on glass substrates contained entrapped hydrogen micro- and nanobubbles with diameters in the range of 200 nm– 3 μm. The composite films having micro- and nanobubble inclusions have been found to be very stable. The optical properties of gold nanoparticles in the presence of gelatin and hydrogen nanobubbles were measured and simulated by using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. The calculated localized surface plasmon resonance band was found in agreement with the experimental band position only when the presence of hydrogen bubbles around the gold nanoparticles was taken into account. The different morphological features engendered by the presence of the bubbles in the film (gelatin receptacles for the nanoparticles, gelatin hemispheres raised by the bubbles under the surface, cavities on the surface of the film, etc) are potential candidates for many applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} technological steps of food preservation. Microbial growth and oxidation reactions occurring on food surface are two of the main causes of deterioration of fresh and processed food products. Traditional food packaging generally protect foodstuff from external influences. Whereas active packaging systems interact with the food permitting the extension of their shelf-life and the maintenance, or even the improvement of their quality and sensorial features. The main objective of this thesis is the attainment of knowledge related to the development of new material formulations for food packaging by using suitably modified inorganic nanoparticles in order to obtain a controlled release system of active substances and to improve active film physical and gas barrier performances. As far as antioxidant active films is concerned, the aim of the work is the development of innovative films containing natural -tocopherol adsorbed onto functionalised and not functionalised mesoporous silica particles (SBA- 15; SBA- 15 +APTES) in order to protect it during LDPE film manufacture and to be able to control its release rate. The synthesized mesoporous powders were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and N 2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K. Powders loaded with tocopherol were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Results show that the maximum of the pore size distribution reduces from 90 Å for purely siliceous SBA- 15 to 73 Å for amino-functionalized SBA- 15. Infrared analysis shows that tocopherol interacts with the amino groups of functionalized SBA- 15. It has been also proven that circa 40 % and 30 % of tocopherol is loaded into SBA- 15 and SBA- 15 +APTES respectively. Release tests performed using 96 % v/v ethanol as fatty food stimulant show that the tocopherol diffusivity of films containing functionalized mesoporous silica decreased of about 50 % with respect to films containing free tocopherol, as. This is due to the decrease in the pore size and to the increase in diffusion resistance caused by the functionalization of the internal pore walls with the amino groups. Moreover, the oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) assay of the produced active polymer films proved the antioxidant effectiveness of tocopherol released from samples after manufacturing process. As far as antimicrobial activity is concerned, silver montmorillonite clays have been increasingly investigated as germicidal, bactericidal, antifungal, and antiseptic components in different food packaging formulation. The aim of this thesis is the development of a new class of antimicrobial systems in which the inorganic phyllosilicate clays (MMT) have been used as support for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The Ag-MMT filler consists of nanometric metallic silver and oxides particles (size in the range 2 - 40 nm) preferentially located on the surface of MMT single lamellae as the UV adsorption and FT-IR spectra showed. Antimicrobial bionanocomposites have been obtained by solution casting of AgMMT particles into chitosan, one of the most interesting biopolymers obtained from natural sources. The combined effect of glycerol and AgMMT particles on the thermal, structural and barrier properties of the obtained bionanocomposites was investigated. In fact, the plasticizer and the silver ions as well as the surface of metallic particles exert a combined effect which allows a reduction of the liquid water uptake and water permeability with respect to neat chitosan. Indeed, X. Ray results revealed that Ag-MMT particles result partially intercalated by chitosan macromolecules although it cannot be excluded in such an extent the exfoliation due to the collapse of MMT structure during the preparation of the active filler. Moreover, considering that the antibacterial mechanism of silver is mainly related to the action of silver ions and metallic AgNPs, the silver release kinetics from bionanocomposites in water at 25 °C were also investigated. In conclusion, samples of purely siliceous and amino-functionalized SBA- 15 mesoporous silica were successfully used as α-tocopherol carriers for the production of active LDPE polymer films. In fact, active polymer films containing the functionalized carrier showed a slower tocopherol release when compared to samples containing free tocopherol and tocopherol loaded onto purely siliceous substrate. Whereas, for antimicrobial active film,. the silver supporting nanoparticles, Ag-MMT, contribute to modulate the release kinetics of silver ions from <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> over a longer time interval (up to 20 days). This is of paramount importance for the production of active films to be used as food packaging materials or potentially as biomaterials...|$|E
