5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a religious <b>bigot.</b> They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens is now {{considered}} a multi-purpose recreational horse that is also attached to the cultural identity of the Ariege region. They are used for leisure and competitive trail riding. They are consistently ranked in the French national competitive trail riding championships, and in 1998, a Mérens {{finished second in the}} European Championships. In 1998, Stéphane <b>Bigot</b> made a crossing of the Pyrenees on a Mérens. Many tourist facilities now offer guided trail rides through the mountains of Ariege on Mérens horses, with some centers having a stable consisting entirely of members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a <b>bigot</b> nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the day {{the chase}} continued, the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as {{darkness}} fell Pique closed with the larger French ship. At 23:00 Milne {{was close enough to}} open fire on Seine, to which <b>Bigot</b> responded without reducing speed. For the next {{two and a half hours}} the frigates exchanged broadsides at full speed as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead. At 01:35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, Seine pulling away from the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E
5|$|For French {{warships}} oceanic {{travel was}} extremely hazardous and ships often travelled in numbers. In {{the spring of}} 1796 a squadron commanded by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey had sailed from Rochefort to reinforce French naval forces in the Indian Ocean, based at Port Louis on the Île de France. Sercey's squadron failed to make a significant impression, driven off from the East Indies in an inconclusive action off Sumatra, and then tricked into fleeing from a vulnerable East India Company merchant convoy in the Bali Strait Incident in January 1797. By {{the end of the}} year the Colonial Assembly, which were unhappy with plans of the French Directory to abolish slavery, refused to continue supplying the squadron and garrison, forcing Sercey to disperse his ships. First Régénérée and Vertu were ordered back to France, and then in early 1798 the 40-gun Seine was instructed to follow them, carrying 280 soldiers from the garrison no longer supported by the Colonial Assembly. Seine, still commanded by Lieutenant Julien-Gabriel <b>Bigot</b> following the death of Captain Latour off Sumatra in 1796, sailed on 24 March, overcrowded with the stores and dependents accompanying the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart before him, Mendelssohn was {{regarded}} as a child prodigy. He began taking piano lessons from his mother when he was six, and at seven was tutored by Marie <b>Bigot</b> in Paris. After the family moved to Berlin, all four Mendelssohn children studied piano with Ludwig Berger, who was himself a former student of Muzio Clementi. From at least May 1819 Felix (and his sister Fanny) studied counterpoint and composition with Carl Friedrich Zelter in Berlin. This was an important influence on his future career. Zelter had almost certainly been recommended as a teacher by his aunt Sarah Levy, who had been a pupil of W. F. Bach and a patron of C. P. E. Bach. Sarah Levy was a talented keyboard player in her own right, often playing with Zelter's orchestra at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, of which she and the Mendelssohn family were leading patrons. Sarah had formed an important collection of Bach family manuscripts which she bequeathed to the Singakademie; Zelter, whose tastes in music were conservative, was also an admirer of the Bach tradition. This undoubtedly played a significant part in forming Felix Mendelssohn's musical tastes. His works show his study of Baroque and early classical music. His fugues and chorales especially reflect a tonal clarity and use of counterpoint reminiscent of Johann Sebastian Bach, by whose music he was deeply influenced.|$|E

25|$|According {{to colonial}} era British historians, Tipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus and Christians. According to C. K. Kareem, Tippu Sultan issued an edict for the {{destruction}} of Hindu temples in Kerala. However, he also made regular endowments to Hindus and Hindu institutions in Mysore, including 156 temples. In recent decades, a number of Hindu groups have reviled Tipu Sultan as a <b>bigot</b> who massacred Hindus, arguing that he carry out forced conversions of Hindus and Christians. A number of historians, however, argue that these accounts come from colonial British sources deemed to be unreliable or fabricated as they had a strong vested interest in presenting Tipu as a tyrant from whom the British had liberated Mysore. The portrayal of Tipu Sultan as a religious <b>bigot</b> is disputed, and some sources suggest that he in fact often embraced religious pluralism.|$|E

As the great-granddaughter of a Protestant minister, who was raised by the Abenakis, then converted to Catholicism and embraced French culture, Esther's story was a symbol of the future of French superiority in the New World.|$|E
