The effects of ground height, <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> edge, and jet exit turbulent intensity were assessed, and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using computational fluid dynamics. Turbulence closure was achieved using a k-e model, and the result compared with calculations obtained with a differential stress model. Three <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> edges were tested (rounded, squared, and chamfered), and the ground heights varied from rj = 0. 15 to 0. 8. It was found that flow mechanisms varied significantly with ground heights. A coherent vortex existed between the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the ground at the}} low ground heights (17 0. 25), the vortex disappeared and separation at the plate edge played an important part in determining the lift loss.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{triangular}} {{design of a}} solar water heater not only enhances the overall gain to the system but also improves the natural convection between the absorbing plate and the water, leading to better performance of the system. A night insulation cover is used at the top surface of the heater to reduce the losses from the system during the off-sunshine hours. Another {{way to reduce the}} losses from the system is by using an insulating <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> in the tank. This plate divides the tank water into two portions, the water above this plate is known as the upper column and below is known as the lower column. The water of the two columns is in contact with each other {{with the help of the}} incoming and outgoing vents provided in the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate.</b> This plate also suppresses losses from the lower column during the off-sunshine hours. In this paper, we have studied the effect of a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the performance ofa triangular built-in-storage solar water heater. To obtain the thermal behavior of the system, the energy balance quations are written at the different nodes, and the well-known finite difference forward time step marching technique is used for their solution. The proposed system is studied by varying the vent area, the water mass in the two columns and under a constant flow rate for different durations. The effects of the thermal conductivity and thickness of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the water temperature are also investigated. It is found that the presence of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> greatly improves the system performance during off-sunshine hours...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{of a high}} temperature shell and tube heat exchanger and chemical decomposer (thereafter — heat exchanger) with straight tube configuration have been performed using Fluent 6. 2. 16 code to examine flow distribution on the tube side. The heat exchanger can {{be a part of}} sulfur iodine thermochemical water splitting cycle {{which is one of the}} most studied cycles for hydrogen production. Uniformity of the flow distribution in the heat exchanger is very critical because the flow maldistribution among the tube or shell sides can result in decreasing of chemical decomposition and increasing of pumping power. In the current study the flow rate uniformity in the heat exchanger tubes has been investigated. Simulations of the straight tube configuration, tube configuration with <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> arrangement and with pebble bed region inside the tubes were performed to examine flow distribution on the tube side. It was found the flow maldistribution along the tube direction is very serious with the simple tube configuration. An improvement of the header configuration has been done by introducing a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> in to the header section. With the introduction of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate,</b> there was a noticeable decrease in the flow maldistribution in the tubes. Uniformity of flow was also investigated with catalytic bed inside the tubes. A significant decrease in flow maldistribution was observed with this arrangement.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of an acoustic radiation mode of a <b>baffled</b> <b>plate,</b> Rayleigh integral with free space Green’s function is involved. The boundary element method (BEM) {{is one of the}} approaches to compute its modes and radiation efficiencies. In this paper a fast multipole BEM in conjunction with an iterative solver based on the implicit restart Arnold method is proposed to efficiently and accurately evaluate acoustic radiation modes and efficiencies. Even though a 3 D free space Green’s function is used here, a quad tree is used for the hierarchical tree structure of the boundary mesh instead of an oct tree, which can speed up the fast multipole BEM. Similar to the analytical integration of moment evaluations, the analytical integration is also employed to compute the local expansion coefficients which further improves the efficiency of the fast multipole BEM for {{the analysis}} of an acoustic radiation mode of <b>baffled</b> <b>plates.</b> Comparison between numerical and theoretical radiation efficiencies of a <b>baffled</b> circular <b>plate</b> vibrating as a piston shows that the fast multipole BEM proposed here can give results with very good accuracy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to improve the design of a cylindrical water supply tank in order to achieve better displacement efficiency of old water in a cylindrical tank. The present paper describes the results of an experimental study of the flow pattern and the residual concentration of old water in a tank. The effect of the shapes of the inlet and outlet pipes on the displacement efficiency of old water in the tank was investigated. The displacement efficiency of old water in a tank that has inlet and outlet pipes {{at one end of the}} tank (Type 2) is better than that in a tank that has inlet and outlet pipes at the center of the tank (Type 1). The displacement efficiency of water inside the tank that has an inlet pipe with a diverging nozzle and an outlet pipe with a circular <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> (Type 5) is better than that of the other tank.

The warmest storage layer is the top storage cylinder and below this there are colder storage layers through natural layering. The water is fed into different storage levels, depending on the available feed temperature and current temperature layering.
