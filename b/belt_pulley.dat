2500|$|Power {{take-off}} (PTO) was {{integral to}} the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an [...] <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." [...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E

50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> was a U.S.-based {{magazine}} {{dedicated to}} antique farm tractors of all brands and makes. It published successfully for over 2 decades {{and was one}} of the best known titles in the category. It was a family business run first by the Aumann family and then by the Elmore family. In 2009 it was sold, and the new owner eventually changed the name of the publication to Vintage Tractor Digest. This ended its publication under the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> title.|$|E

5000|$|Conditions {{under which}} the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulleys</b> are {{operating}} - The friction between the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulley</b> may decrease substantially if the belt happens to be muddy or wet, as it may act as a lubricant between the surfaces. This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in the belt, nominally making friction greater.|$|R

5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via flat <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys.</b> The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original flat <b>belts</b> and <b>pulley</b> wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys</b> which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> for a flat belt (which is what <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} few issues of the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine, Kurt Aumann wrote nearly all the {{articles}} contained in each issue. If any inclination toward any one brand of tractor or any one antique farm collectors organization could be perceived in the new publication, {{it would be an}} inclination toward the products of the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. This was a reflection of the close relationship that Kurt Aumann had developed with individual members of the Hart-Parr/Oliver Collectors Association. Nonetheless, the magazine sought to cover the history and the technical data of all makes and brands of antique farm tractors and farm equipment. Toward this end, the magazine announced its intention of establishing a network of the reporters from around the nation to contribute articles. [...] Originally, the writers or contributors to <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine were called [...] "Reporters." [...] An early list of Reporters for the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine included Ed Westen of Kewaunee, Wisconsin, Jerry Engstrom of Fargo, North Dakota; Richard LaRusso of New Milford, Connecticut; Robert Oliphant of Waterford, Virginia; David Grube of Ringold, Pennsylvania; and Loran Ellingson of Northwood, North Dakota. [...] In 1989, Kevin Talley of Vermillion, South Dakota and Sam Meeker of North Henderson, Illinois were added as reporters. [...] The reporters attended antique tractor shows across the nation and submitted [...] "show reports" [...] to the magazine on the shows they had attended. Humorous reminiscences from Walter M. Buescher, a retired Allis-Chalmers salesman and manager, were featured in a <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> column for several years.|$|E

Organically bonded P/M mixes {{have been}} {{developed}} to improve the stability of dimensional properties by reducing the segregation of the mix constituents and improving the filling characteristics. Robustness and reliability are key factors for the promotion of P/M as cost effective substitute of competing manufacturing technologies. Based on the production of four different <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys,</b> this paper presents the achievement of reduced weight scatter and close dimensional control realizable by using a Starmix TM that is organically bonded...|$|R
50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, <b>belts,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|R
5000|$|A {{patent for}} {{adjustable}} <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> for motorcycles {{dating back to}} 1912, shows Cecil Stanley Burney, Edward Alexander (Alec) Burney, and pioneer aviator Harold Blackburn trading as Burney and Blackburne (not Blackburn), operating from Northchurch, Berkhamsted. They were incorporated shortly afterwards as Burney and Blackburn Ltd, at which point Harold Blackburn sold his stake to the competition riders Cecil and Arthur Roberts. As a [...] "dividend" [...] for his investment, Blackburn was given a motorcycle and sidecar from the original production batch. Harold Blackburn used this machine to promote flying displays in Yorkshire.|$|R
5000|$|The Allis-Chalmers Model 6-12 was a farm tractor {{produced}} by Allis-Chalmers between 1918 and 1923. Like many other tractors of the era, its model name came from its horsepower ratings, with 6-12 (or 6/12) meaning 6 hp at the drawbar and 12 hp at the <b>belt</b> <b>pulley.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Field-Marshall {{tractors}} were {{commonly used}} to pull agricultural machinery such as threshing machines from site to site. Once in place, the Field-Marshall would {{be used as the}} powerplant for the threshing machine, the tractor's <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> coupled by a large flat drive belt to the threshing machine's pulley.|$|E

50|$|A {{line shaft}} {{is a power}} driven {{rotating}} shaft for power transmission that was used extensively from the Industrial Revolution until the early 20th century. Prior to {{the widespread use of}} electric motors small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute power from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex. The central power source could be a water wheel, turbine, windmill, animal power or a steam engine. Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of <b>belts,</b> <b>pulleys</b> and gears known as millwork.|$|R
50|$|The former {{engine and}} boiler sheds are {{immediately}} {{north of the}} main shed. Each of these spaces has a concrete slab floor and they are separated by an area of dirt floor. Concrete blocks stand {{to the middle of}} the concrete slab floor of the engine shed. Openings in the wall between the engine shed and the main shed and in the floor of the platform of the main shed indicate access for former shafts, <b>belts,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> ducts and other components of the early steam powered system. A range of equipment, machinery and other items are stored in the engine and boiler sheds.|$|R

50|$|Volkswagen use a {{variator}} {{system with}} two variators, {{one for each}} camshaft. Like the Alfa Romeo system, these are electrically-controlled hydraulic units, mounted in the camshaft's timing <b>belt</b> <b>pulley.</b> These systems are fitted to the Volkswagen VR5 and VR6 engines, and also to the W8 and W12 engines. The multiple-bank W engines have four variators in total, one for each camshaft.|$|E
5000|$|Overall {{design of}} the setup - The setup {{involves}} the initial conditions of the construction, such as the angle which the belt is wrapped around and geometry of the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulley</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The {{tension on}} the pulling side of the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulley</b> {{has the ability to}} {{increase}} exponentially if the magnitude of the belt angle increases (e.g. it is wrapped around the pulley segment numerous times).|$|R
50|$|The first steam powered sawmill in Queensland {{had opened}} in Brisbane in 1853 and prior to World War II most sawmills on the Atherton Tablelands used steam engines. A {{reliable}} {{source of water}} was required for the steam boilers which powered the engines, and the latter were commonly equipped with a large flywheel, as the energy stored in the flywheel enabled the saws to make major cuts with a minimum loss of speed. Power {{was transferred to the}} saws via <b>belts,</b> <b>pulleys</b> and shafts. However, most machinery was sold, relocated and reused when a sawmill closed, leading to paucity of relics at most sawmill sites.|$|R
