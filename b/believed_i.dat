He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection.

Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: [...] "I spoil everything I touch.

500|$|Hill contributed {{her voice}} to the soundtrack for What Happened, Miss Simone?, a 2015 {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Nina Simone, an American singer, pianist, and civil rights activist. Hill was originally supposed to record only two songs for the record, but ended up recording six. She also served as a producer on the compilation alongside Robert Glasper. Hill said of her connection to Simone: [...] "Because I fed on this music ... I <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> always had a right to have a voice. Her example is clearly a form of sustenance to a generation needing to find theirs. What a gift." [...] NPR critically praised Hill's performance on the soundtrack, stating: [...] "This album mainly showcases Lauryn Hill's breadth and dexterity. Not formally marketed as Hill's comeback album, her six tracks here make this her most comprehensive set of studio recordings since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998." ...|$|E
500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> had a really limited range and was going {{to make the most of}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the 25th Infantry Division's Tropic Lightning Museum, 14 {{different}} American {{pilots were}} able to take off during the surprise attack and record 10 Japanese aircraft kills. Air Corps records credit Welch with four kills and Taylor with two, yet new research of Japanese combat reports confirms Taylor got four kills (when the two probable kills are included). Taylor claimed in an interview: [...] "I know for certain I shot down two planes or perhaps more; I don't know." [...] On the 13th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States Air Force stated that they could not determine which of the two pilots shot down the first Japanese bomber: [...] "Each of them in his first attack shot down an enemy bomber, so the difference in time would have been but a few seconds in any case." [...] While in the air during the dogfight, the two pilots agreed that whoever survived the battle would claim credit to the title for the first kill. However, both pilots survived and because Welch outranked Taylor (he was a 41A, Taylor a 41C) and was the lead aircraft in the fight, he was credited with the first kill. The efforts of the two pilots’ dogfights {{were able to}} divert the Japanese from destroying the Haleiwa air field, which the Japanese intelligence did not know about prior to the attack. Taylor later reacted to the attack, saying [...] "I <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> was a better-trained pilot than the enemy. I had good equipment, and I was proud of it." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very deep green and I <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> was upside down {{and the sky was}} the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", have been described as [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail away my little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E

Louis and Thérèse both broke down and cried, but Louis got up, gently picked a little white flower, root intact, and gave it to her, explaining the care with which God brought it into being and preserved it until that day. Thérèse later wrote: [...] "while I listened I <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> was hearing my own story". To Therese, the flower seemed a symbol of herself, [...] "destined to live in another soil".
