The mostly linear {{molecules}} pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly <b>branched</b> <b>polymers.</b> HDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts or metallocene catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, {{the small amount of}} branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of free radicals at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules.

25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than <b>branched</b> <b>polymers.</b> Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single chain structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} microstructural {{feature of}} a polymer is its architecture and shape, which {{relates to the}} way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain {{with one or more}} substituent side chains or branches. Types of <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.|$|E

5000|$|... pH {{sensitive}} polymers {{have been}} created with linear block copolymer, star, branched, dendrimer, brush, and comb architectures. Polymers of different architectures will self-assemble into different structures. This self-assembly can occur {{due to the nature}} of the polymer and the solvent, or due to a change in pH. pH changes can also cause the larger structure to swell or deswell. For example, block copolymers often form micelles, as will star polymers and <b>branched</b> <b>polymers.</b> However, star and <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> can form rod or worm-shaped micelles rather than the typical spheres. Brush polymers are usually used for modifying surfaces since their structure doesn’t allow them to form a larger structure like a micelle.|$|E

In <b>branched</b> <b>polymers,</b> there are trifunctional units at each branch point.

5000|$|Star-shaped {{polymers}} are {{the simplest}} class of <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> {{with a general}} structure consisting of several (more than three) linear chains connected to a central core. The core, or the center, of the polymer can be an atom, molecule, or macromolecule; the chains, or [...] "arms", consist of variable-length organic chains. Star-shaped polymers in which the arms are all equivalent in length and structure are considered homogeneous, and ones with variable lengths and structures are considered heterogeneous.|$|E
5000|$|Transfer to polymer. Chain {{transfer}} {{may take}} place with an already existing polymer chain, especially under {{conditions in which}} much polymer is present. This often occurs {{at the end of}} a radical polymerization when almost all monomer has been consumed. <b>Branched</b> <b>polymers</b> are formed as monomer adds to the new radical site which is located along the polymer backbone. The properties of low-density polyethylene are critically determined by the amount of chain transfer to polymer that takes place.|$|E

In his publication, Benoit showed that all synthetic polymers elutes on the same curve when the log of the intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molar mass was plotted against the elution volume. This is the basis of universal calibration which requires a viscometer to measure the intrinsic viscosity of the polymers. Universal calibration was shown to work for <b>branched</b> <b>polymers,</b> copolymers as well as starburst polymers.|$|E

50|$|The β-hydride {{elimination}} {{can either}} be a vital step in a reaction or an unproductive side reaction. The Shell higher olefin process relies on β-hydride elimination to produce α-olefins which are used to produce detergents. Illustrative of a sometimes undesirable β-hydride elimination, β-hydride elimination in Ziegler-Natta polymerization results in polymers of decreased molecular weight. In the case of nickel- and palladium-catalyzed couplings of aryl halides with alkyl Grignard reagents, the β-hydride elimination can lower the yield. The production of <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> from ethylene relies on chain walking, a key step of which is β-hydride elimination.|$|E
50|$|Aggregation {{has also}} been combated by varying the {{chemical}} structure. For example, when conjugated polymers aggregate, which is natural in the solid state, their emission can be self-quenched, reducing luminescent quantum yields and reducing luminescent device performance. In opposition to this tendency, researchers have used tri-functional monomers to create highly branched polyfluorenes which do not aggregate due to the bulkiness of the substituents. This design strategy has achieved luminescent quantum yields of 42% in the solid state.This solution reduces the ease of processability of the material because <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> have increased chain entanglement and poor solubility.|$|E
5000|$|PARP-1 accomplishes {{many of its}} roles through {{regulating}} poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). PAR is a polymer that {{varies in}} length and can be either linear or branched.

PAR binding affinity is strongest for <b>branched</b> <b>polymers,</b> weaker for long linear polymers and weakest for short linear polymers. [...] PAR also binds selectively with differing strengths to the different histones.

The most important later innovation of C-3 introduced the non-explosive plasticizer butyl phthalate instead of this mixture of nitro compounds. This reduced the toxicity while increasing the concentration of RDX and improving safety of use and storage.
