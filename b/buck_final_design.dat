2500|$|One of <b>Buck's</b> <b>final</b> public {{appearances}} was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It {{was the first}} night that Major League Baseball resumed {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: [...] "I don't know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!" ...|$|R

40|$|Through the {{development}} of a space shuttle payload, there are usually several coupled loads analyses (CLA) performed: preliminary <b>design,</b> critical <b>design,</b> <b>final</b> <b>design</b> and verification loads analysis (VLA). A <b>final</b> <b>design</b> CLA is the last analysis conducted prior to model delivery to the shuttle program for the VLA. The finite element models used in the <b>final</b> <b>design</b> CLA and the VLA are test verified dynamic math models. Mission 6 A is the first of many flights of the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The MPLM was developed by Alenia Spazio S. p. A. (an Italian aerospace company) and houses the International Standard Payload Racks (ISPR) for transportation to the space station in the shuttle. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), the payload integrator of the MPLM for Mission 6 A, performed the <b>final</b> <b>design</b> CLA using the M 6. OZC shuttle data for liftoff and landing conditions using the proper shuttle cargo manifest. Alenia performed the preliminary and critical design CLAs for {{the development}} of the MPLM.

25|$|States usually {{employed}} one of {{two approaches}} in making this selection. In 33 states, the governor selected the <b>final</b> recommended <b>design,</b> often based on the recommendations of advisory groups and citizens. In the other 17 states, citizens selected the <b>final</b> <b>design</b> through online, telephone, mail or other public votes.

The media and public attention surrounding this process and the release of each state's quarter was intense and produced significant publicity for the program.|$|R
