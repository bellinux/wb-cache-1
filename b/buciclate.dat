50|$|Dimethandrolone <b>buciclate</b> (developmental {{code name}} CDB-4386A), or dimethandrolone bucyclate, {{also known as}} 7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-buciclate, is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a derivative of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) that {{was developed by the}} Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and has not been marketed at this time. It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17β <b>buciclate</b> (4-butylcyclohexane-1-carboxylate) ester of dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) - and acts as a prodrug of dimethandrolone in the body. Dimethandrolone <b>buciclate</b> is or was under investigation as a potential male contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Buciclic acid, or bucyclic acid, {{systematic}} name trans-4-butylcyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid, {{is a simple}} alkyl-substituted cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. The salts and esters of buciclic acid are known as buciclates (bucyclates). Pharmaceutical examples of esters of this acid include testosterone <b>buciclate,</b> a long-acting prodrug of the androgen testosterone, and dimethandrolone <b>buciclate,</b> a prodrug of dimethandrolone.|$|E
50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of testosterone <b>buciclate</b> {{in an aqueous}} suspension {{has been found to}} produce physiological levels of testosterone within the normal range in hypogonadal men for 3 to 4 months. The elimination half-life and mean residence time (average amount of time a single molecule of drug stays in the body) of testosterone <b>buciclate</b> were found to be 29.5 days and 60.0 days, respectively, whereas those of testosterone enanthate in castor oil were only 4.5 days and 8.5 days. Testosterone <b>buciclate</b> also lasts longer than testosterone undecanoate, which has elimination half-lives and mean residence times of 20.9 days and 34.9 days in tea seed oil and 33.9 days and 36.0 days in castor oil, respectively. In addition, there is a spike in testosterone levels with testosterone enanthate and testosterone undecanoate that is not seen with testosterone <b>buciclate,</b> with which levels stay highly uniform and decrease very gradually and progressively.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone <b>buciclate</b> {{is able to}} {{reversibly}} {{and completely}} suppress spermatogenesis in men when used at sufficiently high dosages. As such, the results of clinical studies for use of testosterone <b>buciclate</b> as a male contraceptive were promising, and trials continued as late as 1995, but progress ultimately came to a standstill because the WHO {{was unable to find}} an industry partner willing to continue the development of the drug. Because of this, the WHO backed away from testosterone <b>buciclate</b> and focused its research instead on testosterone undecanoate, which is also very long-lasting and has the advantage of having already been marketed and approved for medical use.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} C17β {{undecanoate}} ester of dimethandrolone, dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) (CDB-4521), {{a few other}} esters, such as dimethandrolone <b>buciclate</b> (CDB-4386A) and dimethandrolone dodecylcarbonate (CDB-4730), have also been developed.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone <b>buciclate</b> (developmental code names 20 Aet-1, CDB-1781), or {{testosterone}} bucyclate, {{also known}} as testosterone 17β-(trans-4-butylcyclohexyl)carboxylate, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that was developed in collaboration by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1970s and early 1980s for use in androgen replacement therapy for male hypogonadism and as a potential male contraceptive. It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17β <b>buciclate</b> (4-butylcyclohexane-1-carboxylate) ester of testosterone - and is a prodrug of testosterone with a very long duration of action when used as a depot via intramuscular injection.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas the {{terminal}} half-life of unesterified testosterone administered via intramuscular injection is very short at only around 10 minutes, {{the terminal}} half-lives of intramuscular testosterone esters are far longer. Administered {{in the form}} of oil solutions, the terminal half-lives are 0.8 days for testosterone propionate, 4.5 days for testosterone enanthate, 20.9 days (in tea seed oil) and 33.9 days (in caster oil) for testosterone undecanoate, and 29.5 days for testosterone <b>buciclate.</b> Although exact values are not available for intramuscular testosterone cypionate, its pharmacokinetics are said to be the same as those of testosterone enanthate, with [...] "extremely comparable" [...] patterns of testosterone release. Due to their varying and different terminal half-lives, the different intramuscular testosterone esters are administered with differing frequencies. Testosterone propionate is injected two to three times per week, testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate are injected once every two to four weeks, and testosterone undecanoate and testosterone <b>buciclate</b> are injected once every 10 to 14 weeks. Due to its relatively short duration, testosterone propionate is now relatively little used and testosterone undecanoate is the preferred testosterone ester for intramuscular use. Testosterone undecanoate and testosterone <b>buciclate</b> can be injected intramuscularly as little as four times per year.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone, as esters such as {{testosterone}} undecanoate or testosterone <b>buciclate,</b> {{has been studied}} and promoted as a male contraceptive analogous to estrogen-based contraceptives in women. Otherwise considered an adverse effect of testosterone, reduced spermatogenesis can be further suppressed {{with the addition of}} a progestin such as norethisterone enanthate or levonorgestrel butanoate, improving the contraceptive effect.|$|E
50|$|LNG-B {{has been}} under {{investigation}} as a long-lasting injectable contraceptive for women. A single intramuscular injection of an aqueous suspension of 5 or 10 mg LNG-B has a duration of 3 months, whereas an injection of 50 mg has a duration of 6 months. The drug was also previously tested successfully as a combined injectable contraceptive with estradiol hexahydrobenzoate, but this formulation was never marketed. LNG-B has been tested successfully in combination with testosterone <b>buciclate</b> as a long-lasting injectable contraceptive for men as well.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone is not active orally {{except in}} {{extremely}} high dosages due to poor absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism. In addition, steroidal androgens including testosterone are hepatotoxic {{and there is}} a potential for liver injury with high dosages of oral testosterone due to the production of supraphysiological local concentrations of drug in the liver. Instead of oral ingestion, testosterone is administered parenterally in the form of topical gels and creams, transdermal patches, buccal tablets, and subdermal implants. In addition, it is administered via depot intramuscular injection in the form of long-acting ester prodrugs such as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, as well as the particularly long-lasting testosterone undecanoate. Testosterone <b>buciclate</b> is an even longer-acting testosterone ester that has been developed, but has yet to be approved for medical use.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring of {{testosterone}} replacement therapy requires a reliable method for testosterone measurement. Determination of salivary testosterone, which reflects the hormone's biologically active plasma fraction, is a superior technique for this purpose. The {{aim of the}} present study was to establish a new sensitive time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay for the accurate measurement {{of testosterone}} levels in saliva and to validate it by monitoring testosterone replacement therapy in eight hypogonadal men. A clinical phase I- study with the new ester testosterone <b>buciclate</b> was performed to search for new testosterone preparations to produce constant serum levels in the therapy of male hypogonadism. After two control examinations eight male patients with primary hypogonadism were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (n = 2 x 4) and given single doses of either 200 mg (group I) or 600 mg (group II) testosterone <b>buciclate</b> intramuscularly. Saliva and blood samples were obtained 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days post injection and then weekly for three months. The time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay for salivary testosterone shows a detection limit of 16 pmol/l, an intra-assay CV of 8. 9 % (at a testosterone concentration of 302 pmol/l), an inter-assay CV of 8. 7 % (at a testosterone concentration of 305 pmol/l) and a good correlation with an established radioimmunsassay of r = 0. 89. The sample volume required by this method is only 180 mu l for extraction and duplicate determination. The assay procedure requires no more than three hours. In group I (200 mg) testosterone did not increase to normal levels either in saliva or in serum. However, in group II, androgen levels increased significantly and were maintained in the normal range for up to 12 weeks with maximal salivary testosterone levels of 303 +/- 18 pmol/l (mean+/-SE) and maximal testosterone levels of 13. 1 +/- 0. 9 nmol/l (mean+/-SE) in serum in study week 6 and 7. The time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay for salivary testosterone provides a useful tool for monitoring androgen status in men and women and is well suited for the follow-up of testosterone replacement therapy on an outpatient basis. The long-acting ester testosterone <b>buciclate</b> is a promising agent for substitution therapy of male hypogonadism and in combination with testosterone monitoring in saliva offers an interesting new perspective for male contraception. ...|$|E

40|$|Only a {{proportion}} of normal men participating in testosterone-based contraceptive trials develop azoospermia (responders). This study analyzed whether serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) are qualitatively different between responders and non-responders. Determination of in vitro bioactive FSH after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and analysis of molecular heterogeneity of serum FSH. LH and SHBG {{was carried out by}} chromatofocusing and concanavalin-A affinity chromatography in eight men who had participated in a previous contraceptive study with testosterone <b>buciclate.</b> Blood was withdrawn at 15 -min intervals on two basal occasions and 30, 45 and 60 min after iv administration of GnRH (100 µg). Pools of sera were separated by chromatofocusing in the pH range 3 – 6 and by lectin chromatography on concanavalin A. Immunoreactive FSH, LH and SHBG were assayed in the eluates. Bioactive FSH was analyzed by the rat Sertoli cell bioassay. Serum bioactive FSH increased after GnRH stimulation, without significant differences between responders and non-responders. The chromatofocusing profiles of serum FSH showed a significant shift towards the less acidic region after GnRH. The isoform distribution was similar in responders and non-responders. No significant differences were found in the relative proportion of FSH, LH and SHBG retained by concanavalin A. It is concluded that the extent of suppression of sperm production by androgen administration cannot be foreseen either {{on the basis of the}} response of bioactive FSH to GnRH administration or from the glycosylation pattern of serum FSH, LH and SHBG...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{tests can}} be used to screen samples for large groups of {{compounds}} having a particular effect, but {{it is often difficult to}} identify a specific compound when a positive effect is observed. The identification of an unknown compound is a challenge for analytical chemistry in environmental analysis, food analysis, as well as in clinical and forensic toxicology. In this study bioassay-guided fractionation, ultra high performance liquid chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) and accurate mass database searching was tested to detect and identify unknown androgens. Herbal mixtures and sport supplements were tested using an androgen bioassay and modifications in sample preparations were carried out in order to activate inactive pro-androgens, androgen esters and conjugated androgens to enable their detection in the bioassay. Two of the four herbal mixtures tested positive and bioassay-guided fractionation followed by UHPLC/TOFMS of positive fractions resulted in the identification of nortestosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone cyclohexanecarboxylate and methyltestosterone. Three of the four sport supplements reacted toxic in the bioassay or gave inconclusive results and were further investigated using UHPLC/TOFMS in combination with data processing software and an accurate mass database having approximately 40, 000 entries. This accurate mass database was derived from the PubChem database on the internet and coupled to the TOFMS software. This resulted in the tentative identification of several androgens, including methylboldenone, testosterone and the androgen esters methyltestosterone propionate or testosterone isobutyrate, testosterone <b>buciclate</b> and methylenetestosterone acetate. The study showed that bioassay-guided fractionation in combination with UHPLC/TOFMS analysis is a useful procedure to detect, isolate and identify unknown androgens in suspected samples. As an alternative, the use of data processing software in combination with an accurate mass database and coupled on-line with the TOFMS instrument software enabled the identification of androgens and androgen esters in the chromatogram even without bioassay-guided fractionation...|$|E
40|$|Suppression of serum LH and FSH, by {{testosterone}} (T) {{alone or}} {{in combination with other}} agents, has proved to be the most promising approach to male contraception. T enanthate, the only androgen preparation tested in male contraceptive efficacy trials so far, must be injected every week due to its short terminal elimination half-life of 4. 5 days and leads to supraphysiological T serum levels. A new T ester synthesized under WHO and NIH auspices, testosterone <b>buciclate</b> (TB), showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with a terminal half- life of 29. 5 days when tested in hypogonadal men. Here we describe the results of the first clinical trial with TB for male contraception. After two control examinations, normal healthy male volunteers were given a single im injection of 600 mg TB (group I; n = 4) and 1200 mg TB (group II; n = 8) on day 0. Follow-up examinations were performed every 2 weeks up to week 32. In both groups mean serum T levels remained in the normal physiological range throughout the study course. Serum levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) showed a dose- and time- dependent increase, with serum levels slightly above the normal range in group II for several weeks and a maximal concentration of 3. 8 +/- 0. 5 nmol/L (mean +/- SE) in week 6. No suppression of spermatogenesis to oligozoospermia was observed in group I. However, in group II, spermatogenesis was suppressed to azoospermia in three of eight volunteers in week 10 that persisted up to weeks 14, 20, and 22, respectively. In these three men, LH and FSH were suppressed by TB injections to the respective assay detection limits, whereas in the other five subjects, mean serum levels were only decreased to values near the lower normal limit for LH and FSH, respectively. In addition, throughout the study course, a significant difference in serum sex hormone-binding globulin was detected between the responders (mean values, 21. 2 - 26. 4 nmol/L) and nonresponders (mean values, 36. 2 - 46. 3 nmol/L). Serum levels of LH as well as total and free T at baseline and after TB injection were lower in the responders than in the nonresponders. Both subgroups showed similar increases in serum LH and FSH after GnRH stimulation. In a newly introduced GnRH antagonist suppression test, serum LH and T were decreased to significantly lower levels in the responders. These results indicate a different hormonal equilibrium and probably different susceptibility to feedback regulation of the responders compared to the nonresponder...|$|E
