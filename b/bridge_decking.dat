30|$|A {{number of}} factors related to bridge design can {{contribute}} to <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (ElSafty and Abdel Mohti 2013). Restraint is typically caused by end conditions and the composite action between the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the supporting members of the superstructure. The fixity conditions at abutments can influence cracking in the end spans of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> (Darwin et al. 2004). Restraint can also be provided by stay-in-place forms (Saadeghvaziri and Hadidi 2005). Thicker <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> tend to have less cracking (TRB 2006; ElSafty and Abdel-Mohti 2013), although the relative stiffnesses of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the girders {{is an important factor}} in the propensity for a deck to experience cracking (Hadidi and Saadeghvaziri 2005). The type of girder used in a bridge superstructure has been shown to influence cracking, with <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> of steel girder bridges often exhibiting more cracking than <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> supported by other types of girders due to stiffness (Perfetti et al. 1985; Krauss and Rogalla 1996). The type of phased construction and continuity between spans in bridges built with precast girders can have important consequences in <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (Sousa et al. 2012). ElSafty and Abdel-Mohti (2013) found that deflection is an important parameter affecting cracking. Reinforcing steel characteristics (including bar size, spacing, cover, and other details) can affect the extent of <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (Hadidi and Saadeghvaziri 2005) as well as crack widths and patterns (Soltani et al. 2013).|$|R

Two-step cluster analysis is a powerful knowledge discovery tool that can handle categorical and interval data simultaneously and is capable of reducing dimensions for large data sets. The analysis, of a total of 9, 809 concrete highway <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> in the Northeast climatic region, found that <b>bridges</b> with cast-in-place <b>decks</b> that have a bituminous wearing surface, a preformed fabric membrane, and epoxy-coated reinforcement protection are strongly associated with the high condition ratings for <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> regardless of the average daily truck traffic (ADTT).
