Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E

This paper reformulates his Argument in game-theoretic terms with asymmetric cost information, imposing the Requirement {{that both the}} foreign firm's threat and the home governments's promise of Protection should be credible. It derives a simple optimal tariff formula that depends Only on the expectation of foreign costs. It then shows that this tariff can lead to Welfare-decreasing entry, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>thee</b> foreign is relatively inefficient. However, If the formula is applied with dynamic consistency, and is rationally anticipated by both foreign and domestic firms, it prevents foreign entry-deterrence and improves deomestic welfare.

The two praised Amman's ability to [...] "elicit {{real-world}} reactions out of fantastical situations". However, Shearman and Pearson took issue with the way Doggett's backstory was extrapolated. They noted that Doggett had been portrayed, {{up to the point}} in the series, as a [...] "solid and reliable" [...] character. However, [...] "Invocation" [...] sees him [...] " [...] protocol and [...] like a bully" [...] because of a case reminiscent of that of his deceased son's, a situation that, the two reason, is too similar to Mulder's own search for the truth about his sister, Samantha. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris bluntly wrote, [...] "'Invocation' is a masterpiece, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> grade it on a 'Roadrunners' bell-curve."

6000|$|Now all England knows {{already that}} you do not fear those who can kill the body; but I {{sometimes}} fear that some of you are not enough afraid of that enemy worst of all, who can kill the soul too. And who is that? St. Paul tells us. He is [...] "the devil, who has the power of death," [...] who lies in ambuscade to destroy your body and soul in hell; and will and can do it; <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> let him. Now who is the devil? It is worth your while to know; for many a man may be, as you are, in the ranks of God's army, and yet doing the devil's work all the while. Many a man may fancy himself a good soldier, and forget that a soldier is a man, and something more; and that therefore, before you can be a good soldier, you must first be more or less of a good man. Do you think not? Look then, and see whether the most upright and god-fearing men in your ranks are not in the long run the best soldiers. I don't mean merely the best fighters--the bravest men in battle. There goes more than mere bull- dog pluck to the making of a soldier; and to make a good soldier, I hold that a man, though he be afraid of nothing else, must be horribly afraid of the devil, and that the better and braver soldier he is, the more afraid of the devil he will be.|$|E

50|$|Portfolio alpha is {{obtained}} {{by measuring the}} difference between the return of the portfolio and that of a benchmark portfolio. This measure appears to be the only reliable performance measure to evaluate active management. In fact, we have to distinguish between normal returns, provided by the fair reward for portfolio exposure to different risks, and obtained through passive management, from abnormal performance (or outperformance) due to the manager’s skill (or luck), whether through market timing, stock picking, or good fortune. The first component is related to allocation and style investment choices, which may not be under the sole control of the manager, and depends on the economic context, while the second component is an evaluation {{of the success of the}} manager’s decisions. Only the latter, measured by alpha, allows the evaluation of the manager’s true performance (<b>but</b> then, <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> assume that any outperformance is due to skill and not luck).|$|R

That it only clutches with its claws, and does not snatch or strike with them;--that it helps itself about with its beak, on branches, or bars of cage, in an absurd manner, as if partly imagining itself hung up in a larder, are by no means the most vital matters about the bird. Whereas, that its beak is always extremely short, and is bent down so roundly that the angriest parrot cannot peck, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> bite, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> give it a chance; that it can bite, pinch, or otherwise apply the mechanism of a pair of nut-crackers from the back of its head, with effect; that it has a little black tongue capable of much talk; above all, that it is mostly gay in plumage, often to vulgarity, and always to pertness;--all these characters should surely be represented to the apprehensive juvenile mind, in sum; and not merely the bird's climbing qualities.|$|R

6000|$|In formulating any {{summary of}} Carlyle the critic must {{remember}} that he is dealing with a man of two sides, one prejudiced, dogmatic, jealous of rivals, the other roughly sincere. On either side Carlyle {{is a man of}} contradictions. For an odious dead despot like Frederick, who happens to please him, he turns criticism into eulogy; and for a living poet like Wordsworth he tempers praise by spiteful criticism. [Footnote: Carlyle's praise of Wordsworth's [...] "fine, wholesome rusticity" [...] is often quoted, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> in part. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> read the whole passage (in Reminiscences) you will find the effect of Carlyle's praise wholly spoiled by a heartless dissection of a poet, with whom, as Carlyle confessed, he had very slight acquaintance.] He writes a score of letters to show that his grief is too deep for words. He is voluble on [...] "the infinite virtue of silence." [...] He proclaims to-day that he [...] "will write no word on any subject till he has studied it to the bottom," [...] and to-morrow will pronounce judgment on America or science or some other matter of which he knows nothing. In all this Carlyle sees no inconsistency; he is sincere in either role, of prophet or stump speaker, and even thinks that humor is one of his prime qualities.|$|R

Born of a need for communication and maturing through a hunger for information, these two human desires have made the internet indispensable. The overwhelming size of the internet makes it a formidable repository of knowledge. The figure below shows the Internet Software Consortium’s latest internet domain survey (www. isc. org), which estimates that there are> 160 mil-lion “hosts ” and that their greatest prolif-eration has occurred in the last four years. It is, of course, impossible to know how many people use the internet, but an educated guess is that ∼ 580 million people across the world (almost 10 % of the global population) were online in May 2002 (www. nua. com). Health is probably the largest single category of information hosted by the world wide web, and over two thirds of the online public—known as “cyberchondriacs”— seek information about it. 1 Despite its impact, the internet is still flawed. Access in the developing world remains limited, but initiatives like Digital Island seek to broaden the availability of material—such as JNNP—and make the world a smaller place. 2 While freedom to publish is part of the essence of the world wide web, cultural constraints will pre-clude consensus about what constitutes appropriate censorship. 3 The notorious excess of poor quality information— largely due to lack of regulation and com-mercial exploitation—has become enough of a priority for the BMJ to devote its 9 March 2002 (Evaluating the quality of health information on the internet) theme issue to it.
