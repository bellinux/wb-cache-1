5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} <b>by</b> <b>color</b> schemes. He chose blue-green and orange {{as the primary}} colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered the colors in post-production {{to make them more}} subtle, for realism.|$|E

The castle has one hundred rooms to enter through. If any characters enters a room, their group color will light up the room. Each of the princes starts with nine men-at-arms. Reinforcements will join the side of whoever last visit Gate Rooms. If no one entered a Gate Room before the man-at-arms appears, they will join the King's Guard.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs <b>by</b> <b>color</b> as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. <b>by</b> <b>color,</b> such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E

5|$|Release of The X-Files seasons on Blu-ray, {{restored}} in high-definition, {{was rumored to}} begin in late 2013. The German TV channel ProSieben Maxx began airing first-season episodes reformatted in widescreen and in high-definition on January 20, 2014. On April 23, 2015, Netflix began streaming episodes of The X-Files in high definition, marking {{the first time that}} the series has been made available in the high resolution format in North America. In October 2015, it was confirmed that the complete series would be reissued on Blu-ray, and the full set was released on December 8, 2015. The set was criticized for using the wrong fonts for the title sequence and season 8 was affected <b>by</b> <b>color</b> balance issues making the picture appear darker in most episodes. These issues let to Fox offering corrected discs and eventually issuing new sets with the correct color balance.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares <b>by</b> <b>color.</b> Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E

40|$|The Petersen {{coloring}} of 3 -regular graph G {{is equivalent}} to the normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> five <b>colors.</b> The normal coloring is a good coloring of edges such that every edge and its four neighbours have together three or five different colors. Jaeger conjectures that every bridgeless 3 -regular graph has a Petersen coloring. If the conjecture were true, it would imply other interesting statements about 3 -regular graphs. In this text we investigate normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> more than five colors. Jaeger theorem about nowhere-zero Z 2 3 -flow implies that every bridgeless graph has normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> seven <b>colors.</b> Independently on the Jaeger theorem, we prove the existence of normal <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> nine <b>colors</b> for graphs with a bridge, a cut of size two or with a triangle. The idea of our proof comes from Andersen's proof of existence of strong <b>coloring</b> <b>by</b> ten <b>colors</b> for 3 -regular graphs. Finally, we sketch the idea of the proof for other classes of 3 -regular graphs. ...|$|R
