5|$|In May 1921 {{the policy}} of the Canadian {{government}} towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal. Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern waters would replace the abandond <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> venture.|$|E
5|$|The USS Allegiance, an American nuclear submarine, is {{patrolling the}} <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> {{off the coast}} of Alaska when it comes across a craft below the ice that is {{emitting}} a radio signal. The Allegiance is ordered to fire upon the craft by Pacific Command. However, the craft manages to disable the sub using a high-pitched frequency, stranding it far below the ice.|$|E
5|$|The venture, {{financed by}} John Quiller Rowett, is {{sometimes}} referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea,</b> but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Humble Oil and Refining Company sent a {{specially}} fitted oil tanker, the , {{to test the}} feasibility of transporting oil via ice-breaking tankers to market. The Manhattan was fitted with an ice-breaking bow, powerful engines, and hardened propellers before successfully traveling the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea.</b> During the voyage, the ship suffered damage to several of its cargo holds, which flooded with seawater. Wind-blown ice forced the Manhattan to change its intended route from the M'Clure Strait to the smaller Prince of Wales Strait. It was escorted back through the Northwest Passage by a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker, the CCGS John A. Macdonald. Although the Manhattan transited the Northwest Passage again {{in the summer of}} 1970, the concept was considered too risky. A pipeline was thus the only viable system for transporting the oil to the nearest port free of pack-ice, almost 800 miles (1,300km) away at Valdez.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
40|$|Sea {{ice loss}} is {{proposed}} {{as a primary}} reason for the Arctic amplification, although the physical mechanism of the Arctic amplification and its connection with sea ice melting is still in debate. In the present study, monthly ERA-Interim reanalysis data are analyzed via cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis to understand the seasonal mechanism of sea ice loss in the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic amplification. While sea ice loss is widespread {{over much of the}} perimeter of the Arctic Ocean in summer, sea ice remains thin in winter only in the Barents–Kara seas. Excessive turbulent heat flux through the sea surface exposed to air due to sea ice reduction warms the atmospheric column. Warmer air increases the downward longwave radiation and subsequently surface air temperature, which facilitates sea surface remains to be free of ice. This positive feedback mechanism is not clearly observed in the Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and <b>Beaufort</b> <b>seas,</b> since sea ice refreezes in late fall (November) before excessive turbulent heat flux is available for warming the atmospheric column in winter. A detailed seasonal heat budget is presented in order to understand specific differences between the Barents–Kara seas and Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and <b>Beaufort</b> <b>seas...</b>|$|R

25|$|Between 1983 and 1990, BeauDril's mobile {{drilling}} units drilled a {{total of}} nineteen exploratory wells in the Canadian part of the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> {{with the support of}} Ikaluk and other icebreaking vessels: nine with the Mobile Arctic Caisson Molikpaq and ten with the Conical Drilling Unit Kulluk. Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expections for the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources. Molikpaq was mothballed after completing the last well in 1990.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic positioning systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea,</b> relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.|$|E
25|$|In 1982–1989, the Canmar drillships drilled only 10 wells for Dome Petroleum {{and other}} oil {{companies}} in the Canadian part of the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea.</b> In addition, four more wells were drilled by the drillships in the Alaskan waters in 1985–1991. Other wells were drilled from artificial drilling islands as well as novel drilling systems such as Kulluk and the single steel drilling caisson. While a number {{of oil and gas}} discoveries were made, none of the findings were sufficient to warrant commercial production. Following the falling oil prices in the 1980s and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, hydrocarbon exploration in the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> and the MacKenzie Delta gradually ended. Robert LeMeur was reportedly laid up in 1996.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beaufort</b> <b>Sea</b> {{exploration}} activity followed oil prices: it was kick-started by the Arab Oil Embargo in 1973 and withered as prices {{fell in the}} early 1980s. Canada's National Energy Program, which was announced just as prices peaked in 1980, imposed price controls on Canadian oil and further suppressed investment.|$|E
25|$|Other {{environmental}} concerns {{relate to the}} radioactive contamination of the Arctic Ocean from, for example, Russian radioactive waste dump sites in the Kara Sea and Cold War nuclear test sites such as Novaya Zemlya. In addition, Shell planned to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and <b>Beaufort</b> <b>seas</b> {{during the summer of}} 2012, which environmental groups filed a lawsuit about in an attempt to protect native communities, endangered wildlife, and the Arctic Ocean {{in the event of a}} major oil spill.|$|R

25|$|Robert LeMeur was {{designed}} to support seasonal exploratory drilling operations in the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>sea.</b> Her typical annual operational profile would begin in May with a warm-up that would gradually bring the vessel systems online after five months of cold lay-up. After commencing break-out, the Canmar icebreakers would first carry out one or more resupply missions to the drilling islands where exploratory activities have continued through the winter. In June, the icebreakers {{would return to the}} winter base to escort the drillships to predetermined drilling locations. Once the spread-mooring system had been deployed and drilling commenced, the icebreakers would remain on site to carry out ice management by breaking up large floes that could threaten the drilling operation.
