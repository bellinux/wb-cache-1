5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under a quarter of a mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a volcanic eruption under the Antarctica ice sheet 2,200 years ago. It {{is believed to}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E

5|$|Sinoceratops was {{assigned}} to the taxon Centrosaurinae, as a basal member by Xu et al. (2010) based on characteristics present in the skull. Sinoceratops bears several characteristics that resemble features in chasmosaurines, blurring the distinction between the Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae. According to Xu e.a. the basal position of Sinoceratops indicates that ceratopids originated in Asia. Sinoceratops however, shares a number of features with advanced centrosaurines such as Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus that are not seen in primitive centrosaurines like Diabloceratops, including a well-developed nose horn and reduced brow horns. The implication might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> genus represents a lineage that invaded Asia from North America through Beringia.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E

5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M. By the financial year ending March 1962 it reported a group net profit of £575,352 and a dividend of 22.5%. Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of total output. Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951. Information regarding Churchill-Milnes is lacking but a business called Henry Milnes manufactured lathes in the Bradford area {{for many years and}} it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the target of a take-over.|$|E

25|$|Julia Robinson and Yuri Matiyasevich {{showed that}} every Diophantine set has {{dimension}} no greater than 13. Later, Matiyasevich sharpened their methods {{to show that}} 9 unknowns suffice. Although it may well <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> result {{is not the best}} possible, there has been no further progress. So, in particular, there is no algorithm for testing Diophantine equations with 9 or fewer unknowns for solvability in natural numbers. For the case of rational integer solutions (as Hilbert had originally posed it), the 4 squares trick shows that there is no algorithm for equations with no more than 36 unknowns. But Zhi Wei Sun showed that the problem for integers is unsolvable even for equations with no more than 11 unknowns.|$|E
25|$|Needle tip knives: This type of knife {{money is}} {{distinguished}} by their long, pointed tip. They were unknown until 1932, when a hoard was unearthed at Chengde in Hebei province; later hoards {{have also been}} found in this area. It {{has been suggested that}} such knives were produced for the trade between the Chinese and the Xiongnu (Huns) who occupied this northern area at the time. It could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> type was merely a local variation of the Pointed Tip knives, or that it was the original type that became modified as it was inconvenient to use. Some fifty inscriptions have been recorded, which consist of numbers, cyclical characters, and other characters, many of which have not been deciphered.|$|E

25|$|Expression {{profiling}} experiments often involve {{measuring the}} relative amount of mRNA expressed {{in two or}} more experimental conditions. This is because altered levels of a specific sequence of mRNA suggest a changed need for the protein coded by the mRNA, perhaps indicating a homeostatic response or a pathological condition. For example, higher levels of mRNA coding for alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that the cells or tissues under study are responding to increased levels of ethanol in their environment. Similarly, if breast cancer cells express higher levels of mRNA associated with a particular transmembrane receptor than normal cells do, it might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> receptor {{plays a role in}} breast cancer. A drug that interferes with this receptor may prevent or treat breast cancer. In developing a drug, one may perform gene expression profiling experiments to help assess the drug's toxicity, perhaps by looking for changing levels in the expression of cytochrome P450 genes, which may be a biomarker of drug metabolism. Gene expression profiling may become an important diagnostic test.|$|E
25|$|In April of {{his seventh}} year, Amenhotep {{was faced with}} a major {{rebellion}} in Syria by the vassal states of Naharin and dispatched his army to the Levant to suppress it. This rebellion was likely instigated by Egypt's chief Near Eastern rival, Mitanni. His stele of victory carved after this campaign records no major battles, which has been read a number of ways. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> campaign was more similar to one of the tours of Syria which his father had fought, and he only engaged minor garrisons in battle and forced cities to swear allegiance to himoaths immediately broken after his departure. Alternatively, it appears that the two weeks when Amenhotep would have been closest to Mitanni are omitted from the stele, thus it is possible that his army was defeated on this campaign. Amenhotep's last campaign took place in his ninth year, however it apparently did not proceed farther north than the Sea of Galilee. According to the list of plunder from this campaign, Amenhotep took 101,128 slaves, which is an obviously exaggerated figure. Some of these slaves may have been recounted from the year 7 campaign, such as 15,070 citizens of Nukhash, since Amenhotep did not campaign anywhere near Nukhash on his year 9 campaign. However, even accounting for this recounting, the numbers still are too high to be realistic, and are probably just exaggerated.|$|E

[...] Booklist commented on how the [...] "unadorned prose provides an open window to perfect pacing and electrifying world building".

500|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} of close relations between Kent and the Franks. Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts, {{although not as}} equals: the Franks {{would have thought of}} Æthelberht as an under-king. There is no record that Æthelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on {{the true nature of the}} relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic, king of Orléans, and Theudebert, king of Metz. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes [...] "that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand". It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. It also has been suggested that Liudhard, Bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.|$|E
500|$|Although Chloe {{appeared}} {{alongside her}} television cohorts in the Smallville comic books, which featured tie-ins to the Chloe Chronicles webisodes, DC writers hoped to bring Chloe into DC continuity {{at least as}} early as 2007. The character ultimately made her first appearance in the mainstream [...] in 2010. According to writer Kurt Busiek, the problem of bringing Chloe into the mainstream comic book universe, and keeping her television background, was {{that she would have}} filled two roles: [...] "the Girl from Back Home and the Reporter". Those roles were already filled by the adult comic book versions of Lana Lang and Lois Lane, so the plan was to give the character a new background. Busiek hoped to make Chloe the younger sister of someone Clark had gone to school with, who was a now interning at the Daily Planet. Busiek believed that this would make her different from Lana and Lois, but still familiar to readers who also watched the show. Another distinguishing feature would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> version of Chloe would not know Clark's secret, nor would she be meteor infected. These ideas never came to fruition.|$|E
500|$|Plaza C was {{separated}} from Plazas A and B by a [...] wall and was the palace complex of the Ahpo Xahil, the junior co-ruler. Plaza C also had two temples facing {{each other across the}} plaza. The Xahil ballcourt was on the southwest side of Plaza C and the palace proper of the Ahpo Xahil was on the southeast side of the plaza. The Xahil Palace was built with an east-west alignment with the entry courtyard on the western side of the palace and had a central altar. The main palace was entered from {{the eastern side of the}} entry courtyard. The rooms and courtyards of the Xahil Palace contained a great deal of domestic artefacts. The Xahil Palace was destroyed by a major fire that resulted in the collapse of the adobe walls and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the complex where Pedro de Alvarado was lodged with his Spanish soldiers. It would also be the same building that Spanish deserters burned in 1526. The collapse of the building preserved the domestic contents of the palace for archaeologists, unlike the palace of the Ahpo Sotz'il where comparatively few artefacts were recovered.|$|E
