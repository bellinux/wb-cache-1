5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions to <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} {{featured}} many new characters such as Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned and Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis. Snowball I is mentioned {{for the first}} time and Waylon Smithers can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E

5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell could <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the engines.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> {{the sound of the}} group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1930s, the Glee Club {{regularly}} {{performed in}} NYC, including live radio broadcasts from several posh hotels including the Ritz-Carlton.

25|$|The {{top floor}} {{penthouse}} offers views of Greater Manchester, the Cheshire Plain, the Pennines, the Peak District and Snowdonia. The tower {{is known for}} emitting a loud unintentional hum or howl in windy weather, believed to emanate from the glass 'blade' atop the building. The hum has been recorded as a B below middle C and can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> {{large parts of the}} local area.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} played a {{significant}} role in the promotion of hyphy music in the San Francisco Bay Area by playing tunes from many of the local artists associated with hyphy. KMEL's mixshows have long contained exclusive hyphy music which can seldom <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the airwaves elsewhere in the country. Because the station broadcasts live via streaming audio from their website, it gives the genre a platform for possible worldwide exposure.|$|E
25|$|David, lyric tenor. The lyric tenor is a warm graceful {{voice with}} a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy and can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from {{approximately}} the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the D one octave above middle C (D5). The {{extent of his}} range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from C3 up to E5. A very quick, falsettoed E5 can be heard on their first album in the song Hoy Que Ya No Estas Aqui.|$|E

25|$|The Carmen Culpeper Chappell ’59 Centennial Campanile was {{completed}} in May 2007, and was heard {{for the first time}} ringing in the 2007 commencement procession. Ringing twice a day, the campanile can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> a mile away. Lee Hall opened after a two-year renovation, and now houses all key student services. During this renovation, a casual cafe - The Underground - was added to Lee Hall Basement, in the Fall of 2009. Beginning in May 2009 and largely completed in June 2011, Monroe Hall, the oldest building on campus, was also completely renovated. A 4-story parking deck {{was completed}} in the fall of 2006.|$|E
25|$|During halftime of the 1992 rivalry {{game at the}} University of Georgia, {{the band}} {{executed}} a prank that drew media attention and gained a level of notoriety. As the band took the field for its halftime performance, several band members carried a large tarp with the GT logo painted on it onto the field {{and used it to}} cover the logo painted at midfield commemorating UGA's football program's centennial. The band's performance could not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the boos that were elicited from the home crowd. Reportedly, the stands remained full during the Georgia Tech band's performance and cleared out when the Redcoat Band took the field, as spectators delayed making trips to the concession stands in order to boo the Tech band's actions.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and {{may not even be}} noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, {{it is not unusual for}} a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E

25|$|ELO's debut concert {{took place}} on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the {{recordings}} for the band's second LP and taking Hunt and McDowell with him, left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the electric instruments. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, {{who had been the}} driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello respectively.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{broadcasts}} {{since the}} 1970s {{and into the}} mid-2000s varied between WBBM (780) and WMAQ/WSCR (670), and often came into conflict with White Sox baseball {{by the start of}} April. On April 30, 2008, the team signed a three-year deal with WGN Radio (720 AM), with games airing alternately instead on WIND (560 AM) in scheduling conflict situations during the baseball season due to the Cubs having contractual preference to air on WGN; these moved to WGWG-LP (Channel 6/87.7 FM, an analog television station carrying an audio-only sports talk format using a quirk in the FM band) in mid-2014 when Tribune began a local marketing agreement with that station's owner. During the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, the Cubs agreed to allow the Blackhawks games to be broadcast on WGN and have the Cubs revert to WIND when there was a conflict. This allowed the Finals games to <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> a larger area due to WGN's clear-channel signal. All Blackhawk games are also streamed live on wgnradio.com, regardless of whether the games are on WGN or WGWG-LP. WLUP-FM (97.9 FM) is also utilized as an alternate station.|$|E
25|$|Adult sloth bears may {{travel in}} pairs, with the males being gentle with cubs. They may fight for food. They {{walk in a}} slow, shambling motion, with their feet being set down in a noisy, {{flapping}} motion. They are capable of galloping faster than running humans. Although they appear slow and clumsy, both young and adult sloth bears are excellent climbers. They climb to feed and to rest, though not to escape enemies, as they prefer to stand their ground. Sloth bear mothers carry cubs up to 9 months old on their backs instead of sending their cubs up trees as the primary defense against attacks by predators, such as tigers, leopards, and other bears. They are capable of climbing on smooth surfaces and hanging upside down like sloths. They are good swimmers, and primarily enter water to play. To mark their territories, sloth bears scrape trees with their forepaws, and rub against them with their flanks. Sloth bears have a great vocal range. Gary Brown, in his Great Bear Almanac, lists over 25 different sounds in 16 different contexts. Sounds such as barks, screams, grunts, roars, snarls, whickers, woofs, and yelps are made when angered, threatening, or when fighting. When hurt or afraid, they shriek, yowl, or whimper. When feeding, sloth bears make loud huffing and sucking noises, which can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> 100 m away. Sounds such as gurgling or humming are made by bears resting or sucking their paws. Sows emit crooning sounds to their cubs. The species is the most vociferous when mating, and make loud, melodious calls when doing so. Sloth bears do not hibernate. They make their day beds out of broken branches in trees, and rest in caves during the wet season. Sloth bears are the most nocturnal of bears, though sows become more active in daytime when with cubs.|$|E
