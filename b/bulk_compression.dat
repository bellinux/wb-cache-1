40|$|Giant vesicles {{composed}} of pure egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) or containing cholesterol (28 mol%) {{have been studied}} during a high hydrostatic pressure treatment to 285 MPa by microscopic observation. During pressure loading the vesicles remain spherical. A shape transition consisting of budding only occurs on the cholesterol-free vesicles during pressure release. The decrease in the volume delimited by the pure EYPC bilayer between 0. 1 and 285 MPa {{was found to be}} 16 % of its initial volume, whereas the <b>bulk</b> <b>compression</b> of water in this pressure range is only 10 %. So the compression at 285 MPa induced a water exit from the pure EYPC vesicle. The shape transition of the EYPC vesicle during pressure release is attributed to an increase in its area-to-volume ratio caused by the loss of its water content during compression. Because <b>bulk</b> <b>compression</b> of the cholesterol-containing vesicle is close to that of water, no water transfer would be induced across the bilayer and the vesicle remains spherical during the pressure release...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} typical {{mechanical}} properties for a catalyst support material, ZSM 5 (a spray-dried granular zeolite), have been measured {{in order to}} relate the bulk behaviour of the powder material to the single particle mechanical properties. Particle shape and size distribution of the powders, determined by laser diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confirmed the spherical shape of the spray-dried particles. The excellent flowability of the material was assessed by typical methods such as the Hausner ratio and the Carr index. This was confirmed by bulk measurements of the particle–particle internal friction parameter and flow function using a Schulze shear cell, which also illustrated the low compressibility of the material. Single particle compression was used to characterize single particle mechanical proper-ties such as reduced elastic modulus and strength from Hertz contact mechanics theory. Comparison with surface properties obtained from nanoindentation suggests heterogeneity, the surface being harder than the core. In order to evaluate the relationship between single particle mechanical properties and <b>bulk</b> <b>compression</b> behaviour, uniaxial confined compression was carried out.

Plastic flow was treated through explicit slip systems, with flow on each system taken to occur by thermally-activated random jumps biased by the resolved stress. Compared with simple Arrhenius rates, the biased random jumps caused significant differences in plastic strain rate as a function of temperature and pressure, and provided a seamless transition to the ultimate theoretical strength of the material.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During typical {{composites}} manufacturing processes, fibers are deformed in {{ways that}} alter their processing characteristics (e. g., permeability, stresses and resin pressure, etc.) and their resulting microstructure (fiber volume fraction, void fraction, etc.). In this paper, we review all available data for the deformation behavior of lubricated carbon fiber bundles and compared it to a recently developed 3 -D theory [15]. Most of the data, which is for transverse compression, exhibits very large scatter, but can be collapsed by shifting along the fiber volume fraction axis. It is hypothesized that the shifts represent different "states " for the fiber bundle, which can be represented in the model by a single variable, the available fiber volume fraction Va.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the relation between the}} <b>bulk</b> plastic <b>compression</b> behavior and the evolution of grain size distribution (GSD) due to grain crushing under high-pressure compression and shear, we performed three types of loading experiments; single grain crushing (SGC) test, one-dimensional compression (ODC) test and rotary shear (RS) tests. The materials used are an angular mountain silica sand and a round river silica sand. The major findings are summarized as follows: (1) The SGC tests reveal that the Weibull model is successfully applied with the modulus m= 2 for single grain crushing stress. (2) In the ODC tests, the relation between the applied pressure, p, and the resulting porosity, n, fits better on a bi-linear model in a log n - log p plot than in the classical e-log p plot, where e is the void ratio. (3) Both in the ODC and the RS tests, the GSD converges into a power-law (fractal) distribution with the exponent (fractal dimension) of about - 2. 5, which is close to the one for Apollonian sphere packing, - 2. 47 (Borkovec et al., 1994).

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) from {{a conventional}} cold press extrusion machine is {{not suitable for}} producing RDF from reclaimed landfill since it is not identical in shape and form after production due to the swelling of the plastic fraction contained inside the reclaimed landfill and hence needs a very high compression force. Moreover, a binder agent is {{needed in order to}} keep the RDF in a similar shape and form. A novel design and manufacturing technology for a hydraulic hot pressing machine has been established and can produce high-quality RDF without any binder. The two electrical heaters are installed at the inner core and on the surface of the mold. The compression force on the mold is performed by a hydraulic jack. In addition, a newly-designed locking plate system which is designed by a slider to open and close along the paired horizontal slots, can reduce the cycle time of the manufacturing process and yield higher productivity.

Surface pressure (π) –molecular area (A) and surface potential (ΔV) –A isotherms showed that the adsorbed GA at the air/water interface was desorbed into the <b>bulk</b> upon <b>compression</b> of the lipid monolayer. In situ morphological analysis by Brewster angle microscopy and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the raft domains became smaller as the concentrations of GA in the subphase (CGA) increased, suggesting that GA promotes the formation of fluid networks related to various cellular processes via lipid rafts. In addition, ex situ morphological analysis by atomic force microscopy revealed that GA interacts with lipid raft by lying down at the surface. Interestingly, the distinctive striped regions were formed at CGA= 5. 0 μM. This phenomenon was observed to be induced by the interaction of CHOL with adsorbed GA and {{is involved in the}} membrane-disrupting activity of saponin and its aglycon. A quantitative comparison of GA with GC (Sakamoto et al., 2013) revealed that GA interacts more strongly with the raft model than GC in the monolayer state.

If the hot ISM is at a given radius in hydrostatic equilibrium (HE), the X-ray data can be used to measure the total enclosed mass of the galaxy. Differences from optically derived mass distributions therefore yield information about departures from HE in the hot halos. The X-ray mass profiles in different angular sectors of NGC 4649 are generally smooth with no significant azimuthal asymmetries within 12 kpc. Extrapolation of these profiles beyond this scale yields results consistent with the optical estimate. However, in the central region (kpc) the X-ray data underpredict the enclosed mass, when compared with the optical mass profiles. Consistent with previous results, we estimate a nonthermal pressure component accounting for 30 % of the gas pressure, likely linked to nuclear activity. In NGC 5846 the X-ray mass profiles show significant azimuthal asymmetries, especially in the NE direction. Comparison with optical mass profiles in this direction suggests significant departures from HE, consistent with <b>bulk</b> gas <b>compression</b> and decompression due to sloshing on ~ 15 kpc scales; this effect disappears in the NW direction, where the emission is smooth and extended.
