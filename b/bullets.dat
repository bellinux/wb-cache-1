5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead <b>bullets</b> {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. <b>Bullets</b> lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but <b>bullets</b> lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for <b>bullets</b> since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. Concerns have been raised that lead <b>bullets</b> used for hunting can damage the environment.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>bullet</b> or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors {{in a single}} payment. The most common <b>bullet</b> structure is called the soft <b>bullet,</b> meaning that the final <b>bullet</b> payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of <b>bullet</b> structure is the hard <b>bullet,</b> which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard <b>bullet</b> structures are less common for two reasons: investors are comfortable with soft <b>bullet</b> structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard <b>bullet</b> securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|R

5|$|On 30 April, {{an autopsy}} {{was carried out}} on Mussolini at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Milan. One version of the {{subsequent}} report indicated {{that he had been}} shot with nine <b>bullets,</b> while another version specified seven <b>bullets.</b> Four <b>bullets</b> near the heart were given as the cause of death. The calibres of the <b>bullets</b> were not identified. Samples of Mussolini's brain were taken and sent to America for analysis. The intention was to prove the hypothesis that syphilis had caused insanity in him, but nothing resulted from the analysis; no evidence of syphilis was found on his body either. No autopsy was carried out on Petacci. In 2009, Mussolini's granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini demanded a police investigation into claims that samples of his blood and brain had been reportedly offered for sale on eBay.|$|E

This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E
50|$|In mid 1983, Fender ceased {{production}} of the <b>Bullet</b> and <b>Bullet</b> Deluxe models in the USA and began {{production of}} the new Squier <b>Bullet</b> models in Japan. At this time the remaining inventory of USA-made <b>Bullet</b> necks were mated to Telecaster bodies and distributed to select dealers as the Fender <b>Bullet</b> Telecaster guitar. Aside from the Fender <b>Bullet</b> decal on the headstock, this transitional model was nearly identical to the standard production Fender Telecaster. The Fender <b>Bullet</b> Telecaster was available only in late 1983, with production ending when the remaining stocks of USA-made <b>Bullet</b> necks were used up. This was the last <b>Bullet</b> model to feature the Fender name prominently on the headstock, {{as well as the}} last <b>Bullet</b> model {{to be made in the}} USA.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{critics have}} {{questioned}} {{the circumstances surrounding the}} <b>bullet's</b> discovery at Parkland Hospital. In a 1966 interview with author Josiah Thompson, {{one of the men who}} found the <b>bullet,</b> Parkland personnel director O.P. Wright, cast doubt on whether the <b>bullet</b> subsequently entered into evidence as CE 399 was the same <b>bullet</b> he held in his hand that day. Wright told Thompson that the <b>bullet</b> they found was point nosed, whereas CE 399 is round nosed. However, in 1964, both Wright and Darrel Tomlinson, a maintenance employee at Parkland who passed the <b>bullet</b> along to Wright, were shown the <b>bullet</b> and said the <b>bullet</b> in evidence appeared to be the same one as the <b>bullet</b> found on the stretcher, though neither could positively identify the <b>bullet</b> as the same one.http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh24/pdf/WH24_CE_2011.pdf ...|$|R
5|$|The 1966 NBA Expansion Draft was {{the second}} {{expansion}} draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held from April 30 to May 1, 1966, so that the newly founded Chicago Bulls could acquire players for the upcoming 1966–67 season. Chicago had been awarded the expansion team on January 16, 1966. The Bulls were the third NBA franchise to play in Chicago, following the Chicago Stags, which folded in 1950, and the Chicago Packers–Zephyrs, which moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore <b>Bullets</b> in 1963. In addition, the <b>Bullets</b> relocated to Washington in 1973 as the Capital <b>Bullets,</b> then became the Washington <b>Bullets</b> a year later, before becoming the Washington Wizards in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Wizards are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Washington, D.C. They are {{a member of}} the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team plays its home games at the Capital One Arena. The franchise was established in Chicago, Illinois as the Chicago Packers in 1961; after one season, its name was changed to the Chicago Zephyrs. In 1963, the franchise moved to Baltimore, Maryland and was renamed the Baltimore <b>Bullets.</b> It moved to Landover, Maryland in 1973 and changed its name to the Capital <b>Bullets.</b> After one season, the team became the Washington <b>Bullets.</b> In 1978, the <b>Bullets</b> won the 1978 NBA Finals in seven games for the franchise's only championship. In 1997, the team became the Washington Wizards, which is the team's current name. Since their formation, the Wizards have won sixdivisional championships, fourconference championships, oneleague championship and have appeared in the playoffs twenty-threetimes.|$|E
5|$|As with {{internment}} in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, {{resulting in}} a new surge of paramilitary activity. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic <b>bullets</b> in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared {{to a total of}} around 16,000 <b>bullets</b> and four deaths in the eight years following the hunger strikes.|$|E
50|$|A {{ballistic}} tip <b>bullet</b> is a hollow-point rifle <b>bullet</b> {{that has}} a plastic tip {{on the end of}} the <b>bullet</b> itself. This improves external ballistics by streamlining the <b>bullet,</b> allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves terminal ballistics by allowing the <b>bullet</b> to act as a JHP on impact.|$|R
50|$|The {{rest of the}} <b>bullet's</b> {{kinetic energy}} is spent in the {{deformation}} or shattering of the <b>bullet</b> (depending on <b>bullet</b> construction), damage to the target (depending on target construction), and heat dissipation. In other words, because the <b>bullet</b> strike on the target is an inelastic collision, {{only a minority of}} the <b>bullet</b> energy is used to actually impart momentum to the target. This is why a ballistic pendulum relies on conservation of <b>bullet</b> momentum and pendulum energy rather than conservation of <b>bullet</b> energy to determine <b>bullet</b> velocity; a <b>bullet</b> fired into a hanging block of wood or other material will spend much of its kinetic energy to create a hole in the wood and dissipate heat as friction as it slows to a stop.|$|R

5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or <b>bullets</b> left behind at a crime scene. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking <b>bullets</b> and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5000|$|When a hand gun <b>bullet</b> strikes body armor, it {{is caught}} in a [...] "web" [...] of {{extremely}} strong fibers. These fibers absorb and disperse the impact energy that is transmitted to the <b>bullet</b> proof vest from the <b>bullet</b> causing the <b>bullet</b> to deform, otherwise known as a [...] "mushroom". Additional energy is absorbed by each successive layer or material in <b>bullet</b> proof vests {{until such time as}} the <b>bullet</b> has been stopped.|$|R
5000|$|Ricochets {{occur when}} a <b>bullet</b> or <b>bullet</b> {{fragment}} is deflected by an object rather than penetrating and becoming embedded in that object.

5|$|Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The game's story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using {{a specially designed}} fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanic is the game's key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and <b>bullets</b> in the game are either black or white. <b>Bullets</b> which are {{the same color as}} the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white <b>bullets</b> fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black <b>bullets,</b> it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's <b>bullets</b> will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality <b>bullets</b> made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these <b>bullets.</b>|$|E
50|$|A soft-point <b>bullet</b> (SP), {{also known}} as a soft-nosed <b>bullet,</b> is a {{jacketed}} expanding <b>bullet</b> with a soft metal core enclosed by a stronger metal jacket left open at the forward tip. A soft-point <b>bullet</b> is intended to expand upon striking flesh to cause a wound diameter greater than the <b>bullet</b> diameter. Jacketed soft point is usually abbreviated JSP in the ammunition and reloading industry.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bullet</b> bow {{shockwave}} is {{the result}} of air being greatly compressed at the front-most tip of the <b>bullet</b> as it slices through the air. As the <b>bullet</b> moves forward a broadening wave of compressed air trails out diagonally from the <b>bullet</b> tip. The sides of the <b>bullet</b> create a conical waveform. This conical waveform may be audible to a witness as a whip-crack sound.|$|R
50|$|Danette {{approaches}} <b>Bullet</b> in an alley, {{asking if}} she knows where Kallie might be. <b>Bullet</b> takes {{her to the}} riverfront, a favorite spot of Kallie's. Danette reminisces about playing hide-and-seek with a younger Kallie, who would never hide. <b>Bullet</b> tells her Kallie will be okay. <b>Bullet</b> later finds Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone) alone in her hotel room, upset about Twitch. Lyric asks <b>Bullet</b> to keep her warm in bed, and they discuss Kallie. She tells <b>Bullet</b> that she notices her, and the two kiss.|$|R

5|$|The Syrians were {{equipped}} with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and {{those used by}} the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. The Syrians also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery batteries. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 <b>bullets</b> per rifle, 45 <b>bullets</b> per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other.|$|E
