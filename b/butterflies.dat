5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many <b>butterflies</b> are {{attacked}} by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few <b>butterflies</b> (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, <b>butterflies</b> are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|Collecting <b>butterflies</b> {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been {{replaced}} by photography, recording, and rearing <b>butterflies</b> for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British <b>Butterflies</b> in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>butterflies</b> {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Most <b>butterflies</b> have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the {{heterogametic}} sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female <b>butterflies</b> {{are less likely to}} lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius <b>butterflies</b> on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by <b>butterflies.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} Lepidoptera fossils {{are of a}} small moth, Archaeolepis mane, of Jurassic age, around 190 {{million years}} ago (mya). <b>Butterflies</b> evolved from moths, so while the <b>butterflies</b> are monophyletic (forming a single clade), the moths are not. The oldest <b>butterflies</b> are from the Palaeocene MoClay or Fur Formation of Denmark. The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds.|$|E
5|$|To {{create a}} death scene, Aronofsky drew from Mayan mythology the {{description}} of flowers and <b>butterflies</b> emerging from the bodies of valiant warriors when they die.

5|$|Adult <b>butterflies</b> consume only liquids, {{ingested}} {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of <b>butterflies</b> need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some <b>butterflies</b> also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{can appear}} {{coloured}} due to two mechanisms, pigments and structural colours. Animals may have both biological pigments and structural colours, for example, some <b>butterflies.</b>|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by <b>butterflies</b> is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. <b>Butterflies</b> are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Butterfly</b> Valley Botanical Area {{consists}} of <b>Butterfly</b> Valley {{and the surrounding}} area.

5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species {{for the purpose of}} mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly <b>butterflies)</b> wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E
5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> {{are widely}} used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, {{embedded}} in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings. The Norwegian naturalist Kjell Sandved compiled a photographic Butterfly Alphabet containing all 26 letters and the numerals 0 to 9 from the wings of <b>butterflies.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. <b>Butterflies</b> are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>butterfly</b> dares her husband, and the <b>butterfly</b> prevaricates {{by telling}} her the king called {{him over to}} ask him not to, because he is afraid of the <b>butterfly.</b> The wife insists he stamps, and {{he goes to the}} king, who tells him he will make it happen to help control his wife, sympathizing with the <b>butterfly's</b> plight. The <b>butterfly</b> stamps and the palace disappears.|$|R
5|$|In the spring, Tarwater won the US National Championship in the 200-meter <b>butterfly</b> {{with a time}} of 1:51.78, {{and placed}} fourth in the 100-meter <b>butterfly.</b> At Summer Nationals, Tarwater placed second in the 100-meter <b>butterfly</b> and was part of the National Championship winning 4×100-meter {{freestyle}} relay team. At the 2005 World Championships, he narrowly missed out on the medals, finishing fourth in the 200-meter <b>butterfly.</b> At the 2005 Duel in the Pool, Tarwater won the silver medal in both the 100-meter and 200-meter <b>butterfly</b> events. At the end of the season, he was ranked eighth in the world at the 200-meter <b>butterfly</b> and 20th at the 100-meter <b>butterfly.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Butterfly</b> wings also exhibit {{anisotropic}} self-cleaning, superhydrophobic properties. The <b>butterfly</b> wings exhibit anisotropy on a {{one dimensional}} level, {{compared to the}} other biological materials, which exhibited the anisotropy on a two dimensional level. <b>Butterfly</b> wings are composed of overlapping layers of scales, that have the best self-cleaning properties in the radial directions. This anisotropic interface my prove important for fluid controllable interfaces. Alumina layers patterned from the original <b>butterfly</b> wing have been used to mimic the structure and properties of the <b>butterfly</b> wings. Additionally, <b>butterfly</b> wing mimetic structures have used to fabricate anatase titania photoanodes. <b>Butterfly</b> wing structures have also been made using layer-by-layer sol-gel-based deposition and soft lithography molding.|$|R
5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> {{in their}} adult stage can live from {{a week to}} nearly a year {{depending}} on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a caterpillar. <b>Butterflies</b> may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory <b>butterflies</b> live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
