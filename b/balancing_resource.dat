Approximately 80. 1 % of proved balance of coal deposits resources in Poland occurs in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, where 50 fields are operated by 28 mines. Thus, since early 90 s of the 20 th century the USCB is attractive for foreign companies which perform evaluation of coal bed methane obtaining possibility as main fossil. However, all previous attempts to commercial production of CBM did not bring expected results, but they constitute extensive information database for current and future research towards CBM exploitation.

High-frequency implementations of the classic digitrecurrence algorithms for division have long latencies (of {{the order of the}} number fraction bits) and consume large amounts of logic.

Resource sharing is achieved by periodically redistributing the jobs among the queues.

We focus on useful approximations obtained by considering a heavy load {{and a large number}} of homogeneous queues. With these approximations, we show how performance depends on the assumed arrival pattern of jobs and the model parameters.
