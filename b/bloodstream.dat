5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the <b>bloodstream</b> (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the <b>bloodstream,</b> such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the <b>bloodstream,</b> as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the <b>bloodstream.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mice were {{infected}} intravenously with a sublethal dose of Listeria monocytogenes cells and then levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in the <b>bloodstreams,</b> spleens, and livers were monitored. The maximum level of TNF was detected at 72 h in the spleens and livers, but TNF was never {{detected in the}} <b>bloodstreams.</b> IL- 6 appeared in the <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens and peaked at 48 h. The maximum level of IFN-gamma could be detected in all three specimens, and the highest titer was shown in the spleens. Endogenous TNF production was suppressed by in vivo administration of anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) or anti-asialo GM 1 antibody but not by anti-CD 8 MAb, whereas none of these antibodies suppressed endogenous IL- 6 production. Endogenous production of neither IL- 6 nor IFN-gamma was inhibited in rabbit anti-recombinant mouse TNF-alpha antibody-treated mice. Similarly, production of TNF and IL- 6 did not decrease in anti-mouse IFN-gamma MAb-treated animals, but TNF production was augmented in these animals. These {{results suggest that the}} these endogenous cytokines are produced by different mechanisms in L. monocytogenes infection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Brain S 100 B {{assessment}} in maternal blood {{has been proposed}} as {{a useful tool for}} early perinatal brain damage detection. Among potential confounding factors the possibility of a protein gradient between maternal and fetal <b>bloodstreams</b> under patho-physiological conditions is consistent. The present study investigates in healthy and small gestational age fetuses (SGA) whether S 100 B concentrations differ among fetal and maternal <b>bloodstreams.</b> METHODS: We conducted a case-control-study in 160 pregnancies (SGA: n= 80; healthy: n= 80), in which standard monitoring parameters were recorded. S 100 B was assessed in arterial cord and in maternal blood samples at birth. Eighty non pregnant women (NP), matched for age at sampling, served as controls (1 SGA vs 1 healthy vs 1 NP). RESULTS: Fetal S 100 B in SGA and healthy groups was significantly higher (P 0. 05) were observed between groups. No differences (P> 0. 05) in fetal S 100 B have been found between the studied groups. Maternal S 100 B of SGA and healthy groups was significantly higher (P 0. 05) were observed between SGA and control groups. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that S 100 B is pregnancy-dependent with the presence of a protein's gradient between fetal and maternal <b>bloodstreams.</b> The present data suggesting that non-invasive fetal brain monitoring is becoming possible opening a new cue on further investigations on S 100 B fetal/maternal gradient changes under pathological conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} and roles of endogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in both lethal and nonlethal infections of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in mice. In {{the case of}} nonlethal infection, although no bacteria were detected in the <b>bloodstreams,</b> bacteria that colonized and proliferated persistently for 3 weeks {{were found in the}} kidneys. All mice given lethal injections died within 7 days, and large numbers of bacteria were detected in the <b>bloodstreams,</b> spleens, and kidneys. The first peaks of IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL- 6 were observed in the <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens of the mice with nonlethal and lethal infections within 24 h. Thereafter, in the nonlethal cases, IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL- 6 peaked again in the spleens and kidneys during the period of maximum growth of bacteria in the kidneys, although only IL- 6 was detected in the sera. In contrast, in the case of lethal infection, the titers of IFN-gamma and IL- 6 in the sera and TNF in the kidneys peaked before death. Effects of in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against IFN-gamma and TNF on the fates of S. aureus-infected mice were studied. In the nonlethal infections, anti-TNF alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) MAb-treated mice, but not anti-IFN-gamma MAb-treated mice, {{died as a result of}} worsening infection, suggesting that endogenous TNF plays a protective role in host resistance to S. aureus infection. In the mice that received lethal doses, injection of anti-TNF-alpha MAb accelerated death. However, although injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb inhibited host resistance of the infected mice early in infection, most of the animals survived the lethal infection by injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma plays a detrimental role in S. aureus infection. Thus, this study demonstrated that IFN-gamma and TNF play different roles in S. aureus infection...|$|R
