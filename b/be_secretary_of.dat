5|$|Congress created {{executive}} departments during Washington's {{first months}} in office in 1789, including the State Department on July 27, the Department of War in early August, and the Treasury Department on September 2. The President also received two additional officers without departments: the Attorney General and Postmaster General. Washington appointed Richmond lawyer Edmund Randolph as Attorney General and Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General. He also appointed fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State and Henry Knox as Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed Alexander Hamilton to head the Treasury Department. Washington's cabinet eventually developed into a consultation and advisory body, although this was not mandated by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1560 {{the diplomat}} Nicholas Throckmorton {{advocated}} vehemently against Dudley marrying the Queen, but Dudley won him over in 1562. Throckmorton henceforth became his political advisor and intimate. After Throckmorton's death in 1571 there quickly evolved a political {{alliance between the}} Earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham, soon to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State. Together they worked for a militant Protestant foreign policy. There also existed a family relationship between them after Walsingham's daughter had married Philip Sidney, Leicester's favourite nephew. Leicester, after some initial jealousy, also became {{a good friend of}} Sir Christopher Hatton, himself one of Elizabeth's favourites.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2013, Jewell was {{nominated}} by President Barack Obama to succeed Ken Salazar as United States Secretary of the Interior. Her nomination {{was approved by}} the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 21, with only three of the committee's 22 members opposed. On April 10, 2013, the Senate confirmed Jewell to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior in an 87â€“11 vote. She was sworn in as Secretary of the Interior on April 12, 2013. As Secretary of the Interior she oversaw the Interior Department, which has a budget of $11billion, employs 70,000 people, and acted as steward for twenty percent of the United States of America's land.|$|E

5|$|To {{show his}} {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the best-known}} advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, his Secretary of State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, the Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The {{committee}} was chaired by Stimson, with James F. Byrnes, a former US Senator soon to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State, as President Harry S. Truman's personal representative; Ralph A. Bard, the Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of New York Life Insurance Company. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the scientific panel offered its opinion {{not just on the}} likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states {{disagreed}} over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained {{in the possession of}} the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida's other Senator, David L. Yulee, and the two Senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern Senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree. In the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used his perceived pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a Republican majority for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Stimson {{himself was}} chairman. The other members were: James F. Byrnes, former US Senator and soon to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State, as President Truman's {{personal}} representative; Ralph A. Bard, Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development {{and president of}} the Carnegie Institution; Karl T. Compton, Chief of the Office of Field Service in the Office of Scientific Research and Development and president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology; James B. Conant, Chairman of the National Defense Research Committee and president of Harvard University; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson {{and president of the}} New York Life Insurance Company. Harrison chaired the committee when Stimson was absent, but Byrnes, as the President's personal representative, was probably its most influential member.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, President-elect Taft {{announced}} his intent to nominate Senator Philander C. Knox to <b>be</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State. Shortly after the announcement, the Clause {{emerged as a}} problem that caught those involved by surprise: Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not end until 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay. Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox {{would not have to}} forgo any emoluments. Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members. At the suggestion of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem. The Senate passed the bill unanimously, but there was much more opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives, where the same measure failed to get a required two-thirds vote under a motion to suspend the rules and pass, a procedure normally reserved for uncontroversial matters. After a different procedural rule was applied, it passed by a 173â€“115 majority vote and President Roosevelt subsequently signed the bill. On March 4, the first Saxbe fix became effective when the salary of the Secretary of State (but not that of other Cabinet members) was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000. The Senate confirmed all of Taft's Cabinet appointees on March 5, and Knox took office on March 6.|$|E
