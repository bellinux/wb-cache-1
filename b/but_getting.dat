5|$|The Season Eight DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim and the others {{trying to get the}} truck into the warehouse door <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> the truck stuck instead, Dwight trying to use Kevin as a bumper on the oil track, and Phyllis, Toby, and Ryan revealing what they would do if they won the lottery.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. <b>But</b> <b>getting</b> the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E

5|$|The American Red Cross {{called it}} a major disaster, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> relief into the area was stalled because of {{landslides}} blocking the ridge route running between Los Angeles and Kern counties. California State Route 99 was also blocked by a landslide ten miles south of Gorman, but the highway was quickly reopened later in the day. All aircraft {{not related to the}} relief effort were ordered not to land at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport. All 417 inmates from the Tehachapi Prison for Women were evacuated because of damage; the California Department of Corrections stated that the facility was left unusable. Most of the injured received medical care at Kern County General Hospital and some sought treatment at Tehachapi Valley Hospital, where some existing patients were moved to make room for new arrivals.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

Friedman states,"The best tool {{we have for}} curbing Iran's influence is not containment or engagement, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> {{the price of oil}} down in the long term with conservation and an alternative-energy strategy. Let's exploit Iran's oil addiction by ending ours".|$|E
25|$|The tobacco {{monopoly}} did not spur Novo Ecijanos to revolt, unlike the Ilocanos who staged an uprising over injustices in the system. Some tobacco growers in Nueva Ecija resorted to smuggling their own harvests {{in order to}} get some profit. <b>But</b> <b>getting</b> caught entailed harsher fines and penalties. Even sympathetic local officials {{had no choice but to}} enforce the unjust policies under pain of arrest and hard labor, once laxity on their part resulted in low production.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process itself has no unusual waste or byproducts, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> rid of old bank vaults {{can be a}} problem. Newer, modular bank vaults can be moved if a bank closes or relocates. They can also be enlarged if the bank's needs change. Older bank vaults are quite difficult to demolish. If an old bank building is to be renovated for another use, in most cases a specialty contractor has to be called in to demolish the vault. A vault's demolition requires massive wrecking equipment and may take months of work at a large expense. At least one company in the United States refurbishes old vault doors that are then resold.|$|E

25|$|Sagan {{started his}} {{season at the}} Tour de San Luis, taking his first podium place of the year on Stage 2 by {{finishing}} second. In February, after a three-week training camp in Spain's Sierra Nevada, he competed in the opening races of the Belgian classics season, finishing second in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and seventh in Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne. He then came in fourth at the Strade Bianche, {{being part of the}} four-man decisive move, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> dropped on the final climb to Siena. He took part in Tirreno–Adriatico, where he finished second in the overall classification, a single second behind Greg van Avermaet. This edition of the race was different in character from other recent editions since the only mountainous stage had been cancelled due to snow. Sagan also won the points classification jersey. Sagan claimed his eighth second-place finish without a win since the World Championship at the Belgian road cycling classic E3 Harelbeke, before taking his first win as a world champion in Gent-Wevelgem, becoming the first reigning world champion to win the race since Rik Van Looy in 1962. Upon his win at Gent-Wevelgem Sagan became the World No.1 in the newly formed rankings.|$|E
500|$|There {{was little}} {{immediate}} {{attention to this}} announcement of the theory; {{the president of the}} Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries. Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor Samuel Haughton of Dublin claimed that [...] "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old". Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his [...] "big book", suffering from ill health <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by John Murray.|$|E
500|$|Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was {{informed}} {{during the third}} season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended {{to spend time in}} Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of [...] "The Body" [...] was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.|$|E

Sometimes revenge can be fun. <b>But</b> <b>getting</b> to sing it again [...] came very naturally and it was hilarious to practice! The silly language and whimsy of The Sims games are a perfect fit for the song. I was laughing the entire time!" [...] Also, an animated music video was made for the Simlish version.|$|E
500|$|Shooting of Sanshiro Sugata {{began on}} {{location}} in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter. The censorship office considered the work to be objectionably [...] "British-American" [...] {{by the standards of}} wartime Japan, and it was only through the intervention of director Yasujirō Ozu, who championed the film, that Sanshiro Sugata was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. (Kurosawa had just turned 33.) The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.|$|E
500|$|Most of Hutcherson's {{childhood}} {{was spent on}} film sets {{rather than in a}} classroom. He attended New Haven Elementary School in Union until he began his career at the age of nine, after which he began homeschooling, with his mother as his teacher. He later returned to Kentucky to attend Ryle High School for one semester. Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon. He later said of his schooling experiences, [...] "I know it's something kids have to deal with every single day <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> {{up at the same time}} every day and having to listen to teachers talk about things I could learn so much more easily on my own, I hated it." ...|$|E

500|$|Parsons {{returned}} to Dahlgren [...] in March 1943. Around this time, a research laboratory was established at Los Alamos, New Mexico {{under the direction}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer as Project Y, which was part of the Manhattan Project, the top-secret effort to develop an atomic bomb. The creation of a practical weapon would necessarily require an expert in ordnance, and Oppenheimer tentatively pencilled in Tolman for the role, <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> him released from OSRD was another matter. Until then, Oppenheimer had to do the job himself. In May 1943, the Manhattan Project's director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, took up the matter with the Military Policy Committee, the high-level committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project. It consisted of Vannevar Bush as its chairman, [...] Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer who represented the Army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell as the Navy's representative.|$|E
500|$|The Wall Street Journals Gwen Orel {{wrote that}} [...] "maybe it’s the curse wearing off, but {{the use of}} {{parallel}} worlds and stories is better and better, sometimes even gesture to gesture. It’s about Snow and thwarted love this week, and that’s always compelling." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was more critical of the episode and gave it a C+. He felt that it was [...] "the strongest episode of the series since Rumpelstiltskin’s first" [...] flashback in [...] "Desperate Souls" [...] because it did a better job handling the fairytale storyline. However, Sava faulted it for containing predictable elements, having many of the characters acting stupidly, and for being [...] "painfully obvious while trying to be clever, aiming for poignancy <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> laughs instead." [...] Sava praised Griffiths' performance for [...] "min her wooden dialogue for some real emotional weight." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard called it a [...] "compelling story". He said that Spurr tells this [...] "naval saga", which had {{degenerated}} into a [...] "racial conflict", {{from the point of view}} of the people involved, [...] "people who had little time for moralizing or preachments, anything <b>but</b> <b>getting</b> on with the killing". American author and journalist Charles Kaiser, also writing in The New York Times, said that the book's strength is [...] "its ability to re-create the fear the Japanese engendered with their desperation tactics" [...] and the resulting American perception that they were all prepared to fight to the death. Kaiser added that younger readers may have a better understanding from this book of what led to US President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan, [...] "even if they ... question the morality of that decision".|$|E
