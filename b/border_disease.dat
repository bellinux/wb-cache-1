40|$|Bovine viral diarrhea- and <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> viruses {{of sheep}} {{belong to the}} highly diverse genus pestivirus of the Flaviviridae.

By contrast, <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> is not a target of eradication, although the <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus is known to be capable of also infecting cattle. In this work, we compared single dose experimental inoculation of calves with <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus with co-mingling of calves with sheep persistently infected with this virus.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether lambs persistently infected with <b>Border</b> <b>Disease</b> Vi-rus (BDV) can infect seronegative calves and cause transient viraemia and seroconversion, when kept in close contact. After a quarantine period of four weeks, two lambs persistently infected with <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus were introduced into a group of nine calves. The calves were negative for pestivirus-specific RNA and BDV and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) serum antibodies. All animals underwent a thorough clinical examination once daily throughout the study. Blood samples were taken for haematological analysis and detection of pestivirus-specific RNA and antibodies every one to two days for 73 days. In addition, nasal swabs were taken for the detection of pestivirus-specific RNA at the time of blood collection. Pestivirus-specific RNA could not be detected in blood samples or nasal swabs in the calves. However, seroconversion had occurred in six of the nine calves 72 days after introduction of the infected lambs. A serum neutralisation test clearly revealed that the antibodies were directed against BDV and not BVDV. It can therefore be concluded that the calves had become infected with BDV. However, the exact time point of infection could not be determined. The results indicate that after completion of the current BVDV-eradication program, sheep persistently infected with <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus may pose a risk for the cattle population...|$|E

Taking border quarantine expenditures as given, this paper develops a stochastic optimal control model (with a jumpdiffusion process) to determine the optimal level of surveillance activity against a disease incursion by minimizing the present value of the major direct and indirect costs of the disease, as well as the cost of the surveillance and disease management and eradication programs.
