Dave comes back to life to shoot Eric in the stomach, who collapses, once again to the same music. The sister herself (Kristen Wiig) enters the scene, and begins to read the letter (Dear Sister, <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> this..) until she too is shot in the gut several times by {{each of the three}} men on the ground, with the music cue restarting with every shot, until she collapses too.|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E

5000|$|Romeo Alaeff's {{art work}} has been {{described}} as [...] "blurring the boundaries between icon and art, funny and serious, traditional and experimental, public and private" [...] and [...] "explores the experience of inhabiting liminal zones, those architectural spaces, psychological and physical states in which contradictions collide." [...] Alaeff often approaches his work with a sardonic or dark sense of humor such as in his project The Evolution of Despair which consists of a series of detailed drawings of animals expressing human thoughts and emotions. His book, I'll be Dead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> This: The Existential Life of Animals [...] is a continuation of that body of work. A sticker campaign was also launched from the original Evolution of Despair drawings and is featured in the book and exhibition tour, Stuck-up Piece of Crap: Stickers: From Punk Rock to Contemporary Art.|$|E
