5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking {{at it with}} their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
5|$|Testing is the preview branch {{that will}} {{eventually}} become the next major release. The packages included in this branch have had some testing in unstable <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not be fit for release yet. It contains newer packages than stable but older than unstable. This branch is updated continually until it is frozen. Testings CDs and DVDs {{can be found on}} the Debian website.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E

5|$|Transient {{males and}} females move widely. Orangutans usually travel alone, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> travel in small groups in their subadult years. However, this {{behaviour}} ends at adulthood. The social structure of the orangutan can be best described as solitary but social. Interactions between adult females range from friendly to avoidance to antagonistic. Resident males may have overlapping ranges and interactions between them tend to be hostile.|$|E
5|$|About 20 large (40â€“150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side}} of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E

5000|$|Yet {{it may be}} {{said that}} these devils assume a body not in order that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> bestow life upon it, <b>but</b> that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> by the means of this body {{preserve}} human semen, and pass the semen on to another body.|$|R
5|$|Candidates {{may have}} {{previous}} college experience, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not transfer, meaning {{that regardless of}} previous college credit, they enter the academy as a fourth class cadet and undergo the entire four-year program. If a candidate is considered academically disqualified and not selected, {{he or she may}} receive an offer to attend to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School. Upon graduation from USMAPS, these candidates are appointed to the academy if they receive the recommendation of the USMAPS Commandant and meet medical admission requirements.|$|E
5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be important for many cold-water species.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E

50|$|In the judiciary, {{different}} {{judges have}} taken different attitudes. As a generalisation, for example, judges in the United Kingdom before the 1970s regarded tax avoidance with neutrality; <b>but</b> nowadays <b>they</b> <b>may</b> regard aggressive tax avoidance with increasing hostility.|$|R
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also be interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
5|$|Most bats are homeothermic, the {{exception}} being the Vespertilionidae, the Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae which extensively use heterothermy. Compared to other mammals, bats {{have a high}} thermal conductivity. Body heat is mainly lost through the wings as they are filled with blood vessels, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{be used as an}} insulator while resting. By wrapping their wings around themselves, they can trap a layer of still air around themselves. Smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bats, and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermy.|$|E

50|$|Rubber or fiber gaskets used in taps (or faucets, or valves) to {{stop the}} flow of water are {{sometimes}} referred to colloquially as washers; <b>but,</b> while <b>they</b> <b>may</b> look similar, washers and gaskets are usually designed for different functions and made differently.|$|R
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} E.sinuatum grow solitarily or in groups, {{and have been}} found forming fairy rings. Fruit bodies appear mainly in autumn, and also in summer in North America, while in Europe the season is {{reported}} as late summer and autumn. They are found in deciduous woodlands under oak, beech, and less commonly birch, often on clay or calcareous (chalky) soils, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> spread to in parks, fields and grassy areas nearby. Most members of the genus are saprotrophic, although this species has been recorded as forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with willow (Salix).|$|E
