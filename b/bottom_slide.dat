5000|$|The Tyer's no. 7 tablet {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a wooden case, on top {{of which is a}} metal slide, a switch plunger, a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: [...] "Line Closed"; [...] "Train Approaching" [...] and [...] "Train on Line". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the <b>bottom</b> <b>slide,</b> and replaced using the top slide. The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.|$|E

50|$|Because {{baseball}} {{shoes are}} spiked on the <b>bottom,</b> <b>sliding</b> with the spikes up increases {{the probability of}} injury to the defensive player covering the base. Knowledge of this fact can often increase the defensive player's fear of the possible contact from an impending slide and thus increase his distraction while attempting to make a play. Ty Cobb developed nine different ways to slide into a base.|$|R

30|$|For kinetic {{viability}} measurements under physiological conditions, bacteria were {{cultivated in}} an ibidi® glass bottom flow chamber (ibidi, 80168) within a temperature-controlled microscope incubator to guarantee constant nutrient supply and optimal growth conditions at 37 °C. Bioactive surfaces were prepared according to published protocols [23]. Briefly, glass cover slides, that later resemble the <b>bottom</b> <b>slide</b> {{of the flow}} chamber, were exposed to air plasma for 15  seconds (Harrick Plasma, PDC- 32 G) followed by dipping into a 5 % (v/v) aqueous DMOAC (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 1  second, and drying at 105 °C overnight. To test the effect of protein pre-incubation on the antimicrobial activity of the DMOAC coatings, slides were incubated in undiluted fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Scientific SH 30071.02) for 1  h prior to the assembly of the flow chamber. Bare glass cover slides were attached to the ibidi® chambers as control surfaces. The bacterial suspension (OD 600 0.05) in M 9 medium containing different concentrations of PI and SYTO® 9, was directly added to the flow chamber and immediately transferred to an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon TE 2000 -E) for in situ viability monitoring. Adhesion of bacteria to the glass <b>bottom</b> <b>slide</b> was allowed for 5  minutes before the flow chamber was gently washed with 5  ml M 9 medium (flow rate 0.01  ml/min) to remove non-adherent bacteria. As control staining at defined time points, the BacLight™ viability kit (Invitrogen, L 13152) was used according to the supplier instructions.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{enhanced}} Raman spectroscopy (SERS) {{has been}} largely exploited {{in the last decade}} for biochemical and biomedical research. But some issues still require attention before transferring SERS to bioclinical routinely practices, such as reproducibility, quantitative analysis and signal background interference. In this work we propose an easy and cheap route, based on a template stripping technique, for producing plasmonic nanostructured films with SERS capabilities. We focus our attention to nanoholes in a continuous gold film, conversely to the majority of the literature which is dealing with individual nanostructures. Plasmon resonances occur at the holes edges, thus enabling the possibility of SERS signals from biomolecules and the potential application as biosensors. One advantage of the nanoholes patterned film is the optical-subdiffraction pitch, which prevents any Raman and/or fluorescence signal arising from the <b>bottom</b> <b>slide.</b> This effect paves the way to standard glass slides, much cheaper than CaF 2 ones, as suitable substrates for SERS devices, without any interfering signal coming from the glass itself...|$|E
40|$|This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} preparation of polymer springs that twist under irradiation with light, {{in a manner that}} mimics how plant tendrils twist and turn under the effect of differential expansion in different sections of the plant. The artificial springs are typically 1 mm in width, 50 μm in thickness and up to 10 mm in length, their length being limited by cell dimensions only. They are made from polymer networks that keep memory of a liquid crystalline order, and in which an azobenzene derivative is introduced covalently as a molecular photo-switch. This liquid crystal polymer is prepared by irradiation of a twist cell filled with a mixture of shape-persistent liquid crystals, liquid crystal having reactive end groups, molecular photo-switches, some chiral dopant and a small amount of photo-initiator. This cell is assembled out of two glass slides separated by a spacer and covered by a thin film of polyimide that was rubbed along the long axis of the cell for the <b>bottom</b> <b>slide,</b> and along the short axis of the cell for the top slide. Once the cell is filled by capillarity, photo-polymerization takes place at 48 ºC and takes approximately 1. 5 h. The product is a photo-responsive liquid crystal polymer network that is characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and tensile strength measurements. The film is post-cured overnight at 60 ºC. Removing the resulting soft polymer film and cutting out the desired spring-like shape takes ~ 45 min. The springs operate at ambient temperature, by mimicking the orthogonal contraction mechanism that is at the origin of plant coiling. They are shape shifting under irradiation with ultraviolet light and can be pre-programmed to either wind or unwind, as encoded in their geometry. Once illumination is stopped, the springs return to their initial shape in ambient light conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to {{stability}} analysis of the Zheng-Gang landslide in the Gu-Shui hydropower station in China. Based on the geological field investigations, the formation processes, the deformation mechanism related to rainfalls and the instability mode are first analyzed. Large scale direct shear tests on soils in the slip zone are performed in order to characterize influences {{of the content of}} particle and water on natural shear strength. Due to the difficulty to consider the lateral constrain and curvature effects of the <b>bottom</b> <b>sliding</b> surface, different three-dimensional models are established using the limit equilibrium method and the large strain Lagrange finite difference method. The results of stability analysis are in good agreement with the field observations. It is shown that the natural landslide is in a limit state and the creep deformation along the slipping surface is the main mechanism of landslide instability under in situ conditions...|$|R

However, having a healthy body also need been the right health care. So, efficient and safe products are more popular with consumers.

The structural designs of its unique folding feature, adjustable bed, a fixed bracket, rotation driving handle, the <b>bottom</b> track <b>sliding,</b> etc., make up for the design of the traditional traction therapy instrument.

The legs were directly beneath the body like mammals, unlike the earlier therapsids with sprawling limbs.|$|R
