I have the very book from which he used to read now, for, curiously enough, in after years, when all these events had long been gathered to the past, I chanced to buy it among a parcel of other works at the weekly auction of odds and ends on the market square of Maritzburg.

40|$|Background: Currently {{there is}} limited {{evidence}} supporting podiatric treatment of children with JIA. This trial aimed to determine whether pre-formed cost-effective orthoses impacted on pain, quality of life (primary outcomes) and/or gait-parameters (secondary outcomes) in children affected by JIA. The RCT aims to strengthen and add new knowledge to the podiatric management of children affected by this paediatric condition. Methods: The study {{took place at the}} Gait Analysis laboratory at Queen Margaret University – Edinburgh and at the TORT Centre, Ninewells Hospital-Dundee. Children with JIA, as diagnosed by a consultant paediatric rheumatologist, were block randomised by a computer generator. Intervention was blinded to the patients. The trial group received Slimflex Plus insoles, with the addition of chair side corrections and the control insole supplied was made with <b>leather</b> <b>board</b> (1 mm thick) without corrections. Both insoles had the same black EVA top cover. Primary outcome measures were recorded at each of the 3 data recording appointments over the 6 months period, using validated questionnaires such as VAS, CHAQ and PedsQL. Tekscan™ equipment (F-Scan™ and HR Walkway®) measured in-shoe pressure and force data with and without orthotic intervention, using same type of sensors of equal resolution. Multiple foot strikes and repetitive gait patterns were compared pre and post-treatment. In addition, the HR Walkway® captures multiple sequential footsteps during barefoot walking; allowing barefoot and in-shoe measurements to be compared.
