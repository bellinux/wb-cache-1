5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A <b>baulk</b> of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a <b>baulk</b> of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Baulking</b> Green was a {{chestnut}} gelding British steeplechaser, sired by Coup de Myth out of Nicotine Nelly by Irish Trout. [...] He was foaled in 1952, {{and throughout}} his racing {{career in the}} 1960s he was owned by Jim Reade. He was usually ridden by George Small, and after the 1962 season was trained by Tim Forster. He raced in point-to-points and hunter 'chases; {{to be eligible for}} these races, he was qualified with the Old Berkshire Hunt. During his career, <b>Baulking</b> Green drew attention to the tiny village of <b>Baulking,</b> Oxfordshire (until 1974 part of Berkshire).|$|R

25|$|As {{well as his}} sketch {{designs for}} Britten's opera house, he also {{designed}} a memorial for Britten {{on the beach at}} Aldeburgh. It would have taken the form of a great timber <b>baulk</b> standing vertical on the beach. The idea was that holes drilled in the timber would play notes from Britten's opera Peter Grimes whenever a storm of sufficient power struck. The design was not realised and Cadbury-Brown was not keen on the actual memorial by Maggi Hambling.|$|E

25|$|Early {{railways}} (c.1840s) {{experimented with}} continuous bearing railtrack, {{in which the}} rail was supported along its length, with examples including Brunel's <b>baulk</b> road on the Great Western Railway, as well as use on the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to a design by John Hawkshaw, and elsewhere. Continuous-bearing designs were also promoted by other engineers. The system was trialled on the Baltimore and Ohio railway in the 1840s, but {{was found to be}} more expensive to maintain than rail with cross sleepers.|$|E
25|$|His record {{break of}} 4,137 {{was made in}} a match he lost against Joe Davis at Thurston Hall on 19 January 1932. However, this precipitated {{a change in the}} rules of the game. As this break mostly {{consisted}} of long runs of close cannons (a total of 902 cannons were scored), the Billiards Control Council established the first version of the baulk-line-rule, in which the cue ball had to cross the <b>baulk</b> line every 200 points during a break. A 1932 tour of the United States and Canada by several players, including Lindrum, proved a disaster, with disappointing attendances and financial losses by the players.|$|E
25|$|In the Grand Prix final in 2005, Higgins beat Ronnie O'Sullivan 9–2. In doing so, {{he became}} the first player to record four {{consecutive}} centuries in a ranking tournament, with breaks of 103, 104, 138 and 128 in frames 7 to 10. Higgins scored 494 points without reply, which was then a record (Ding Junhui managed 495 points against Stephen Hendry in the Premier League in 2007). Higgins and O'Sullivan also contested the Masters finals in 2005 and 2006. Higgins was beaten 3–10 in 2005. In 2006, he lost the first three frames, but won the next five to establish a lead after the first session. O'Sullivan levelled in the evening, and the match went to a deciding frame. On a 60 break, O'Sullivan missed a red to a <b>baulk</b> pocket, and Higgins made a clearance of 64 to win 10–9 to claim the title for the second time.|$|E
50|$|Bolsters are <b>baulks</b> {{of timber}} fixed across the bed. The bed is thus not flat, but most loads such as girders, rails, timber lengths, signal posts etc are stiff {{enough that they}} only need to be {{supported}} at intervals, not continuously across a flat planked bed. The space between <b>baulks</b> allows room for tie-down chains or lifting strops, making this bolster design easier to work with than a completely flat bed.|$|R

25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} {{forget to}} touch in or touch out, {{are unable to}} find the yellow readers {{or it may be}} too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, <b>baulk</b> at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
500|$|For the {{permanent}} way Brunel {{decided to use}} a light bridge rail continuously supported on thick timber baulks, known as [...] "baulk road". Thinner timber transoms were used to keep the baulks the correct distance apart. This produced a smoother track and the whole assembly proved cheaper than using conventional sleepers for broad-gauge track, although this advantage was lost with standard- or mixed-gauge lines because of the higher ratio of timber to length of line. More conventional track forms were later used, although <b>baulk</b> road could still be seen in sidings {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 March 1849, despite the {{presence}} of police from Bury and Pendleton, the L placed a large <b>baulk</b> of timber across the ELR's line at Clifton Junction, effectively blocking it. [...] Employees from both companies arrived at the scene, and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold. [...] The L also pulled a train past the junction, blocking the up line to the city. [...] Its engine was pointed south-east toward Manchester, available to any ELR passengers who wished to continue their journey. [...] An ELR train arrived from Bury, and stopped. [...] L employees attempted to take tickets from the ELR's passengers, but were refused, as the ELR had already taken tickets at their Ringley Road station. [...] ELR employees then removed the <b>baulk</b> of timber, and in an effort to push the L train out of the way, drove their train forward. [...] The L had anticipated this, and moved another engine (taken from a L train from Manchester) to the front of their Manchester-bound train. [...] The ELR then blocked the L down line with another of their trains, laden with stone, moving it to a position directly abreast of the L train. [...] The line remained completely blocked until about mid-day, with a queue of trains from both companies, and from the Blackburn and Darwen Railway, building up {{on each side of the}} blockage. [...] The situation was eventually defused when the L withdrew their train.|$|E

500|$|Hacking's {{account of}} the events of 12 March is similar to that {{reported}} by The Times. [...] He claims to have travelled to Clifton to witness an L clerk being prevented from collecting tickets, and to have then continued on another train to Manchester. [...] On his arrival there, he saw L employees ready to pull up the rails to the ELR platform, although the rails were left intact. [...] He then mentions returning to Clifton after hearing that L employees had recently left for the station. [...] He blamed the Managing Director of the L, Captain Law, and Mr Blackmore, superintendent of the Bolton line, for ordering theline to be blocked with the <b>baulk</b> of timber. [...] Hacking also mentions an approaching up-train from Bolton, which on encountering the blockage apparently moved across to the down line to bypass it– in the face of oncoming traffic. [...] Expressing his shock, he claims to have ordered the ELR's stone train onto the down line, changing the signals accordingly. [...] Hacking's account ends by claiming that Blackmore ordered the L train to move, effectively resolving the dispute.|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the Whitlam government, the Opposition, led by Billy Snedden (who {{replaced}} McMahon as Liberal leader in December 1972) sought to use control of the Senate to <b>baulk</b> Whitlam. It did not seek to block all government legislation; the Coalition senators, led by Senate Liberal leader Reg Withers, sought to block government legislation only when the obstruction would advance the Opposition's agenda. The Whitlam government also had troubles in relations with the states. New South Wales refused the government's request that it close the Rhodesian Information Centre in Sydney. The Queensland premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen refused to consider any adjustment in Queensland's border with Papua New Guinea, which, due to the state's ownership of islands in the Torres Strait, came within half a kilometre (about one-third of a mile) of the Papuan mainland. Liberal state governments in New South Wales and Victoria were re-elected by large margins in 1973. Whitlam and his majority in the House of Representatives proposed a constitutional referendum in December 1973, transferring control of wages and prices from the states to the federal government. [...] The two propositions failed to attract a majority of voters in any state, and were rejected by over 800,000votes nationwide.|$|E
