50|$|Ice calving, {{also known}} as glacier calving or iceberg calving, is the {{breaking}} of ice chunks {{from the edge of}} a glacier. It is a form of ice ablation or ice disruption and is normally caused by the glacier expanding. It is the sudden release and breaking away of a mass of ice from a glacier, iceberg, ice front, ice shelf, or crevasse. The ice that breaks away can be classified as an iceberg, but may also be a growler, <b>bergy</b> <b>bit,</b> or a crevasse wall breakaway.|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{oil and gas}} {{operations}} {{conducted in}} harsh environments such offshore Newfoundland may pose additional risks due to collision of smaller ice pieces and bergy bits with the offshore structures, including their topsides {{in the case of}} gravity based structures particularly in extreme waves. In this paper, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) prediction for wave loads acting on a <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> around a fixed offshore platform is presented. Often the vertical column of a gravity based structure is designed against ice collisions, if operating in such an environment. In practices, topsides are usually protected by being placed sufficiently high from the still water level, away from the reach of the bergy bits. This vertical clearance between the still water level and the topside deck is known an air gap. Hence, the amount of the air gap planned for such an offshore structure is an important factor {{for the safety of the}} topsides at a given location. In this study a CFD method is applied to estimate the dynamic response of the <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> and provide a reliable air gap to reduce the potential risk of the <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> collision. In advance of more complex collision simulations using a free-floating ice for the airgap design, CFD analysis of wave load prediction on a stationary <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> is carried out and reported in this paper. In the experiments and CFD simulations, the location of the <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> is changed to quantify the change of wave load due to the hydrodynamic interaction between the <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> and the platform. Finally, the results of the CFD simulations are compared with the relevant experiment results to confirm the simulation performance prior to the free floating <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> simulations.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of a collision between the CCGS Terry Fox icebreaker and a <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> (1911 t glacial ice mass) {{have been conducted}} using LS-DynaTM software, which incorporates a full Navier-Stokes solver for the fluid component. First results compared favorably with actual data acquired during field tests in June, 2001. The simulations were run on a Beowulf cluster consisting of 15 high-performance CPU?s. The modeled volume, including the vessel, water and <b>bergy</b> <b>bit,</b> was meshed using AnsysTM software and contained approximately one million elements. A prior set of non-impact {{simulations of}} a model tanker transiting in proximity to model bergy bits showed that at least this number of elements was required. In the results presented here the vessel was traveling at 5 m/s and the impact occurred {{on the port side}} of the hull, in the region where the instruments were located during the field tests. A hard crushable foam material model was used for the <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> in order to model previously observed ice behavior where the ice contact interface consists of a relatively intact hard zone of ice surrounded by softer pulverized ice. The simulation produced reasonable values for the load, pressure and impact duration values obtained in the field. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Icebergs and <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> {{makes up}} a {{significant}} {{component of the}} total freshwater flux from the Greenland Ice Sheet to the ocean.

In an attempt to fill this critical knowledge gap, we developed the open-source EXpendable Ice TrackEr (EXITE). EXITE is a low-cost, satellite-tracked GPS beacon capable of high-resolution temporal measurements over extended deployment periods (30 days or more). Furthermore, EXITE can transform to a surface drifter when its host iceberg capsizes or fragments. Here we describe basic construction of an EXITE beacon and present results from a deployment in Godthåbsfjord (SW Greenland) in August 2016. Overall, EXITE trajectories show out-fjord surface transport, in agreement with a simple estuarine circulation paradigm.

40|$|A new impact {{panel has}} been used to measure forces and {{pressures}} during collisions of a ship (CCGS Terry Fox) with <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> and a small iceberg. Data were acquired from impacts on <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> of various sizes (100 - 22, 000 tonnes) and over a range of ship speeds (5 - 12 kt). The data indicate that a typical zone of ice contact during a collision is comprised of a small irregular shaped area of relatively intact ice, where the pressure is high (8 - 20 MPa) and roughly uniform, that is usually surrounded by a larger area of pulverized ice, where the pressure is low (~ 2. 5 MPa). The maximum estimated force measured was around 2. 4 MN. The relatively low force values were attributed to the slanted shape of the impacted hull resulting in a glancing/sliding type of impact with limited ice penetration. Duration of impacts was in the 0. 2 ? 0. 6 s range. Pressure on the hard zones was observed to increase as the hard zone area increased. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of a collision between a loaded tanker and a <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> {{have been conducted}} using LSDyna 2 ̆ 122 software. The simulations incorporated hydrodynamics, via LS-Dyna's ALE formulation, and a validated crushable foam ice model. The major portion of the vessel {{was treated as a}} rigid body and a section of the hull, located on the starboard side of the forward bow where the ice contact occurred, was modeled as typical ship grillage that could deform and sustain damage {{as a result of the}} collision. Strategies for dealing with the highly varying mesh densities needed for the simulations are discussed as well as load and pressure distribution on the grillage throughout the course of the collision. Realistic movement of the <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> due to the vessel's bow wave prior to contact with the ice was observed and the damage to the grillage resembled published results from actual grillage damage tests in the lab. A load measurement from the lab tests compared reasonably well with a rough estimate from the simulation.

40|$|The Canadian Ice Service, Environment Canada, is {{currently}} developing an operational iceberg forecasting model; the present work forms {{part of that}} effort. While existing models predict iceberg drift and deterioration, the new model will account for calving that produces smaller ice pieces and subsequently track the drift and melt of the calved pieces. <b>Bergy</b> <b>bits</b> and growlers, which we consider here to be ice pieces in the size range from 3 to 20 m, can cause large forces upon impact with offshore structures. The probability of encountering these <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> and growlers is of significant interest to marine transportation and offshore resource development. Calving due to wave-induced erosion at the waterline of a floating iceberg can produce many thousands of small ice pieces having a wide distribution of sizes. These small ice pieces then melt as individual entities and eventually disappear. Since the calving events occur periodically, there is a continual supply of small ice pieces {{in the neighborhood of}} the parent iceberg. The focus of the present paper is on the evolution of the size-frequency distribution function for the calved ice pieces. It makes use of the initial distribution function following the calving event discussed by Savage et al. (2000). Dimensional analysis, laboratory tests, and field observations are applied to obtain simple correlations and devise a melt law for the smaller ice pieces. This melt law is then used to determine the temporal evolution of the small ice piece size-frequency distribution function. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{trajectory of}} a small lifeboat in a surgace wave is computed via the methods Lagrangian dynamics. It is assumed that the motion normal to the wave surface is small and can be neglected, i. e. the boat moves along the propagating wave profile. Wave diffraction and reflection are aslo assumed to be negligible. A Stokes' second order wave is used and the wave forces are applied using Morison's equation for a body in accelerated flow. Wind loads are similarly modeled using drag coefficients. The equations are solved numerically for various initial confitions in a typical severe sea state.

40|$|Shuttle tankers and {{hydrocarbon}} production platforms {{operating on the}} Grand Banks of Newfoundland must be designed for some level of ice loading. In some cases, high ice loads can result from relatively small icebergs, bergy bits, or growlers. This is particularly true when wave-induced ice motions are significant (in high sea states) or when vessel speeds are high (e. g., a transiting tanker). Safe and economic operations {{can be achieved by}} designing structures that are strong enough to withstand ice loads, planning for and managing ice {{to reduce the risk of}} collisions, or a combination of the two. In all cases, accurate information on the number of small ice masses is important. Unfortunately, reliable information on small ice mass populations is not available. The extensive, detailed aerial surveys that would be required to build up meaningful statistics on <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> populations would be prohibitively expensive, and other methods of estimating <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> populations are required for the development of a reliable database. The approach used in this study was a reanalysis of International Ice Patrol (IIP) operational iceberg observations. Although the IIP does not detect and report all bergy bits and growlers, their database contains critical information on the location of small ice masses in relation to the aircraft track, and the prevailing visibility and sea-state conditions. By resampling only those ice masses observed when detection conditions were favourable, and within a prescribed distance from the aircraft, more accurate <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> statistics have been determined. A convenient measure of the number of bergy bits and growlers is the ?small ice mass to parent iceberg? (SIMPI) ratio. This relates the number of small glacial ice masses to the number of parent icebergs from which most small ice masses are calved. The average SIMPI ratio for the study region was 0. 59. Some interesting phenomena revealed in the study include the apparent geographical variation in the small ice mass to parent iceberg ratio, with increasing values to the north and west. The ratio also varied seasonally. Of the months in which sufficiently large numbers of icebergs were observed to produce meaningful statistics, the SIMPI ratio was lowest in March (0. 25) and highest in May (0. 81).

40|$|A {{new design}} has been {{generated}} for an impact panel that {{is intended for}} use in a second <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> / ship collision field study. The design incorporates new technology to measure impact loads and pressure distribution at fine spatial resolution. The panel consists of 6 large sensing modules. Each module is a solid acrylic block with dimensions 1 m x 1 m x 0. 46 m, giving the impact panel a total sensing area of 6 m 2. Each module sits on four flat-jack type load cells. All 6 modules are housed in a 3 m x 2 m rigid steel structure that is welded to the hull of the vessel at the bow center. The top surface of each module is covered with a new pressure-sensing mechano-optical technology capable of measuring pressure with an effective unit sensing area of about 1. 3 cm x 1. 3 cm. Data from the sensing modules are recorded by cameras operating at a capture rate of 250 images/s that are situated at the back end of each sensing module. A secondary means of measuring pressure at an array of locations on each module surface consists of strain gauges imbedded in the acrylic close to the impacting surface.

Percent differences between the two measurement systems ranged from 6. 3 to 12. 1 % for the sway and pitch forces, depending upon whether the impact was symmetrical or oblique. The surge force from MOTAN was about 20 % less than the longitudinal force measured on the impact plate.

40|$|The CCGS Terry Fox {{field trials}} {{produced}} impacts with growlers, <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> {{and a small}} iceberg over a range of velocities. Ice mass ranged from 30 t to 22, 000 t and velocity from 0. 1 m/s to 6. 6 m/s. Results have been analysed looking at the effect of speed and ice mass on the measured impact force. There was considerable scatter in the results until {{the rate of the}} rise time of the measured impact force was taken into consideration. A trend of increasing impact force with loading rate was observed. To further examine this aspect of rate effect on impact forces, medium scale field indentation tests were also studied, since they were done to simulate full scale impact loading. The tests were done at a number of locations in the Arctic on iceberg ice and multi-year ice, and also showed a rate effect. For the CCGS Terry Fox the maximum force related to the loading rate with the following expression where F is force in MN and is loading rate in MN/s. The expression is supported by data up to a maximum force of 6 MN. Higher forces at comparable loading rates were achieved in the field indentation tests due to higher loading system capacity and better ice-indentor contact.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the forces that were measured by different instrumentation systems during a number of ship collisions with <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> is presented. Three types of instruments were used to measure ship impact forces: an inertial measurement system called MOTAN, a 5. 4 m 2 strain gauged area and a 3. 5 m 2 external Impact Panel. Forces on the Impact Panel were consistently lower than forces on the strain gauged area, for different impacts. The maximum force on the Impact Panel was 1. 2 MN, and the highest force on the strain gauged area was 5. 1 MN. Forces from MOTAN are calculated using two different approaches; one requires information about where the impact occurred, and the other does not. The agreement in forces from MOTAN and the strain gauged area or Impact Panel depended upon how completely the hull instrumentation captured the loaded area. When the strain gauged area provided good coverage of the loaded area (7 impacts), forces from MOTAN were from 17 % lower to 33 % higher than forces on the strain gauged area, if the impact location was {{used to calculate the}} forces. When the impact location was not used in the calculation, forces from MOTAN were up to 120 % higher than forces on the strain gauged area. The four most significant impacts to the Impact Panel, all of which extended beyond the Panel's sensing area, indicated that forces from MOTAN were from 11 % lower to 233 % higher than forces on the Impact Panel.

This paper documents iceberg data collected during the experiments, which include above water dimensions and underwater profiles, temperature profiles and samples of iceberg ice from the contact zone for microstructural analysis. The characteristic iceberg dimensions were scaled from photographs based on the measured range from the camera to the iceberg. The lengths of the icebergs impacted ranged from 4 to 73 m. A multibeam sonar was attached to the side of an auxiliary vessel and used to profile the icebergs during the impact experiment. Iceberg temperatures measured using a thermistor probe ranged from near zero at the surface to a minimum of - 15. 4 0 C at 60 cm into the core of the iceberg. Iceberg mass was stimated from photographs of profile and oblique views as well as underwater profiles obtained using the multibeam sonar. Masses of icebergs impacted ranged from 21 to 22, 000 tonnes. Characteristics of the virgin and impacted ice, as determined from the microstructural analysis, are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the current state}} of the art in the subject of iceberg and <b>bergy</b> <b>bit</b> motion during interaction and impact with offshore structures. Our particular interest in the present case is the influence of hydrodynamic interaction on change in velocity as small ice masses approach a larger structure in open water. Iceberg impacts are a design driver for structures located in offshore regions subject to drifting glacial ice. It is found that although many studies note that near-field effects influence the velocity and trajectory of drifting bergs prior to impact, the understanding of near-field hydrodynamic effects such as negative wave drift force, fluid cushioning, shadowing, reduction in impact velocity, and hydrodynamic damping, is incomplete. These effects are more obvious for small ice masses and bergy bits and although they have been identified qualitatively, there is very little quantitative information available. The inability to properly account for these phenomena generally leads to overestimation in impact velocity and consequently input impact energy. Better understanding of hydrodynamic interaction between small icebergs and offshore structures in very close proximity could improve load predictions by improving the estimation of input energy.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations {{have been conducted}} to examine the behaviour of small icebergs and <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> in unidirectional regular waves. A nonlinear time-domain method based on the equivalent motion concept and a corresponding computational algorithm are presented for predicting the motion and trajectory of small ice masses drifting in an open seaway and near a gravity base platform. The general equations of motion of a rigid body are applied, and the wave forces are determined as {{the sum of the}} resultant of wave-induced pressures integrated over the instantaneous wetted surface of the body (the Froude-Krylov forces) and the flow disturbance induced by the presence of the body as determined by the equivalent motion method. The algorithm is used to predict the motion and trajectories of free drifting and towed spherical models in small and large amplitude waves. The computed values are found to be in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements outside the heave resonance range where the motions are over-predicted. The motions of the ice mass are also simulated near a cylindrical gravity platform taking into account the effect of the waves diffracted by the structure. Large heave motions are predicted in close vicinity of the platform. In addition to instances where collisions were predicted, the ice drifted around or maintained a stationary position in front of the structure. It is concluded that the method can be applied to provide predictions of the kinematic parameters of motion of small bodies drifting in waves...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to climate}} change, {{production}} and transportation routes in Arctic regions {{are becoming more}} prevalent. When operating in Arctic waters, {{there is a significant}} risk of high energy encounters with smaller ice masses such as <b>bergy</b> <b>bits</b> and growlers. This study focuses on the structural response to high energy encounters in the surrounding water. The aim of the present work is the experimental validation of the Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) technique of the LS-DYNA code, which enables us to analyze the response of colliding bodies considering the surrounding seawater. Numerical simulations of a collision between an ice block and a floating structure have been carried out using the FSI analysis technique of the LS-DYNA code for a more realistic and accurate prediction of the impact loadings. To verify the fluid modelling in LS-DYNA, analyses were performed to determine the added mass coefficients for a spherical body and a rectangular block. The coefficients were compared to the added mass coefficients calculated in WADAM with the same geometry. The simulation results were compared with laboratory experiments where a floating structure was impacted with an approximately one ton ice block at a speed of 2 m/s. The impacted structure was treated as a rigid body. The ice behavior was modeled using the elliptic yield criterion and the strainbased pressure dependent failure criterion for granular freshwater ice proposed by Liu et al. (2011 a). The results of the numerical simulations compared favorably with actual experiments using freshwater ice blocks. The simulation produced reasonable values for the acceleration and load values, similar to those obtained in the laboratory experiments. The acceptable compatibility of the results proves that the FSI technique {{can be applied to the}} analysis of ship-ice collisions...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{observations}} form {{a crucial}} part of meteorological forecasts and are also used as input to climate models and for monitoring long-term climate trends and changes. But coverage at sea is much less dense spatially and temporally, especially at high latitudes. Passive underwater acoustics has been established for several decades as a good and reliable tool to monitor the weather. The frequency spectra of different weather types have been well documented and acoustic disdrometers have been developed in several research environments. Nevertheless, many questions remain about the validity of some of these measurements, the best analysis approaches and the combination of different weather processes. This is particularly true in polar regions, where the loud and complex acoustics of ice-related processes adds to the difficulty of the task. This thesis focuses on the analysis of a broadband dataset acquired in an Arctic fjord (Kongsfjord, Svalbard), in summer 2007. Taken at 6 locations {{from the mouth of the}} fjord to the glaciers at its termination, measurements cover the combination of varying levels of rain (from none to light rain), wind (from none to 11 km/h), ice (from none to growlers and <b>bergy</b> <b>bits),</b> shipping (from none to a large cruise ship) and animal activity (including whales and diving seabirds). The recordings covered frequencies from 100 Hz to 48 kHz. Principal-Components Analysis identified 3 distinct frequency bands mostly related to noise from wind, rain and ice. Laboratory-based tank experiments were conducted to assess the physical sources of these components (from 100 Hz to 100 kHz), confirming the acoustic role of ice and the relevance of the frequency bands identified by Principal-Component Analysis. These experiments also identified for the first time the role of higher (up to 45 kHz) acoustic frequencies in the identification of ice-related processes such as scraping, colliding and melting. Principal-Component Analysis is shown to be a valuable and rigorous tool for identifying weather processes at sea, especially in complex combinations of wind, rain, ice and other factors. Analyses at frequencies higher than generally used also offer the potential of identifying specific processes associated to the melting of glaciers and icebergs. This has paved the way for field measurements at glaciers around Svalbard in summer 2009. The approach presented here is now considered by the Meteorological Office (UK) for inclusion on operational present-weather sensors attached to moored or drifting buoys in polar and high-latitude regions in general.
