The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> the pantry and the refectory (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2m) walls with slit windows, {{to serve as a}} refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built {{in the shape of a}} Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections, and a sanctuary with three square apses. Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon.|$|E

It also includes a living room, although as the main room of the house, most meals would have been eaten in the main kitchen, equipped with an early range, boiler and hot air oven. Upstairs is a main bedroom and a second bedroom for children; to the rear (i.e. the colder, north side), are bedrooms for a servant and the servant lad respectively. Above the kitchen (for transferred warmth) is a grain and fleece store, with attached bacon loft, a narrow space behind the wall where bacon or hams, usually salted first, would be hung to be smoked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> fire (entering through a small door in the chimney).|$|E
500|$|The gate leads {{through to}} the Outer Ward which, when first built, would have been full of various {{administrative}} and service buildings.

The south-west tower {{may have been used}} either by the castle's constable, or by the castle's garrison, and also contained a bakehouse. On {{the south side of the}} ward is a range of buildings that included the great hall and chapel, sitting on top of the cellars, which are now exposed. The stubs and one surviving stone arches from the 1340s can still be seen. Behind the great hall was the tower used by the constable for detaining prisoners; this included a special room for holding prisoners, called the [...] "dettors chambre" [...] ("debtors' chamber") in the 16th century, and an underground dungeon. On the north side of the ward was a range of service buildings, including a kitchen, brewhouse and bakehouse, backed onto <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> tower, containing accommodation and store rooms.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the White Castle chain was rooted largely {{in the power of}} propaganda, {{something}} that was both an original innovation and necessary to change the public's negative perception of the hamburger. In 1931, it became the first restaurant to advertise in newspapers, using its old [...] "buy 'em by the sack" [...] slogan. White Castle also pioneered the concept of take-out service, and the restaurant is further known for being the first to market square burgers, called [...] "sliders", which were sold for five cents into the 1940s. White Castle was founded in March 1921 in Wichita, Kansas by Billy Ingram and his business partner, the cook Walter Anderson, and they opened a second restaurant in Kansas City in 1924. In 1932, White Castle created its first subsidiary: Paperlynen Company, which provided the cartons and wrapping paper that the food was served in, as well as the hats worn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> staff. It acquired porcelain companies in a similar fashion, placing them in charge of building small White Castle restaurants using white porcelain facades.|$|E
