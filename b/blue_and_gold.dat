5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold,</b> which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was {{like many of the}} other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.|$|E

Trail of the Torch is another university tradition that has continued to grow annually, where a pep rally is held in the Housing Quad with music, food, giveaways and dancing. After the pep rally, the torch of knowledge is lit and <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> candles are distributed to the crowd for the procession around the campus, trailing the torch from the Housing Quad to the torch in front of the Primera Casa building. Rage Week and Homecoming Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold.</b> An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), <b>Blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gold</b> (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> colours to all {{white in the}} 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Parramatta jersey used in 1947 {{was of a}} blue {{design with}} a single yellow hoop around {{the middle of the}} jersey, extending across the sleeves.

Over the years, the design has changed gradually from one based on <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> stripes to a design incorporating different <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> designs around the fringes of a predominantly blue or gold jersey.|$|E
