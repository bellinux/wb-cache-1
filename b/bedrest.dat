25|$|For 41 years, Gallitzin {{traveled}} the Allegheny Mountains, often in very difficult conditions, preaching, teaching, serving, praying and offering the sacraments. A doctor had recommended <b>bedrest</b> and warmth for the exhausted priest, {{but he was}} reluctant to curtail any of the Lenten or Holy Week services. Father Gallitzin ministered faithfully until the very end of his life, and after a brief illness, died at Loretto on May 6, 1840, shortly after Easter. He was buried near St. Michael's church in Loretto.|$|E
40|$|Fluid and caloric balance {{has been}} {{calculated}} for the Apollo 17 crew. This included measurement of nitrogen, water, and caloric value of the ingested food and the volume and nitrogen content of the excreted urine and feces. Body composition changes were determined from total body water and extracellular fluid volume differences. The body composition measurements {{made it possible to}} divide the weight loss into lean body mass and adipose tissue losses. From this division a caloric equivalent was calculated. These tissue losses indicated that the caloric requirements of the mission were considerably greater than the actual caloric intake. The 3. 3 kilo mean loss of body weight represented 1 kilo of lean body mass and 2. 3 kilos of adipose tissue. Calculated fluid balance was more positive during the mission than during the control period. These changes are unlike the body composition and fluid balance changes reported in <b>bedrested</b> subjects...|$|R
40|$|The total {{circulating}} blood volume (TCBV) and total body/venous haematocrit ratio (Htb/Hv) {{was determined by}} simultaneous measurement of the red cell volume (RCV) and the plasma volume (PV) in 10 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients, 10 supine <b>bedresting</b> control patients and 20 ambulant out-patients. The mean Htb/Hv of the SAH patients, 0. 866, {{was found to be}} significantly lower than that of the supine controls, 0. 908, and the ambulant patients, 0. 909, (p less than 0. 01). Using the ratio 0. 866 the total {{circulating blood}} volume of the SAH patients was calculated from either their RCV or their PV and compared with their measured TCBV. Expressed as a percentage of measured TCBV the mean errors of these single volume determinations were 2. 84 % and 1. 76 % respectively. The significance of these changes in the Htb/Hv ratio of SAH patients is discussed in relation to the circulatory disturbances they suffer...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{microgravity}} on {{body fluid}} distribution and electrolyte and hormonal levels of astronauts {{have been studied}} since the early manned space missions. <b>Bedrested</b> subjects {{have been used as}} controls to separate effects of microgravity from those of hypokinesia. These investigations have led to documentation of the physiological effects of spaceflight and to a unified theory of response to microgravity. During flight, crewmembers have decreased thirst and a net loss of body water, sodium, and potassium. These changes seem to be initiated by passive transfer of extracellular fluid resulting in increased central venous pressure (CVP), to which the homeostatic mechanisms respond. A new equilibrium state is maintained during flight; it does not change in response to negative calcium and nitrogen balances during flight. On reexposure to gravity, profound water and salt retention occurs to replete extracellular fluid. Attempts to avoid cardiac deconditioning by repleting water and salt before leaving microgravity have somewhat ameliorated postural hypotension but have had little effect on CVP, cardiac chamber size or electrolyte dynamics...|$|R
25|$|Most hip {{fractures}} {{are treated}} surgically by implanting an orthosis. Surgical treatment outweighs {{the risks of}} nonsurgical treatment which requires extensive <b>bedrest.</b> Prolonged immobilization increases risk of thromboembolism, pneumonia, deconditioning, and decubitus ulcers. Regardless, the surgery is a major stress, particularly in the elderly. Pain is also significant, and can also result in immobilization, so patients are encouraged to become mobile as soon as possible, often {{with the assistance of}} physical therapy. Skeletal traction pending surgery is not supported by the evidence. Regional nerve blocks are useful for pain management in hip fractures.|$|E
25|$|Lucius left in {{the summer}} of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus {{followed}} him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed. Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him. Fronto was upset at the news, but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of quiet <b>bedrest.</b> Lucius was better after three days' fasting and a bloodletting. It was probably only a mild stroke.|$|E
25|$|On September 17, 1925, Kahlo and {{her boyfriend}} and fellow Cachuca, Alejandro Gómez Arias, {{were on their way}} home from school when the wooden bus they were riding {{collided}} with a streetcar. Several people were killed, and Kahlo suffered nearly fatal injuries—an iron handrail impaled her through her pelvis, fracturing the bone. She also fractured several ribs, her legs, and her collarbone. She spent a month in the hospital and two months recovering at home, before being able to return to work. As she continued to experience fatigue and back pain, her doctors ordered x-rays, which revealed that the accident had also displaced three vertebrae. Her treatment included wearing a plaster corset, which confined her to <b>bedrest</b> for part of the three months she spent unable to walk.|$|E
40|$|Orthostatic {{intolerance}} {{remains a}} significant problem following space flight despite frequent use of the saline fluid-loading countermeasure and volitional use of an anti-gravity suite during reentry and landing. The purpose of this project {{is to examine the}} plasma volume (PV), endocrine, and orthostatic responses of <b>bedrested</b> subjects following 2 -hr and 4 -hr treatments of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and saline ingestion. Ten healthy men were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group A underwent a 4 -hr LBNP/saline treatment on best rest day 5 and the 2 -hr treatment on day 11. Group B underwent the 2 -hr treatment on day 6 and the 4 -hr treatment on day 10. Blood volume was determined before and after bed rest using radiolabelling. Changes in PV between measurements were calculated from changes in hematocrit and estimated red cell volume. Urinary excretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone (ALD) were measured each day during the study. Orthostatic responses were measured using a ramp LBNP protocol before bed rest, before each treatment, and 24 hours after each treatment. Both 2 -hr and 4 -hr treatments resulted in a restoration of PV to pre-bed rest levels which persisted at least 24 hours. This increase in PV was associated with significant increases in urinary excretion of ADH and ALD. Twenty-four hours after the 4 -hr treatment, the heart rate and pulse pressure response to LBNP were significantly lower and stroke volumes during LBNP were increased. Twenty-four hours after the 2 -hr treatment, {{there was no evidence of}} improvement in orthostatic responses. These results suggest that a countermeasure which simply restores PV during space flight may not be sufficient for restoring orthostatic responses...|$|R
2500|$|Hepburn and {{her family}} {{returned}} home to Switzerland to celebrate her last Christmas. As she was still recovering from surgery, {{she was unable to}} fly on commercial aircraft. Her longtime friend, fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, arranged for socialite Rachel Lambert [...] "Bunny" [...] Mellon to send her private Gulfstream jet, filled with flowers, to take Hepburn from Los Angeles to Geneva. She spent her last days in hospice care at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud and was occasionally well enough to take walks in her garden, but gradually became more confined to <b>bedrest.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's <b>bedrest</b> {{was over}} by late 1927, {{and she began}} socializing with her old school friends, who were now at {{university}} and involved in student politics. She joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM) and was introduced to a circle of political activists and artists — including the exiled Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella, and the Italian-American photographer Tina Modotti. At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most successful artists and a notable figure in PCM. They had met briefly in 1922, when he was painting a mural at her school. Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her {{to pursue a career}} as an artist. Rivera recalled being impressed by her works, stating that they showed, [...] "an unusual energy of expression, precise delineation of character, and true severity ... They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own ... It was obvious to me that this girl was an authentic artist".|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the Berlin <b>Bedrest</b> Study (BBR) {{proved that}} 10 minutes of {{vibration}} training 6 {{times a week}} prevented muscle and bone loss in total <b>bedrest</b> over 55 days (Rittweger et al. 2004, Felsenberg et al. 2004, Bleeker et al. 2005, Blottner et al. 2006).|$|E
50|$|Prolonged <b>bedrest</b> carries {{some medical}} risks such as decubitus ulcers, {{demineralization}} {{of the bones}} and atrophy of the muscles, {{as well as economic}} and social costs, and is much less commonly prescribed today than it formerly used to be. Preterm labor with threatened miscarriage remains one of the few conditions for which <b>bedrest</b> remains a standard treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bedrest</b> as {{a medical}} {{treatment}} refers to staying in bed day and night {{as a treatment for}} an illness or medical condition, especially when prescribed or chosen rather than resulting from severe prostration or imminent death. Even though most patients in hospitals {{spend most of their time}} in the hospital beds, <b>bedrest</b> more often refers to an extended period of recumbence at home.|$|E

50|$|He {{began writing}} for {{newspapers}} in 1858. His autobiography, My Life, dates from 1877, and was written {{to pass the}} time during forced <b>bedrest</b> after breaking his leg. He participated in the Diets of 1882, 1885, 1888 and 1891, and the Synod in 1876, 1886 and 1893.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{prone to}} orthostatic {{hypotension}} are the elderly, post partum mothers, and those having been on <b>bedrest.</b> People suffering from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa often suffer from orthostatic hypotension {{as a common}} side-effect. Consuming alcohol may also lead to orthostatic hypotension due to its dehydrating effects.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{treatment}} in lumbar disc disease is {{one or two}} days of <b>bedrest</b> (although growing number of studies shows that it makes little difference) and pain relieving medications. In cases with ongoing pain despite conservative treatments, a surgical operation that will remove the compressing disc material, a microdiscectomy or discectomy may be recommended to treat a lumbar disc herniation.|$|E
50|$|In early 2001, he was {{diagnosed}} by doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri with hepatitis, and given a month's <b>bedrest.</b> While his brother went home to Canada, Mohammed attended a 10-week program at Al Farouq training camp, where he declined an offer to become a trainer, before moving into a guesthouse in Kandahar where his brother later visited him.|$|E
50|$|Post spinal {{headache}} with nausea is {{the most}} common complication; it often responds to pain medications and infusion of fluids. It was long taught that this complication can be prevented by strict maintenance of a supine posture for two hours after the successful puncture; this has not been borne out in modern studies involving large numbers of people. Doing the procedure with the person on their side might decrease the risk. Intravenous caffeine injection is often quite effective in aborting these spinal headaches. A headache that is persistent despite a long period of <b>bedrest</b> and occurs only when sitting up may be indicative of a CSF leak from the lumbar puncture site. It can be treated by more <b>bedrest,</b> or by an epidural blood patch, where the person's own blood is injected back into the site of leakage to cause a clot to form and seal off the leak.|$|E
50|$|Lying, {{also called}} recumbency or prostration, or decubitus in {{medicine}} (from the Latin verb decumbere ′to lie down′), {{is a type}} of human position in which the body is more or less horizontal and supported along its length by the surface underneath. Lying is the most common position while being immobilized, e.g. in <b>bedrest</b> while sleeping or being struck by injury or disease.|$|E
50|$|Rachel Ames {{originated}} {{the role}} of Audrey in 1964 in what was originally a thirteen-week stint with an option for an additional thirteen weeks.

Maura McGiveney played Audrey temporarily while Ames was gone.|$|E
50|$|Erythema nodosum is {{self-limiting}} {{and usually}} resolves itself within 3-6 weeks. A recurring form does exist, and in children it {{is attributed to}} repeated infections with streptococcus. Treatment {{should focus on the}} underlying cause. Symptoms can be treated with <b>bedrest,</b> leg elevation, compressive bandages, wet dressings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are usually more effective at the onset of EN versus with chronic disease.|$|E
50|$|Disuse atrophy {{of muscles}} and bones, with loss of mass and strength, can occur after {{prolonged}} immobility, such as extended <b>bedrest,</b> {{or having a}} body part in a cast (living in darkness for the eye, bedridden for the legs etc.). This type of atrophy can usually be reversed with exercise unless severe. Astronauts in microgravity must exercise regularly to minimize atrophy of their limb muscles.|$|E
50|$|Serrano {{began writing}} in 2007 {{as a way}} to {{supplement}} his family's income when his pregnant wife was put on <b>bedrest.</b> After briefly writing for the Near Northwest Banner, Serrano freelanced for the Houston Press.

Broadcasting from the home became a trend followed by other homemaker hosts of the time.|$|E
5000|$|Muscle weakness, {{also known}} as muscle fatigue, (or [...] "lack of strength") refers to the {{inability}} to exert force with one's skeletal muscles. Weakness often follows muscle atrophy {{and a decrease in}} activity, such as after a long bout of <b>bedrest</b> {{as a result of an}} illness. There is also a gradual onset of muscle weakness as a result of sarcopenia - the age-related loss of skeletal muscle.|$|E
50|$|In January 2000, Watt {{fell ill}} with an {{infection}} of his perineum, forcing him into emergency surgery and nine weeks of <b>bedrest</b> in his San Pedro apartment. Initially unable {{to play his}} bass, he rebuilt his strength with intense practice as well as live club gigs where he performed sets of Stooges covers with Hellride in California and with J Mascis and Dinosaur Jr. drummer Murph in New York City under the name Hellride East.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{vibration}} {{training has}} been successfully applied in several <b>Bedrest</b> Studies of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Space Agency (DLR) where side-alternating vibration training was used to minimize {{the negative effects of}} simulated micro-gravity on muscle and bone loss. In addition the DLR successfully tested a Galileo Space vibration training device in several parabolic flight campaigns and showed that the application of vibration training is in fact feasible under zero gravity conditions.|$|E
50|$|Elevation of {{the head}} of the bed by {{approximately}} 45 degrees (so that the hyphema can settle out inferiorly and avoid obstruction of vision, as well as to facilitate resolution). <b>Bedrest</b> may be considered, although evidence suggests that it does not improve outcomes. Wearing of an eye shield at night time (to prevent accidental rubbing of the eyes during sleep, which can precipitate a rebleed). An eye patch should be worn throughout the day to protect the injured eye.|$|E
50|$|Since Gemini, {{exercise}} {{has been}} tried {{as a way of}} preventing bone loss, but it has not been shown to be successful. This may be in part due to lack of adequately designed studies (no controlled study had been done as of 2005, either in space or using <b>bedrest</b> as an attempt to simulate conditions which lead to bone loss). It is not known whether a different exercise regimen (perhaps including larger loads than past ones) would be effective.|$|E
