The party established its own English-language paper, The National Socialist, in May 1878 but managed to keep the publication alive only one year. The year 1878 saw the establishment of a more enduring newspaper: the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News). The Volkszeitung included material by the <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> of the German-American socialist movement, including Alexander Jonas, Adolph Douai, and Sergei Shevitch, and Herman Schlüter and quickly emerged as the leading voice of the SLP during the last decades of the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] In The Mismanagement of Talent, Brown and Hesketh {{argue that}} rooted within the {{dominant}} {{discourse of the}} 2 ̆ 2 war for talent 2 ̆ 2 are several core assumptions that have shaped our perspective on employability in the KBE. The most central of these {{is that there is}} a limited pool of talent capable of rising to senior managerial positions, which creates fierce competition to recruit <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>brightest.</b> <b>The</b> perception of talent as a limited commodity is seen as driving organizations to diversify their talent pools and adopt more rigorous recruitment and selection tools in an effort to get the right people, with the right knowledge, into the right jobs. That perception also shapes public policy, as governments focus on expanding access to higher education and dismantling barriers to talent presented by fundamental forms of inequality so that their work forces are positioned to compete in the global economy. Also affected are future knowledge workers themselves, who are pushed to acquire the employability skills that will ostensibly guarantee them the high-skilled, high-wage jobs generated within the KBE...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{a steady}} chorus of dignitaries has decried the low pay of federal judges <b>and</b> {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> federal judiciary {{is on the}} brink of losing its <b>best</b> <b>and</b> its <b>brightest.</b> <b>The</b> persistent nature of these claims should give us pause. Scott Baker 2 ̆ 7 s recent study empirically evaluates these claims by examining the relationship between judicial salaries <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work habits <b>and</b> voting patterns of federal appellate judges. If large pay disparities are indeed eroding the quality of the federal bench, Baker theorizes this likely results in more ideological voting, fewer dissents, longer delays in issuing opinions, and a self-selection of judges who are intent on maximizing their influence within the federal judiciary. To test these hypotheses, Baker undertook the formidable task of assembling the requisite datasets, which he then posted on the Internet for other researchers to use. Along with the ingenuity of his research design, we applaud Baker 2 ̆ 7 s industry and transparency. Thanks to his efforts, there is now an empirical literature surrounding the debate over federal judicial pay. At the end of his inquiry, Baker concludes that higher judicial salaries would have virtually no effect on the performance of federal appellate judges. The purpose of this Reply is to qualify Baker 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of his results, at least with regard to judges located in the 2 ̆ 2 Top Five 2 ̆ 2 legal markets of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. In his original analysis, Baker relies upon the average law firm partnership compensation, adjusted for years in practice and region, to estimate the forgone income - and hence opportunity costs - of each federal judge. Baker explicitly anticipated the possibility that this variable would understate the opportunity cost in large legal markets; thus, he included a Top Five variable plus an interaction term, which captures the effect of forgone earnings when a judge is located in one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s five largest legal markets. Baker 2 ̆ 7 s discussion, however, does not formally address the significance of the interaction term, which requires some additional steps to properly interpret. Based on our reanalysis of Baker 2 ̆ 7 s specifications, it appears that judges in the largest legal markets often behave differently than their smaller market counterparts. Specifically, the lower judicial salaries in Top Five markets strongly correlate with behavior Baker characterizes as 2 ̆ 2 ideological 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 influence-motivated. 2 ̆ 2 Conversely, while lower judicial salaries in small markets correlate with longer delays in issuing opinions, the exact opposite effect describes the behavior of judges in Top Five metropolitan areas. Our brief Reply proceeds as follows. Part I provides our reanalysis of Baker 2 ̆ 7 s data. Part II establishes an additional comparative context that allows us to speculate why Top Five legal markets may foster a more intense tradeoff of influence versus remuneration. Indeed, as we note, the real or perceived financial tradeoffs are so enormous - and conspicuous - in Top Five markets that federal judges may feel they have been lumped together with a large, faceless working class. We conclude by suggesting that the debate over judicial salaries is rooted in the more general problem of greater income disparity within the American legal profession...|$|R
