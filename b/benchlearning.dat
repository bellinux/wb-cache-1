40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to assess the relation between municipal benchmarking and organisational learning with a specific emphasis on <b>benchlearning</b> and performance within municipalities and between groups of municipalities in the building and housing sector in the Netherlands. The first and main conclusion is that this relation exists, but that the relative success of different approaches to dimensions of change and organisational learning are a key explanatory factor for differences {{in the success of}} <b>benchlearning.</b> Seven other important conclusions could be derived from the empirical research. First, a combination of interpretative approaches at the group level with a mixture of hierarchical and network strategies, positively influences <b>benchlearning.</b> Second, interaction among professionals at the inter-organisational level strengthens <b>benchlearning.</b> Third, stimulating supporting factors {{can be seen as a}} more important strategy to strengthen <b>benchlearning</b> than pulling down barriers. Fourth, in order to facilitate <b>benchlearning,</b> intrinsic motivation and communication skills matter, and are supported by a high level of cooperation (i. e., team work), a flat organisational structure and interactions between individuals. Fifth, <b>benchlearning</b> is facilitated by a strategy that is based on a balanced use of episodic (emergent) and systemic (deliberate) forms of power. Sixth, high levels of <b>benchlearning</b> will be facilitated by an analyser or prospector strategic stance. Prospectors and analysers reach a different learning outcome than defenders and reactors. Whereas analysers and prospectors are willing to change policies when it is perceived as necessary, the strategic stances of defenders and reactors result in narrow process improvements (i. e., single-loop learning). Seventh, performance improvement is influenced by functional perceptions towards performance, and these perceptions ultimately influence the elements adopted. This research shows that efforts aimed at <b>benchlearning</b> and ultimately improved service delivery, should be directed to a multi-level and multi-dimensional approach addressing the context, content and process of dimensions of change and organisational learning...|$|E

40|$|<b>Benchlearning</b> {{like new}} method {{integrates}} efficient methods {{and human development}} {{at a time when}} such integration is recognized as increasingly vital to organizational succes. It: -offers practical inspiration on improving quantitative goals -company performance and competitiveness-by influencing the attitudes of people within the organization -provides a new method combining the qualities of both the learning organization and knowledge management -shows how this concept can be applied using case studies and illustrations and the result of pilot project -describes practical perspectives and tools on management and learning theory. This work will be invaluable to senior and middle managers, consultants and practitioners and MBA students, as well all those working within organizations that are keen to improve and develop their performance. The aim is to produce a business strategy which will make organizations work more efficiently. Different aspects of ‘ the economics of learning’ have been the main content research. This work answers the question ’how do you know that your operation is efficient?’Benchlearning show {{that it is possible to}} move on from pure comparison to benefit from the knowledge and experience of others and create a real learning organization. Examples from a range of organizations including Ericsson show how to monitor efficiency, provide inspiration for a development drive, and illustrate how to influence people’s experience, in combination with the principles of organizational learning. <b>Benchlearning</b> principles can be applied to almost any group or company to promote a win-win-win situation: employees’ performance improves as they learn to develop, customers gain more value and choice, and owners benefit from a more competitive organization...|$|E

40|$|In {{these times}} of austerity, {{local governments are}} {{expected}} to deliver services in the most efficient and effective way. In order to achieve this objective, a greater emphasis is being placed on performance measurement tools in local governments. A widely used form of performance measurement is benchmarking. Within this context, the article aims to demonstrate how benchmarking {{can be used as}} an instrument for assessing and improving the performance of local service delivery. Two nonparametric frontier techniques, Free Disposal Hull (FDH) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), are used to benchmark local government performance in relative terms. The capabilities of the nonparametric frontier approach for benchmarking are explored by applying FDH and DEA models on four cases of local public libraries in Flanders. By incorporating all possible paths of expansion – both in space and in time – into one study, this integrated efficiency analysis can help entities to evolve towards <b>benchlearning</b> and improvement trajectories. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} research {{carried out}} in seven Portuguese organisations recognised by the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Model between January 2009 and August 2011. Using a qualitative methodology, based on case studies, we conducted semi-structured interviews {{to find out the}} motivations behind the adoption of the EFQM Excellence Model of self-assessment, as well the company’s current state of maturity, their route to improvement for a greater maturity level, their desirable future state of maturity, and finally, the definition of a methodology for using self-assessment based on the EFQM Model with all the inputs achieved in earlier stages. The main findings of this study are in accordance with other studies carried out across Europe, namely the fact that the internal motivations are the key factor for the implementation of the EFQM Excellence Model, the prevalence of Public organisations due the investment of National Authorities, the key role of CEOs and Top Managers and the ISO 9001 standard role in the successful implementation of several criteria of the model. A new methodology has been designed where the self-assessment team, <b>Benchlearning</b> and Benchmarking have a remarkable mission in the implementation process of the EFQM Excellence Model...|$|E
40|$|We {{claim that}} local {{e-services}} benchmarking studies summarized in indexes {{do little to}} enhance city managers' and academics' understanding of actual e-government performance, or to improve the e-services offered by cities. We undertook a different benchmarking approach, focused on learning best practices among cities, in late 2008 and early 2009. A <b>benchlearning</b> methodology (BLM) was developed, and a pilot study with 15 European cities was carried out. In this paper, we present the actual impact of the benchmarking study with respect to improvements in services, as the effectiveness of e-government benchmarking has rarely been evaluated. We discuss and analyse {{the results of a}} survey carried out in the same 15 cities four years after the pilot study. This paper presents evidence that BLM helped cities to identify good practices that they could learn from, and that some e-services were subsequently improved. The survey reveals that some changes are needed in the benchmarking methodology. The main one is the updating of the BLM bottom-up e-services catalogue, which is deeply discussed within the changing context of Smart Cities, especially the enlargement of the ecosystem of e-services to include citizens, the third sector, entrepreneurs, companies and other actors. A second one is the measurement of the adoption of e-services by citizens, also rarely assessed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the learning experience}} of a geothermal industry in organizing community development (comdev) programs for A and B subdistricts's priority locations in the C district in West Java province, Indonesia. There {{are a number of}} obstacles to the implementation of comdev programs, in which the programs are not designed based on needs and potential resources then adapted to the sociocultural condition of local community. Program and social mapping is carried out by rapid appraisal methods for the final purposes of program compatible to local community and potential conflicts identification. Capacity of local community is minimum for all aspects. In fact, they must be supported using programs (rescue and crash programs, empowerment programs, and rehabilitation programs) covering from basic needs to social needs. This qualitative research generates a reconstructive strategy to explore the best solution to overcome the complexities reflected on social map including potential conflicts related to the implementation of comdev programs. Using <b>benchlearning</b> approach and supporting method like cause and effect diagram, this reconstructive strategy is composed to increase effectiveness of comdev programs organization. The sociocultural is detected as root cause of low effectiveness of comdev program organization, so this need extraordinary efforts to support capacity building for local community. The next step, discussion offers social reengineering as a part of reconstructive strategy to overcome the complexities included critical factors and implications for that geothermal industry's management. In line with implementation of the reconstructive strategy, the coverage point of critical factors are resistance of local staff and local community, cost-effective paradigm, potential conflicts and the unique of programs. The implications, management might be using problem solving approach like think outside of the box: cost-effective leadership, comdev intelligence and coaching approach. Thus, a conceptual and action framework which is provided as a 15 -years-master plan from the year 2006 to 2020, that is supported by six excellent and innovative programs (comdev award, distance course, learning award, research award, 'peduli masyarakat adat", and open mind tour) is proposed and used to catalyze self reliance process of local community. For this purpose, this geothermal industry might need strategic alliance with competent external participants in the future...|$|E
