5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> climb the structure, they would have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E

50|$|As {{children}} refine their motor skills, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{help themselves}} by completing daily activities independently. For example, {{children between the}} ages of 2 and 3 <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dress and undress themselves without assistance. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut softer foods with a knife and <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tie his or her own shoes. Because all children develop at their own rate, the ages given are not an exact timeline.|$|R

They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> correctly conserve for solid quantities, but they <b>are</b> not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> complete conservation of number tasks. Orangutans <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> differentiate between same and different quantities of liquid but they <b>are</b> only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pseudoconserve, similar to children in {{the second stage of}} conservation development, and ultimately fail to correctly complete conservation of liquid tasks (see Age of conservation ability).|$|R
