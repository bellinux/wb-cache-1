Since technical education was chiefly composed of lecture and exercise, it should be planned so as one made the most of another effectively. Teaching materials, which were closely related to content of lecture, must be selected deliberately. Production of a dustpan, <b>book-ends,</b> glasslike metallic products, a screw Driver and a paper weight was suitable as teaching materials in metal working. Exercise gave students remarkable understanding on learning of metal working. As well as acquiring how to use manual tools and machine tools. Exercise Immediately after lecture also provided students with outstanding improvement of comprehension of teaching content. Guidance, which informed students that theory and method of metal processing was connected with metallic working products Use frequently in life, was required in technical education...|$|R

The outline of plastic working, casting, welding, machining and grinding was also explained. The dustpan, <b>book-ends,</b> glasslike metallic product, screw driver and paperweight were made in exercise using manual tools and machine tools. Heat treatment of steels containing 0. 1 to 0. 6 ％C was carried out and relation between tensile strength and heat treatment was investigated. Welding of steel plates and bending test of them were conducted. The outline of the discussion on the teaching of technical education was as follows. Since main affairs learned in lecture were adopted as teaching materials for exercise, students showed a keen interest in these matters, they practiced hardly, and they could understand sufficiently their teaching content. It was necessary for students to master practically the method of metal processing by use of manual tools and machine tools as well as to learn theory and technique of how to make products in the lecture...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{debate is}} currently underway in the inter-American human rights system involving the proper approach litigators, adjudicators, and advocates should take to supranational litigation of economic, {{social and cultural}} rights. Centered on questions of jurisdiction and the proper characterization and limits of justiciability, its resolution has tremendous implications for the tools available to on-the-ground advocates, their real-world effectiveness and sustainability in adjudicatory and advocacy contexts alike, and the rationalization of the system 2 ̆ 7 s developing jurisprudence over the long-term. This article <b>book-ends</b> a trilogy of pieces appearing in the NYU Journal of International Law and Politics by two sets of authors, each taking largely opposing views on the issue. One, represented in Less as More and Rejoinder: Justice Before Justiciability, advocates a norm-based approach to social rights litigation - with {{civil and political rights}} deemed appropriate for litigation, and social rights deemed inappropriate, even when they represent the same underlying facts and claims. The other, represented in Rethinking the 2 ̆ 7 Less as More 2 ̆ 7 Thesis and this counter-rejoinder, advocates a claim-based approach that is ambivalent to norm-based distinctions in the abstract. Rather, it looks to the long-term sustainability of the system 2 ̆ 7 s case-based jurisprudence by seeking to promote rationality and effectiveness in the adjudication of all rights, through proper duty-based adjudicatory standards and attention to the limits of system-specific justiciability doctrine. After putting the debate in larger context, and responding to Rejoinder 2 ̆ 7 s principal arguments, Counterrejoinder argues that the safest and most effective course for rights advocates in the Americas today is not to artificially limit litigation to one certain set of jurisdictionally-proper norms. This guarantees neither justice nor justiciability. Rather, it is precisely to privilege normative neutrality and technical precision in the framing of all human rights litigation, through proper attention to claim-based justiciability and a genuine embrace of the wishes, visions, priorities, and social justice agendas of the communities with which we work, whatever these may be. Indeed, the role of lawyers should not be in limiting litigation options a priori, but in explaining, in normatively-neutral and technically-precise ways, the full set of tools available to local groups and allowing them to decide their preferred strategic course based on their own self-assessed needs, priorities, and visions for their struggle...|$|R
5000|$|An old, bespectacled gentleman, an open {{volume in}} his hands, {{sits in his}} library, in a rocking chair, in his {{stocking}} feet, comfortably before a warm fire. A clock above the mantle strikes (the face apparently reading about five, {{but the number of}} rings indicating eight) and the gentleman, rising, sets the open book down on his seat; yawning and stretching, he makes his way across the room, a well-used, lit taper in his hand, which he sets on a table near the threshold, extinguishing the flame with a great breath as he exits. We cut back to the rocker and the open book, Alice in Wonderland, out of which who should emerge but Alice herself! Up leaps the tiny girl to the arm of the chair, up she leaps to a nearby table, the which she runs across until she meets a radio, whose great dial she adjusts with some effort. The song of the title comes through, our little heroine swaying and scatting her way through it. Merrily she rolls along, skipping and sliding past some untidily shelved volumes, out of one of which, Robinson Crusoe, emerges some accompaniment, likely Robinson himself and Friday. Meanwhile, Rip Van Winkles book snores away; the cover is pushed away by Rip, apparently awakened by and much enjoying the music. Alice trots along, coming across The Three Musketeers, whose cover she pries open: [...] "All for one and one for all," [...] cry Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, raising their rapiers as they segue into their own scatting-routine. Cut to Robinson, Friday, Napoleon, and Omar Khayyam, who stand amongst the books bobbing about happily to the tune. There is a universal burst of applause as the musketeers conclude their number: Henry VIII, surrounded (presumably) by some of his wives, shouts [...] "Whoopee!" [...] Nearby, Marc Antony crawls out of Antony and Cleopatra, shouting, as if in Julius Caesar, [...] "Friends, Romans, countrymen...lend your ears to that dear old maestro!" [...] The camera pans to a portly Emperor Nero, who stands before a book containing an image of the Great Fire of Rome and holds his iconic, anachronistic fiddle. He plays an exotic tune: Cleopatra comes dancing out of her book, looking like an Egyptian tomb-painting. Alice skips over to Uncle Toms Cabin, summoning its title character: Uncle Tom sings Stephen Fosters Old Black Joe as well as [...] "Ive Got the South in my Soul," [...] the other characters his chorus (Alice occasionally interjecting, [...] "O Lord!") Snarling, Mr. Hyde peeps out from his book, meaning trouble as he clutches one of the skull-shaped <b>book-ends</b> that contain his volume: he snatches Alice as the song concludes; on a high shelf, Tarzan takes notice, crying valorously as he swings down to the table by way of a couple of pull switches. The manly figure stands in Hydes way, prompting the cad to turn and run: Robinson and Friday snatch up a nearby fountain pen as Hyde comes close and they spray his devilish face full of black ink. In an effort to clean himself, Hyde ejects Alice only to find, once he can see again, that two Roman soldiers are advancing towards him with a lit pipe; as they gain on their adversary, one of the soldiers blows into the tail of pipe, scalding Hydes bottom with a breath of fire. Robin Hood loads his tiny bow with a match whose tip, as Robin pulls back his string, rubs against the coarse side of its box, igniting as it hurtles towards the villain; Hyde runs away in a panic as projectile after projectile thus flies at him: but, again, the fiend has nowhere to run, for, in the other direction, the musketeers are loading steel pen-points into a pencil sharpener, winding the sharpeners crank in order to fire the nibs as though bullets from a gatling. Overwhelmed, Hyde leaps into a small hinged box nearby and, as he cowers there, four of the characters shut the lid and carry the box away in the fashion of pall-bearers; a dirge plays as they drop the ersatz coffin {{from the edge of the}} table into a waste-paper basket at its foot.

5000|$|Started by {{executive}} producer Jackie Smith, the [...] "Love in the Afternoon" [...] promos, {{for the majority}} of the campaign's decade-long run, featured a simulated sunrise against a blue sky, with the sun centering itself and then flashing to reveal the ABC logo zooming in against a different background.

5000|$|Hudson argues {{this might}} be a {{literary}} device, used in some classical writings, to conceal the name of the author of a literary work. Furthermore, Prior argues that the play Othello refers to a location in the town of Bassano, and that the title of the play might refer to the Jesuit Girolamo Otello from the town of Bassano. The character Emilia speaks some of the first feminist lines on an English stage and could thus be seen as a contemporary allegory for Amelia Bassano herself, while the musicians in both plays, Prior argues, are allegories for members of her family. For these and other reasons it has been argued [...] that Lanier herself was a co-author of these plays, and especially of the 1623 First Folio version of Othello which contains 163 key lines not present in the 1622 Quarto. In addition, Hudson believes that another 'signature' exists in Titus Andronicus where there are an Aemilius and a Bassianus each holding a crown. Each of these mirrors the other's position {{at the beginning and end}} of the play as rhetorical markers indicating that the two names are a pair, and <b>book-end</b> the bulk of the play.

40|$|The {{economics}} of environmental federalism identifies two <b>book-end</b> departures from the first-best, which equates marginal {{costs and benefits}} in all local jurisdictions. Local governments may respond to local conditions, but ignore inter-jurisdictional spillovers. Alternatively, central governments may internalize spillovers, but impose uniform regulations ignoring local hetero-geneity. We provide a simple model that demonstrates that the choice of policy depends crucial-ly on the shape of marginal abatement costs. If marginal costs are increasing and convex, then abatement cost elasticities will tend to be higher around the local policies. This increases the deadweight loss of those policies relative to the centralized policy, ceteris paribus. Using a large simulation model, we then empirically explore the tradeoffs between local versus second-best uniform policies for US air pollution. We find that US states acting in their own interest lose about 31. 5 % of the potential first-best benefits, whereas the second-best uniform policy loses only 0. 2 % of benefits. The centralized policy outperforms the state policy for two reasons. First, inter-state spillovers are simply more important that inter-state hetero-geneity in this application. Second, welfare losses are especially small under the uniform policy because elasticities are much higher over the relevant range of the cost functions. ...|$|E

Some evidences of typical conditions leading to bow-echo development {{were present in the}} environment: a moderate to high CAPE and a vertical wind shear with a high magnitude in the first 2. 5 km above ground level. Besides, satellite information displayed the evolution of a mesoscale convective system with a pattern and time length similar to the expected for bow-echoes. Unfortunately, this suspicion could not be strictly confirmed as no radar exists in the Chaco area. In order to explore the possible formation and evolution of a bow-echo in this region given the related phenomena typically produced by these convective systems as severe winds, heavy precipitation and tornadoes, a mesoscale numerical model was used as a tool to simulate this real storm case. The numerical tool used is the ARPS mesoscale model developed by the University of Oklahoma. The ARPS model was initialized with the radiosounding launched at Resistencia (12 UTC), and convection was triggered by warm bubble in an otherwise homogeneous environment. Since the complicated enviromental wind profile, in terms of multiple changes in the vertical shear vector that makes a complex hodograph, two different numerical experiments have been performed. The first one (E 1) was run with a smoothed hodograph in order to approach the evolution from a more idealized wind profile configuration. A second experiment with the real wind profile (E 2) was conducted to compare real versus ideal conditions. The evolution in the experiment E 1 exhibited an explosive development with a complete cell splitting below 5 km with a stronger intensification of the left flank updraft, coherent with the anticlockwise veering of the wind hodograph in the Southern Hemisphere. Later in the simulation the convective arrangement acquired a typical bow-echo configuration with strong rotational downdrafts in the apex of the convective line (<b>book-end</b> vortex) and a slight intensification of the wind in the rear part of the convective system at low-levels (¡ 6 2 km). Experiment E 2 displayed similar features to E 1 but with a reinforcement of the right updraft instead, although the persistent character of its left cell. This persistence was explained by the merging of new developments at the gust-front in the eastern sector. The significant features of a bow-echo were more evident in the real experiment (E 2). Both experiments exhibited extremely cold tops, in agreement with cold temperatures in the infrared satellite images. Pages: 2081 - 208...|$|E
