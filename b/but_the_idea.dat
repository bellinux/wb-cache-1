5|$|After the Chile benefit, Ochs and Dylan {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} a joint concert tour, playing small nightclubs. Nothing came of the Dylan-Ochs plans, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> eventually evolved into Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue.|$|E
5|$|Only Kronshtadts hull {{survived the}} war {{reasonably}} intact {{and was about}} 10% complete in 1945. She was judged obsolete and the Soviets considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was rejected and both hulls were scrapped in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Quatermass and the Pit film, Kneale was {{approached}} by Hammer about writing a fourth Quatermass story directly for them, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> came to nothing.|$|E

5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that it could be}} used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Alan Rickman voiced Absolem, the Caterpillar. Rickman was {{originally}} {{going to have}} his face composited onto the animated Caterpillar. He was filmed recording his voice in the studio, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was eventually scrapped. The animators did, however, try to give Absolem's face characteristics similar to Rickman's.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> marched on, <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> marched on, just {{as though}} men's brains {{were no more}} than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was {{thinking}} them!...|$|R

50|$|On {{the eve of}} the French Revolution of 1789, France was in a {{profound}} institutional and financial crisis, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of <b>the</b> Enlightenment had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.|$|R
5|$|Ho Yi as the Hotel {{manager and}} Chinese special agent Mr. Chang. In early drafts of the script, it was Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) who aided Bond in Hong Kong, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> fell through and Chang {{was created to}} replace her.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, {{the first}} motor bus service in Buckinghamshire began running between Newport Pagnell and Olney, {{followed}} by numerous other routes, which took traffic {{away from the}} railway line. Despite this, the LNWR considered electrification of the line in 1904, believing such a scheme would bring about considerable savings, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> never materialised.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Bart and Lisa {{attending}} a military academy had previously been pitched, and had been floating around since 1991. The idea {{had not yet been}} used as an episode plot, because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to a strange place early in the series.|$|E

30|$|Very few works [89] discuss {{mobility}} {{management in}} the context of cognitive radios. In [90], a joint mobility and spectrum management scheme is studied focusing on cellular networks, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> are also interesting for CR-VANETs.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{fascinating}} {{thing is}} that anthropology is anti-hegemonic {{in many of the}} questions it asks, and is threatened in many places. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> produced within anthropology are still generative far beyond the discipline." [...] Nov. 2008 ...|$|R
5|$|Announced in May 2014, {{development}} on Far Cry 4 began {{immediately after the}} shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues 3s story, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was later scrapped and the team decided {{to develop a new}} setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Holly Compton (September 10, 1892– March 15, 1962) was an American {{physicist}} {{who won the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his 1923 {{discovery of}} the Compton effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation. It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{as part of}} the {{changing}} Soviet policy towards its ethnic territories, a decision was made to increase the proportion of ethnic Russians in the autonomous oblast. On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of the autonomous oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the administrative center of the autonomous oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E
50|$|Brook {{claims that}} the West isn't at war with terrorism, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> {{ideology}} of Islamic totalitarianism. He repeatedly says that just like in World War II, America wasn't at war against Japanese Kamikaze pilots or German tanks, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of Nazism and Japanese Imperialism.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} person-centred care {{has grown to}} be internationally {{associated}} with successful outcomes of the health care. Initially, the method was developed for senior patients and patients with intellectual disabilities <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> have later spread to other medical fields.|$|R
5|$|ILM {{digitally}} recreated {{the vast}} majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man to be included in the film, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Kevin Smith {{said that}} he was open to having the Superman Lives script be adapted as an {{animated}} film, with Nicholas Cage voicing Superman and Michael Rooker voicing Lex Luthor. In October 2017, Batman vs. Two-Face writer Michael Jelenic stated that he originally pitched an animated film based on Smith's Superman Lives script, saying that Warner Bros seriously considered it for a long time. According to Jelenic, Cage would have loved to voice Superman in the film, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> never materialized and Jelenic's pitch was eventually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1937, {{she brought}} her corps to Nanchang, where she reunited with her old friend Chen Yi, who was by then a top {{commander}} of the Communist New Fourth Army. According to Hu's own account, {{they fell in love}} and became engaged. She wanted her women's corps to join the Communist rather than the KMT army, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was rejected by the New Fourth Army commander Xiang Ying, who feared it might cause trouble with the KMT leadership.|$|E

60|$|Roland gazed attentively; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> {{recalled}} to {{his mind}} were so inconsistent with the mean and servile dress of the person before him, {{that he did not}} venture to express the opinion which he was irresistibly induced to form.|$|R
60|$|But though words, as {{they are}} used by men, can {{properly}} and immediately signify nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> {{that are in the}} mind of the speaker; yet they in their thoughts give them a secret reference to two other things.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} premiere of , Jerry Bruckheimer stated {{it was the end}} of the trilogy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a {{spin-off}} was still possible. After the film's successful opening weekend, Dick Cook, then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, said he was interested in a fourth installment. Los Angeles Times also reported that rights to a book were bought. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and only resumed in mid-2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured {{that not only}} was the trackbed kept whole, but the majority of the rail infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was turned down.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} botanical gardens is {{closely linked to}} the history of botany itself. The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were {{medicinal}} gardens, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, strange, new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. Later, in the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany.|$|E
