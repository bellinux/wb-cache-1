50|$|The {{predominant}} base {{contributing to}} <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> is bicarbonate.

50|$|A further {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} actual and standard base excess: actual <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> is that present in the blood, while standard <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> is the value when the hemoglobin is at 5 g/dl.

50|$|Comparison of the <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> {{with the}} {{reference}} range assists {{in determining whether}} an acid/base disturbance {{is caused by a}} respiratory, metabolic, or mixed metabolic/respiratory problem. While carbon dioxide defines the respiratory component of acid-base balance, <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> defines the metabolic component. Accordingly, measurement of <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> is defined, under a standardized pressure of carbon dioxide, by titrating back to a standardized blood pH of 7.40.|$|E
50|$|In physiology, <b>base</b> <b>excess</b> {{and base}} deficit refer to an excess or deficit, respectively, {{in the amount}} of base present in the blood.

Arterial and venous blood samples were collected at 5 minutes and at 12, 24, 72 and 96 hours of age. Blood {{gas analysis}} was performed by aportable analyzer, measuring arterial and venous total carbon dioxide (TCO 2), carbondioxide partial pressure (pCO 2), oxygen partial pressure (pO 2), oxygen saturation (SO 2),bicarbonate (HCO 3), <b>bases</b> <b>excess</b> (BE), pH, and lactate (LT).
