5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E

5|$|Wilder {{began his}} career on stage, and made his screen debut in an episode of the TV series The Play of the Week in 1961. Although his first film role was portraying a hostage in the 1967 motion picture <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde,</b> Wilder's first major role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1968 film The Producers {{for which he was}} {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This was {{the first in a series}} of collaborations with writer/director Mel Brooks, including 1974's Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which Wilder co-wrote, garnering the pair an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Wilder is known for his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and for his four films with Richard Pryor: Silver Streak (1976), Stir Crazy (1980), See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989), and Another You (1991). Wilder directed and wrote several of his own films, including The Woman in Red (1984).|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Wilder {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks. A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde.</b> After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E

During this trying time, Chloe reconnects with Kevin, and they become engaged following Delia's recovery. Mob princess Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo) arrives in town and develops a crush on Kevin. Her father Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr) blackmails Kevin into leaving Chloe at the altar and marry Angelina, which he does. Once Angelina leaves town, Chloe and Kevin marry and resume their courtship. The couple join forces with Adam (Michael Muhney) and Chelsea Newman (Melissa Claire Egan) to start a fashion website entitled TagNGrab. The site ends unsuccessfully, leaving Chloe and Kevin in need of money. In a <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> themed story arc, they steal money to save their house. Their marriage flounders as Kevin continues to steal and lets Chloe spend a night in jail for his crime, and they decide to get a divorce, which particularly affects Delia who adored her stepfather. During this period Chloe develops a fashion line for Jabot's fashion division with her best friend, Chelsea. Months later, Chloe and Kevin decide to start over and begin dating again. On the night of Delia's performance in a play, Billy leaves Delia and her dog, Dash, alone in his car while purchasing ice-cream. Dash runs off, causing Delia to run after him.

25|$|Burbank has a rich {{cinematic}} history. Hundreds {{of major}} feature films have filmed in Burbank over the years, but perhaps none more famous than Casablanca (1942), starring Humphrey Bogart. The movie began production {{a few months}} after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Due to World War II, location shooting was restricted and filming near airports was banned. As a result, Casablanca shot most of its major scenes on Stage 1 at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, including the film's famous airport scene. It featured a foggy Moroccan runway created on the stage where Bogart's character doesn't fly away with Ingrid Bergman. <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> (1967) was also filmed at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios.|$|E
25|$|The reforms proved positive, {{and the new}} Ranger force {{eventually}} {{regained the}} status of a respectable agency. Under the command of captains such as Frank Hamer (who later became famous for leading the party that killed the outlaws <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde),</b> the Rangers displayed remarkable activity in the following years, including the continuous fighting of cattle rustlers, intervening in the violent labor disputes of the time and protecting the citizenry involved in Ku Klux Klan's public displays from violent mob reaction. With the passage of the Volstead Act and the beginning of nationwide prohibition on January 16, 1920, their duties extended to scouting the border for tequila smugglers and detecting and dismantling the illegal stills that abounded along Texas's territory.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this film's {{commercial}} success, Kramer helped spur on Hollywood to reform its film marketing practices when it was observed that the film was doing excellent business everywhere in the US, including the southern states where it was assumed that films with African American lead actors would never be accepted. As a result, the prominent presence of Black actors in films would never again be considered a factor in Hollywood film marketing and distribution. However, Kramer, bothered by the film's negative reviews and wanting respect as an important film artist like François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, undertook a nine college speaking tour to screen the film and discuss racial integration. The effort proved a dispiriting embarrassment for him with college students largely dismissing his film and preferring to discuss less conventional fare like <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> directed by Arthur Penn.|$|E

25|$|Lampião {{was joined}} in 1930 by his girlfriend, Maria Déia, nicknamed Maria Bonita ("Pretty Maria"). His {{relationship}} with Maria Bonita gave his reputation {{some of the}} 'romance and violence' notoriety enjoyed in the USA by <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde.</b> The women who joined bandit groups, often termed cangaceiras, dressed like their male comrades and participated in many of their actions. Maria and Lampião had a daughter, named Expedita, in 1932. A number of cangaceiras joined the band over the many years of its existence and Lampião usually attended any births these women had personally. Such children, including Lampião's own, were fostered out to settled relatives or friends of the cangaceiros, or left with priests. Expedita, after the deaths of her parents, was raised by her uncle, João. João Ferreira {{was the only one}} of Lampião's brothers not to become an outlaw.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Truffaut {{directed}} his third movie, Jules and Jim, a romantic drama starring Jeanne Moreau. Over the next decade, Truffaut had {{varying degrees of}} success with his films. In 1963, Truffaut was approached to direct an American film called <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde,</b> with a treatment written by Esquire journalists, David Newman and Robert Benton intended to introduce the French New Wave to Hollywood. Although he was interested enough to help in script development, Truffaut ultimately declined, but not before interesting Jean-Luc Godard and American actor and would be producer, Warren Beatty, the latter of whom proceeded with the film with director Arthur Penn. As for Truffaut, his first non-French film was an 1966 adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel Fahrenheit 451, showcasing Truffaut's love of books. His only English-speaking film was a great challenge for Truffaut, because he barely spoke English himself. This was also his first film shot in color. The larger scale production was difficult for Truffaut, who had worked only with small crews and budgets.|$|E
25|$|It {{was quickly}} decided that The Wild Bunch, which had several {{similarities}} to Goldman's work, would {{be produced in}} order to beat Butch Cassidy to the theaters. By the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay into what became The Wild Bunch. Filmed on location in Mexico, Peckinpah's epic work {{was inspired by a}} number of things—his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde,</b> America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War, and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but the crude men attempting to survive the era. Starring William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ben Johnson, Warren Oates, Strother Martin, Jaime Sánchez, and Edmond O'Brien, the film detailed a gang of veteran outlaws on the Texas/Mexico border in 1913 trying to survive within a rapidly approaching modern world. The Wild Bunch is framed by two ferocious and infamous gunfights, beginning with a failed robbery of the railway company office and concluding with the outlaws battling the Mexican army in suicidal vengeance prompted by the brutal torture and murder of one of their members. Irreverent and unprecedented in its explicit detail, the 1969 film was an instant success. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences, characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, were perfected in The Wild Bunch. Many critics denounced its violence as sadistic and exploitative. Other critics and filmmakers hailed the originality of its unique rapid editing style, created {{for the first time in}} this film and ultimately becoming a Peckinpah trademark, and praised the reworking of traditional Western themes. It was the beginning of Peckinpah's international fame, and he and his work remained controversial for the rest of his life. The film was ranked No. 80 on the American Film Institute's top 100 list of the greatest American films ever made and No. 69 as the most thrilling, but the controversy has not diminished. When The Wild Bunch was re-released for its 25th anniversary, even though it received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, the depiction of violence, especially in the opening robbery sequence, had been significantly edited to soften its impact. Nonetheless, the film continues to be powerful even after so many years. Peckinpah received his only Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for this film.|$|E

Daredevil shows like the globe of death which features motorcycles performing inside an enclosed sphere or a high diving act were sometimes included. Burlesque shows (slang term: kootch shows) were also part of the traveling carnival for a time as well. Displays like <b>Bonnie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clyde's</b> death car or Hitler's staff car were also seen at some traveling carnivals.|$|R
