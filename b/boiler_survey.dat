2500|$|In 1946, Mr Edhouse of Totnes {{purchased}} {{four of the}} RMLs, {{and converted}} them for use as passenger vessels on a ferry service from Torquay to Brixham, across Torbay in South Devon. [...] The ferry had been run up until 1934 by the Devon Dock, Pier & Steamship Co, but had then lapsed, due to the vessel used, SS King Edward failing her <b>boiler</b> <b>survey.</b> The four RMLs were named Western Lady, Western Lady II, Western Lady III and Western Lady IV. [...] All were re-engined, as their original engines used a fuel with too high an octane value for passenger service; in any case, the original Hall-Scott Defender Petrol engines had been removed prior to sale by the Admiralty {{and returned to the}} USA under the World War II lease-lend agreement. This reduced their top speed from 20 knots to 14 knots. [...] In addition to the ferry service, the Western Ladies were also used on excursions, especially to the River Dart. [...] The company was sold in 1963, to Torbay Boat Construction Co Ltd, of the Dolphin Boatyard in Galmpton, with little effect on the operation, though the launches were a familiar sight at the Dolphin Boatyard for their winter layup – in the summer the whole fleet was moored on buoys in Brixham Harbour. [...] In 1967 Western Lady III spent some time running cruises around Dublin Bay, under the sponsorship of the Irish Government.|$|E
5000|$|BA 552 (ex NZR) 4-8-0. Owned by Les Hostick. Previously on {{static display}} at Te Awamutu Railway Museum, leased to Mainline Steam in 1994. Restored to {{mainline}} standard in 1999, although certification has since lapsed.

5000|$|AB 699 {{is owned}} by the Pleasant Point Railway & Historical Society, and runs {{regularly}} on their line between Pleasant Point and Keanes Crossing, a distance of 2 km. It was restored to operating condition in the late 1970s despite pressure from NZR to fill the boiler with concrete as the locomotive was originally placed at Pleasant Point station as a static display. It is currently undergoing a 10-year <b>boiler</b> <b>survey</b> as of March 2014.|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the safety conditions of steam boilers in companies associated with a professional risk administra-tion company in Antioquia, Colombia. To this end, their op-eration conditions shall be characterized, the associated risks identified, and their safety level assessed. Methodology:. a descriptive crosssectional study {{was carried out in}} twenty companies whose production processes involve <b>boilers.</b> A <b>survey</b> on the conditions for operation was applied on both the maintenance managers and the boilers’ operators in each company. A hazard risk assessment matrix was made as in-structed in the GTC- 45 Colombian technical guide, and an assessment instrument was applied {{to determine}} the safety level for each boiler. Results: 70 % of the assessed boilers obtained a low score (less than 65 points) according to the scale, which has been validated by experts; the remaining boilers obtained an acceptable score (66 to 81 points). It was also found that 85 % of the boilers had no operating instructions, and 60 % of them did not have any kind of alarm. Conclusions: the stud-ied boilers had poor security conditions, mainly related to the absence of operation protocols, boiler operator training, and poor supervision by competent authoritie...|$|R
