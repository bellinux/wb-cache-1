40|$|AbstractTopical agents {{containing}} vitamin D 3 (VD 3) analogues such as calcipotriol, maxacalcitol and tacalcitol and {{the combination}} of calcipotriol/betamethasone <b>dipropionate</b> (<b>betamethasone)</b> are prescribed for patients with psoriasis. However, they are known to occasionally cause hypercalcemia, {{and the frequency of}} hypercalcemia is suggested to vary according to the VD 3 analogue used. In this study, to address the reason for these differences, the calcemic effects of maxacalcitol-, calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments in rats were evaluated. The serum calcium levels in rats treated with ointments containing maxacalcitol, but not calcipotriol or calcipotriol/betamethasone, were significantly elevated, which is consistent with clinical observations. The serum concentration of VD 3 analogue in rats treated with ointments containing calcipotriol and calcipotriol/betamethasone was lower than that in rats treated with maxacalcitol-containing ointment. Thus, the calcemic effects appear {{to be associated with the}} systemic exposure of VD 3 analogues in rats. To understand the mechanism underlying the different systemic exposures of VD 3 analogues, skin permeation and metabolic stability of VD 3 analogues were evaluated. The cumulative amount of calcipotriol permeated through rat skin was significantly lower than that of maxacalcitol. On the other hand, the metabolic clearance of calcipotriol in rat hepatocytes was higher than that of maxacalcitol. Similar results were obtained using human skin and human hepatocytes. The current study demonstrates that the lower calcemic effects of calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments are caused by the low systemic exposure of calcipotriol according to low skin permeability and rapid hepatic elimination after topical application...|$|R

Those at increased risk for HPA axis suppression are those who are more likely to absorb more of the steroid through the skin. These groups include: ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Calcipotriol and <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> {{are both}} proven {{products}} in the topical treatment of psoriasis. The efficacy and tolerability of a new ointment containing these two compounds has been assessed in six phase III clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: To compare the results obtained in the clinical studies of the new calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment. METHODS: A total of 6050 patients with psoriasis {{took part in the}} six randomized, double-blind studies. The two-compound product was compared with each of the active constituents, either in the new ointment vehicle or in the marketed formulation. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment the mean reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ranged from 65 to 74 % with the two-compound product applied once or twice daily, from 46 to 59 % with calcipotriol alone and from 57 to 63 % with <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> alone. The tolerability profile of the two-compound product was similar to <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> monotherapy and better than calcipotriol alone.

40|$|Background: Calcipotriene and <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> are topical {{treatments}} for psoriasis vulgaris. Their {{mode of action}} is different. Improved risk/benefit may result with concomitant use of the two compounds together. A new vehicle has been created {{with the objective of}} obtaining optimal stability of both calcipotriene and <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in the combination product. Objective. We compared the clinical efficacy of a fixed combination of calcipotriene and betamethasone clipropionate in a new vehicle to calcipotriene in the new vehicle, betamethasone in the new vehicle, and the new vehicle alone. Methods: This was an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 4 -week study in patients with psoriasis vulgaris amenable to topical treatment. Results. The mean percentage reduction in PASI from baseline to end of treatment was 73. 2 % in the combination group (n = 301), 48. 8 % in the calcipotriene group (n = 308), 63. 1 % in the <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> group (n = 312) and 28. 8 % in the new vehicle group (n = 107), (P <. 001).

40|$|Scalp {{psoriasis}} {{occurs in}} 50 %- 75 % {{of patients with}} plaque psoriasis. It {{may be the only}} area of the body affected, or it may be associated with disease elsewhere, including psoriatic arthritis. Most cases are treated topically, usually with steroids and/or calcipotriol. In 2008, Health Canada and the US FDA approved a stable, once-daily 2 -compound gel containing calcipotriol and <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (Xamiol®, LEO Pharma; Taclonex Scalp®, Warner Chilcott). This once-daily therapy improves patient quality of life with a quick onset of action and greater efficacy than monotherapy with either ingredient or twice daily treatment with calcipotriol 0. 005 % (Dovonex®, LEO Pharma) scalp solution. The gel vehicle was developed for ease of use, improved cosmetic acceptability and absorption on the scalp. By 2 weeks, approximately 60 %, and by 8 weeks, approximately 70 % of patients have controlled disease (i. e., absent or very mild disease).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{need for}} new {{treatments}} for scalp psoriasis, as many topical treatments are cosmetically unacceptable and difficult to apply, resulting in poor compliance. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of a new, once-daily, two-compound scalp formulation (Xamiol; LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) containing calcipotriol 50 microg g(- 1) plus betamethasone 0. 5 mg g(- 1) (as dipropionate), with the active ingredients as single compounds in the same vehicle. METHODS: This 8 -week, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, randomized adult patients with scalp psoriasis involving > 10 % of the scalp to the two-compound scalp formulation (n = 568), <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 0. 5 mg g(- 1) (n = 563), or calcipotriol 50 microg g(- 1) (n = 286). The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with 'absence of disease' or 'very mild disease' according to investigators' assessments at week 8. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with 'absence of disease' or 'very mild disease' at week 8 was significantly higher in the two-compound group (68. 4 %) than the <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (61. 0 %, P = 0. 0079) or calcipotriol (43. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) groups. The proportion of patients rating their scalp psoriasis as 'clear' or 'almost clear' was significantly higher for the two-compound scalp formulation (69. 6 %) than for <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (59. 9 %, P = 0. 0006) or calcipotriol (44. 7 %, P < 0. 0001).

Therefore, sixteen patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis received 15 mg alefacept IM for 12 weeks, followed by a 12 -week follow-up period. The first 4 weeks, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to either <b>betamethasone</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> or the vehicle cream, once daily. Plaque severity (SUM) was assessed and serial biopsies were immunohistochemically stained for T-cell subsets (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, CD 45 RA, CD 2, CD 25, GITR), cells expressing NK-receptors (CD 94 and CD 161), epidermal proliferation (Ki 67) and differentiation (K 10), which were quantified using manual and digital image analysis. Alefacept monotherapy resulted in statistically significant improvement in plaque severity. Subsequently, immunohistochemical assessments on T-cell subsets, epidermal proliferation (Ki 67) and keratinization (K 10) revealed marked time-related improvements with respect to the mentioned parameters, without significant differences between both treatment regimens.
