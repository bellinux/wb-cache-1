50|$|Top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processing</b> are terms used to {{describe}} the differences in memory processing when observing same-race and other-race faces. <b>Bottom-up</b> <b>processing</b> puts together pieces of a whole and develops one grand picture. Top-down processing uses more initial cognitive work by breaking down the whole picture into pieces, and then analyzing those pieces. <b>Bottom-up</b> <b>processing</b> is used in processing same-race faces, and requires much less brain activation than top-down processing, which is used while processing other-race faces. When bottom-up brain processing is used while viewing same-race faces, a holistic face in perceived, encoded and remembered. When top-down brain processing is used while viewing other-race faces, only features of the face are perceived and encoded. Once the face is perceived by the VT cortex, the hippocampus is used to encode the memory in the parietal lobe. Overall, same-race faces undergo better memory encoding processes than other-race faces because they are remembered more often, however, other-race faces that are remembered undergo a more effortful memory encoding process. More brain activation is needed to effectively encode an other-race face. Memory encoding isn't the only found cause of the cross-race effect; memory retrieval is also involved. In retrieving a memory, the parietal lobe is reactivated. When retrieving an other-race face, there is more reactivation of the parietal lobe, meaning more effort is needed to retrieve an other-race face memory. The frontal lobe is also activated while observing other-race faces if the parietal lobe is unable to retrieve the memory, acting as a search engine in the brain looking for the location of the memory.|$|E
5000|$|Wishful seeing {{has been}} {{observed}} to occur in early stages of categorization. Research using ambiguous figures and binocular rivalry exhibit this tendency. Perception is influenced by both top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processing.</b> In visual processing, <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processing</b> is a rigid route compared to flexible top-down processing. Within <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processing,</b> the stimuli are recognized by fixation points, proximity and focal areas to build objects, while top-down processing is more context sensitive. This effect can be observed via priming {{as well as with}} emotional states. [...] The traditional hierarchical models of information processing describe early visual processing as a one-way street: early visual processing goes into conceptual systems, but conceptual systems do not affect visual processes. [...] Currently, research rejects this model and suggests conceptual information can penetrate early visual processing rather than just biasing the perceptual systems. This occurrence is called conceptual or cognitive penetrability. Research on conceptual penetrability utilize stimuli of conceptual-category pairs and measure the reaction time to determine if the category effect influenced visual processing, [...] The category effect is the difference in reaction times within the pairs such as Bb to Bp. To test conceptual penetrability, there were simultaneous and sequential judgments of pairs. The reaction times decreased as the stimulus onset asynchrony increased, supporting categories affect visual representations and conceptual penetrability. Research with richer stimuli such as figures of cats and dogs allow for greater perceptual variability and analysis of stimulus typicality (cats and dogs were arranged in various positions, some more or less typical for recognition). Differentiating the pictures took longer when they were within the same category (doga-dogb) compared between categories (dog-cat) supporting category knowledge influences categorization. Therefore, visual processing measured by physical differential judgments is affected by non-visual processing supporting conceptual penetrability.|$|E

5000|$|Feature search (also {{known as}} [...] "disjunctive" [...] or [...] "efficient" [...] search) is a visual search process {{that focuses on}} {{identifying}} a previously requested target amongst distractors that differ from the target by a unique visual feature such as color, shape, orientation, or size. An example of a feature search task is asking a participant to identify a white square (target) surrounded by black squares (distractors). In this type of visual search, the distractors are characterized by the same visual features.

50|$|If {{people use}} their prior {{knowledge}} or experience to perceive an object, {{they are less}} likely to make mistakes, or illusory conjunctions. In order to explain this phenomenon, Treisman and Souther (1986) conducted an experiment in which they presented three shapes to participants where illusory conjunctions could exist. Surprisingly, when she told participants that they were being shown a carrot, lake, and tire (in place of the orange triangle, blue oval, and black circle, respectively), illusory conjunctions did not exist. Treisman maintained that prior-knowledge played an important role in proper perception.

In addition, both native and non-native speakers perceived the present and absent nasals significantly more than liquids. The only difference between native and non-native speakers was the lexical support for perception; while native speakers perceived the present and absent phoneme in words better than non-words, non-native speakers perceived the present and absent phoneme in words and non-words equivalently (a significant three-way interaction among noise, phonemes, and lexicality, and a significant four-way interaction among noise, phonemes, lexicality, and language factors).

5000|$|There exist both {{overlaps}} {{and differences}} {{in the areas of}} the brain that are responsible for endogenous and exogenous orientating. Another approach to this discussion has been covered under the topic heading of [...] "bottom-up" [...] versus [...] "top-down" [...] orientations to attention. Researchers of this school have described two different aspects of how the mind focuses attention to items present in the environment. The first aspect is called <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processing,</b> also known as stimulus-driven attention or exogenous attention. These describe attentional processing which is driven by the properties of the objects themselves. Some processes, such as motion or a sudden loud noise, can attract our attention in a pre-conscious, or non-volitional way. We attend to them whether we want to or not. These aspects of attention are thought to involve parietal and temporal cortices, as well as the brainstem.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{knowledge}} is recruited when individuals {{need to provide}} reasons for their decision. The need to provide reasons evokes an information-processing strategy that relies on top-down application of rules and principles instead of <b>bottom-up</b> <b>processing</b> that relies on personal knowledge. This can be explained {{with the help of}} the supposition that individuals feel the pressure to conform when asked to provide reasons, as they don't want to be the outsiders. When they are not asked to explain their choices, they feel freer to rely on their personal knowledge. It has been found that Chinese have a significantly lower tendency to compromise, which earlier on has been found to be one of their characteristic traits, when not asked to provide reasons for their consumer decisions. Americans, on the contrary, are more likely to compromise when they are not accountable to provide explanations for their choice.|$|E
50|$|Bottom-up {{processes}} {{are characterized by}} an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing. It primarily relies on sensory information and incoming sensory information is {{the starting point for}} all <b>Bottom-up</b> <b>processing.</b> Bottom-up refers to when a feature stands out in a visual search. This is commonly called the “pop-out” effect. Salient features like bright colors, movement and big objects make the object “pop-out” of the visual search. “Pop-out” features can often attract attention without conscious processing. Objects that stand out are often given priority (bias) in processing. <b>Bottom-up</b> <b>processing</b> is data driven, and according to this stimuli are perceived {{on the basis of the}} data which is being experienced through the senses.Evidence suggests that simultaneously presented stimuli do in fact compete in order to be represented in the visual cortex, with stimuli mutually suppressing each other to gain this representation. This was examined by Reynolds and colleagues, who looked at the size of neurons’ receptive field’s within the visual cortex. It was found that the presentation of a single stimulus resulted in a low firing rate while two stimuli presented together resulted in a higher firing rate. Reynolds and colleagues also found that when comparing the neural response of an individually presented visual stimulus to responses gathered from simultaneously presented stimuli, the responses of the concurrent presented stimuli were less than the sum of the responses gathered when each stimuli was presented alone. This suggests that two stimuli presented together increase neural work load required for attention. This increased neural load creates suppressive processes and causes the stimuli to compete for neural representation in the brain.Proulx and Egeth predicted that brighter objects would bias attention in favor of that object. Another prediction is that larger objects would bias the attention in favor of that object. The experiment was a computer-based visual search task, where participants searched for a target among distractions. The results of the study suggested that when irrelevant stimuli were large or bright, attention was biased towards the irrelevant objects, prioritizing them for cognitive processing. This research shows the effects of Bottom-up (stimulus-driven) processing on biased competition theory.|$|E
