40|$|A dimension-forming {{model has}} been constructed, with the {{hereditary}} relations taken into account; {{the effect of the}} pre-treatment of the work {{on the quality of the}} micro-arc oxidized (MAO) coating has been determined; it has been found out that the preliminary transformation of the surface of the work contributes to enhancing the microhardness of the coating by 40 %, the degree of the wear becomes twice as low. A normal character of the distribution of the coating thickness, its roughness, thickness mullite and the variation in size of the work after its micro-arc oxidation has been revealed. The formulae obtained relate the above parameters to the technological MAO factors. Methods of designing the process of the MAO part treatment have been devised; they consider the MAO coating formation features found out during the experimental studies.
