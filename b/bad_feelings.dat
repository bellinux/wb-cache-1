5|$|Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon {{initially}} {{agreed to}} take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison had apparently stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr's commitment had never been in question, and he interrupted the filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> caused by the Beatles' legal problems on their break-up.|$|E

5|$|Despite the <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> {{generated}} at Damietta, Amalric still {{refused to}} abandon his dream of conquering Egypt, and he continued to seek {{good relations with the}} Byzantines in the hopes of another joined attack, which never took place. In 1171 Amalric came to Constantinople in person, after Egypt had fallen to Saladin. Manuel was thus able to organise a grand ceremonial reception which both honoured Amalric and underlined his dependence: for the rest of Amalric's reign, Jerusalem was a Byzantine satellite, and Manuel was able to act as a protector of the Holy Places, exerting a growing influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.* H. E. Mayer, The Latin East, 657 In 1177, a fleet of 150 ships was sent by Manuel I to invade Egypt, but returned home after appearing off Acre due to the refusal of Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to help.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E

50|$|Because it {{is uncomfortable}} to {{experience}} bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually {{to do something}} to make the feelings diminish. By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or <b>bad</b> <b>feeling,</b> the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement—the mind learns that the way to avoid the <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions. When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.|$|R

Another recommendation was for greater caution before allowing off-duty crew members to occupy flight deck seats. Two of the pilots' unions protested the way the inquiry was conducted.|$|E

25|$|When {{the revival}} {{launched}} in 1988, Mark Goodson {{had not even}} considered former host Richard Dawson to return due to lingering <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> between Dawson and the production team. After hiring Ray Combs, Goodson threw his loyalties behind him and refused to consider changing hosts despite the slipping ratings. However, the younger Goodson {{did not have the}} ties to Combs that his father did and felt that a change would at least require consideration. After meeting with his staff, Goodson offered Dawson a contract to return as host of the syndicated Feud and the semi-retired Dawson agreed to return. Combs finished out the remainder of the season but, upset by the decision to replace him, he departed from the studio as soon as he signed off on the final episode of his tenure.|$|E
25|$|With two {{controversial}} races, {{the trip}} to England generated both <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> and bad press for Courtney and the Cornell rowing team. The controversial first heat with Leander caused ill will in England with many considering that Cornell acted in an unsportsmanlike manner. Courtney believed he received good treatment from the fans at Henley, and was mistreated by the English press. Courtney also {{had to contend with}} bad press back home. Courtney believed that part of the problem was the rivalry between competing wire services. C. S. Francis, a Cornell alumni who helped raise money for {{the trip to}} England, was also the editor of the Troy Times, which was associated with United Press. Francis stayed with the Cornell team and helped out United Press reporters with information about the team. The Chicago Associated Press wanted to have their own representative. When this was denied, Courtney claimed that they tried to get even. Courtney insisted that several things that Chicago Associated Press reported, such as troubles and disagreements between members of the team and Mr. Francis' saying the drawing of the Leander rowing club was fixed, were fabrications. After the regatta, the members of the Cornell rowing team released a statement to the press to address the matter of the Leander race. It stated that it was their understanding that under the rules if they stopped they would have been disqualified. They also said they would consider another race with Leander if they would have won.|$|E

She explained: [...] "There are no <b>bad</b> <b>feelings.</b> Look, she's a very accomplished, powerful producer and she couldn’t get there by being petty and bitchy. Her back is to the wall. She had to cut people out because she had to balance her budget." [...] In January 2013, Francis returned to the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital.|$|E

500|$|Massachusetts raised {{two full}} regiments, totalling nearly 1,000 men; New Hampshire {{provided}} 60 men, Rhode Island provided 80, and {{a company of}} Indians from Cape Cod was also recruited. [...] Recruiting was difficult in Massachusetts {{due to the lack}} of enthusiasm for the endeavour, and authorities were forced to draft men to fill the ranks. [...] Connecticut was also asked to contribute to the expedition, but declined, citing <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> over the return of Port Royal by treaty after its capture in 1690. The force, which was placed under the command of Massachusetts Colonel John March, totalled 1,150 soldiers and 450 sailors, and was carried by a fleet of 24 ships, including the 50 gun man of war [...] under the command of Captain Charles Stuckley, and the 24 gun colonial Province Galley of Cyprian Southack.

500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> as people. But with these songs, I think {{we really wanted to}} paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's what some of the parts of being human are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{increasing}} mainstream success, Sylvester {{continued to}} reaffirm his {{connection to the}} gay community of San Francisco, performing at the main stage at the 1979 Gay Freedom Day parade. Further, during his summer 1979 tour of the UK, he performed at the London Gay Pride Festival in Hyde Park. That same year, Sylvester met the singer Jeanie Tracy through Harvey Fuqua, and they immediately became friends. A large black woman, Sylvester felt that Tracy would work well with his Two Tons O' Fun, and invited her to join his backing singers, which she proceeded to do. Subsequently, befriending the Tons, she would work for Sylvester {{for the rest of}} his life. The Tons themselves were convinced by Fuqua to produce their own self-titled album, from which came two dance chart hits, [...] "Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven" [...] and [...] "Just Us"; as a result, they began to work less and less with Sylvester, only joining him on occasion for his live shows. In some interviews he would express bitterness at their departure, while in others he stressed that he had no <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> toward them.|$|E
500|$|The last {{performance}} of the original Experience lineup took place on June 29, 1969, at Barry Fey's Denver Pop Festival, a three-day event held at Denver's Mile High Stadium that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience. The band narrowly escaped from the venue {{in the back of}} a rental truck, which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle. Before the show, a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day, Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career, blaming Hendrix's plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later commented: [...] "Mitch and I hung out a lot together, but we're English. If we'd go out, Jimi would stay in his room. But any <b>bad</b> <b>feelings</b> came from us being three guys who were traveling too hard, getting too tired, and taking too many drugs... I liked Hendrix. I don't like Mitchell." ...|$|E
