5|$|Following its {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, Burma had been fighting against ethnic unrest and Chinese Nationalist Kuomingtang irregulars, and several <b>Burmese</b> Army officers had trained in Australia in the 1950s. A <b>Burmese</b> staff officer, Major Muang Muang, later requested the assistance of Serong or another Australian officer. As a result Serong was sent to Burma as a counter-insurgency instructor with the <b>Burmese</b> armed forces, lecturing senior officers {{for a few months}} in 1957 before returning to Australia. Serong subsequently advocated the dispatch of a small team of Australian officers to assist in training the <b>Burmese,</b> but this did not occur. At the request of Muang Muang, Serong returned to Burma in 1960, serving in Rangoon as a strategic adviser to the <b>Burmese</b> armed forces. Muang Muang had resigned in early 1961, and as a consequence Serong's influence was limited from this time, During this period he worked to prepare the <b>Burmese</b> for a border war against China. While in Burma Serong's expertise brought him {{to the attention of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and as a result he was later invited to supervise counter-insurgency programs in Vietnam. In February 1962 he wrote to Pollard, by then CGS, to suggest the deployment of a small team of Australian officers under his command to South Vietnam to work with the US advisory group there. Soon after the <b>Burmese</b> Army staged a coup, seizing control and moving the country towards communist China, after which Serong made arrangements to leave.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Burmese</b> forces {{chose to}} retreat via the Mae Lamao pass (in modern-day Mae Sot, Tak). In retreat, {{they tried to}} plunder the ancient and wealthy town of Kamphaeng Phet but the town was too well fortified. With the help of more Portuguese mercenaries, the Governor {{repelled}} the <b>Burmese</b> with flaming projectiles that forced the <b>Burmese</b> to cease using their cannons and protect them with coverings of damp hides.|$|E
5|$|The {{casus belli}} {{have been stated}} as a <b>Burmese</b> attempt to expand their {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the <b>Burmese,</b> began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the <b>Burmese</b> forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three <b>Burmese</b> armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The <b>Burmese</b> forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the <b>Burmese</b> negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Ngasaunggyan broke {{the back of}} <b>Burmese</b> defenses. The <b>Burmese</b> army lost several {{thousand}} men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the <b>Burmese</b> lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient <b>Burmese</b> capital of Tagaung, about 380km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found {{the heat of the}} searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the <b>Burmese</b> to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another <b>Burmese</b> stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief {{of the invasion}} force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the <b>Burmese</b> fort at Ngasaunggyan. The <b>Burmese</b> chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the <b>Burmese</b> army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The <b>Burmese</b> withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.|$|E
5|$|This time, the <b>Burmese</b> king {{received}} the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. The <b>Burmese</b> chronicles {{say that the}} king was so insulted {{that he had the}} envoys executed. But both <b>Burmese</b> inscriptional evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed. At any rate, the imperial envoys did not get back to Yunnan in due time. The newly formed Yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route.|$|E
5|$|Just {{one month}} into the siege, the <b>Burmese</b> command decided to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{bird species}} {{seen in the}} park are both migratory and {{resident}} avifauna species. Some of the avifauna are the East Himalayan pied kingfisher, black kite, lesser sky-lark, northern hill myna, <b>Burmese</b> pied myna, North Indian black drongos, lesser eastern jungle crow, yellow headed wagtail, spotbill duck, blue-winged teal, ruddy shell duck, hooded crane, <b>Burmese</b> sarus crane, Indian white-breasted waterhen and crimson-breasted pied woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of <b>Burmese</b> pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial American alligator populations in the Everglades may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north. While events of predation by <b>Burmese</b> pythons on young alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect has been seen on overall American alligator populations.|$|E
5|$|The Siamese {{success at}} {{repelling}} the <b>Burmese</b> {{would not be}} repeated. This first ever invasion gave the <b>Burmese</b> an important experience on fighting with Siamese. The next invasion would be conducted by Bayinnaung, a man accustomed to fighting against Siamese soldiers and familiar with marching through Siamese terrain. The unrest in Burma delayed that next invasion for fifteen years, until the War of 1563 or the War of the White Elephants.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} initially met little resistance, as the <b>Burmese</b> {{forces were}} {{too large for}} the small guard posts around the border. Upon hearing of the <b>Burmese</b> invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at Suphanburi, a town just west of Ayutthaya. When Tabinshwehti and his army arrived at the walled town of Kanchanaburi, they found it completely deserted. About a month into the invasion, mid-November 1548, the King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru and Chorakhe Sam Phan. The <b>Burmese</b> continued their advance and captured the ancient town of Uthong {{as well as the}} villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closing in on Suphanburi. When the <b>Burmese</b> attacked the town, Siamese defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the Chao Phraya river near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli plain.|$|E
5|$|The {{succession}} crisis Ayutthaya {{is portrayed}} in the 2005 English language Thai film The King Maker. The film ends prior to the <b>Burmese</b> invasion.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a border war in 1277–78. It was reported {{mainly in the}} Yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of Marco Polo. Although the <b>Burmese</b> chronicles have no record of the border war, a 1278 <b>Burmese</b> inscription mentions the army's defeat at Ngasaunggyan. The Mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the <b>Burmese</b> chronicles, the <b>Burmese</b> command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E
5|$|After the treaty, the <b>Burmese</b> king rested {{for eight}} days, and {{returned}} to Pegu. He arrived back at Pegu on 1 March 1549 (3rd waxing of Late Tagu 910 ME).|$|E
5|$|In January 1287, {{the embassy}} arrived at Beijing, and was {{received}} by the Yuan emperor. The <b>Burmese</b> delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He {{did not want to}} invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The <b>Burmese</b> embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287, and reported the terms to the king.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat saw the <b>Burmese</b> army's retreat as an {{opportunity}} {{take advantage of their}} weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of Siamese territory. For three days, the Siamese chased the invaders, inflicting great losses upon them. Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces {{on both sides of the}} road. The Siamese in their eagerness fell into the trap. The <b>Burmese</b> captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat, {{being unable}} to repel the <b>Burmese,</b> {{sent a message to}} his {{son-in-law}} Maha Thammaracha at Phitsanulok, ordering his vassal to come to his aid by bringing an army southwards towards Ayutthaya and if possible to engage the enemy in battle. Thammaracha quickly mobilized his forces {{and with the help of}} the Governor of Sawankhalok, marched southward with a large army to attack the <b>Burmese</b> rear. Upon hearing of this and on the advice of Bayinnaung; Tabinshwehti decided to withdraw, abandoning the mission altogether. His decision was compounded by news from Burma that the Mons, who had never been entirely subjugated by the Taungoo dynasty, rebelled in the absence of the king. Other factors included the scarcity of supplies and sickness in his army, which was not prepared for a long siege.|$|E
5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: <b>Burmese</b> Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. <b>Burmese</b> Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies in}} 2007 based on feline DNA {{showed that there}} are very few genetic {{differences}} between the Singapura and <b>Burmese,</b> adding support to the claim that the Singapura is not a natural breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} venom {{had a single}} {{evolutionary}} origin has been called into question by a 2015 study, which found that venom proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the <b>Burmese</b> python. The study therefore suggested that venom had evolved independently {{in a number of}} snake lineages.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} defense preserved Siamese {{independence for}} 15 years. Still, {{the war was}} not decisive. The next <b>Burmese</b> invasion in 1563 would force a Siamese surrender in February 1564, and make Ayutthaya a vassal state of Burma for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made {{preparations}} for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Persian Khwarezmid Empire {{under the command of}} Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central Asians. On the <b>Burmese</b> side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid-1283, a <b>Burmese</b> army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan.|$|E
5|$|When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi {{was well}} aware of the {{military}} power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a <b>Burmese</b> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <b>Burmese</b> king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (အပိ) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action.|$|E
5|$|Although Utica's {{population}} is predominantly European American, it has diversified since the 1990s. New immigrants and refugees have included Bosnians (displaced by the Bosnian War), Russians, <b>Burmese,</b> Vietnamese, and Latinos. More than 15 languages are spoken in the city. Utica {{has a low}} cost of living but its industrial and economic decline have posed difficulties for people {{trying to make a}} new start.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, the {{remaining}} Siamese forces retreated. Tabinshwehti readied his army for a siege of the Siamese capital. He made his camp {{north of the}} city, with his headquarters at Klum Dong, and had his commanders encamp in strategic places surrounding the city walls, Bayinnaung at Phaniat, the Viceroy at Ban Mai Makham, and the Governor of Bassein at the plain of Prachet. The <b>Burmese</b> would not, however, take the Siamese capital so easily.|$|E
5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the <b>Burmese</b> had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. The <b>Burmese</b> had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it fairly easy to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he swung open the gates of the city and dared the <b>Burmese</b> King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, <b>Burmese,</b> and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the <b>Burmese</b> chronicles claim the Siamese king had agreed to pay an annual tribute. Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted {{a little over a}} year in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just a year after the Siamese {{campaign}} on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping spheres of influence. (During his 1554–1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye, not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim on the region by setting up a <b>Burmese</b> garrison at Tavoy, in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later.|$|E
5|$|During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, {{six weeks}} before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, <b>Burmese.</b> Police later {{discovered}} that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison and released after three. The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of <b>Burmese</b> monarchs, offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way. Food and other offerings, {{sheltered}} by a Royal white umbrella, were taken in a procession from the palace, escorted by a Minister, as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state.|$|E
5|$|Gambira was {{released}} during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 {{as part of}} the 2011–2012 <b>Burmese</b> political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012.|$|E
5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in <b>Burmese,</b> French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1274, {{the former}} Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as {{governor}}. In May 1275, the governor sent {{a report to}} the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the <b>Burmese</b> evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1548 (13th waxing of Tazaungmon 910 ME), the <b>Burmese</b> three armies left Martaban {{to start}} the invasion. The armies marched along the Ataran river toward the Three Pagodas Pass, entered Siam along the Khwae Noi River {{to the town of}} Sai Yok, then {{overland}} towards the Khwae Yai River. From there they travelled by boat toward the town of Kanchanaburi. Tabinshwehti travelled in great state with a massive retinue of elephants and servants. Many of these elephants carried muskets and bronze cannon; these were kept close to the king. Royal elephants were rafted across rivers, while the ordinary war elephants marched upstream to a ford. The <b>Burmese</b> king was accompanied by his crown prince Bayinnaung, Bayinnaung's thirteen-year-old son Nanda, and many richly attired lords. Hundreds of workmen marched ahead of the king's retinue, to pitch a richly decorated wooden camp, painted and gilded for the King's use, only to pack it up and pitch it at a new location every day.|$|E
5|$|Rise of the Rajas was {{released}} December 19, 2016. It {{is set in}} Southeast Asia, and adds four civilizations (<b>Burmese,</b> Malays, Khmer, and Vietnamese; {{each with its own}} fully voice-acted campaign: Bayinnaung, Suryavarman I, Gajah Mada, and Lê Lợi) as well as a new map type with environments, units, improved AI and more.|$|E
