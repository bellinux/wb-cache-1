It is unknown whether patients with Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> can utilise an attentional strategy, and what effect this strategy {{would have on the}} premovement cortical activity. Movement-related potentials were recorded from 12 Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and controls performing externally cued finger tapping movement, allowing an examination of cortical activity related to movement performance and bradykinesia in this disease. All subjects were tested in two conditions, which differed only by {{the presence or absence of}} the cognitive strategy. The Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> group, unlike controls, did not produce a rising premovement potential in the absence of the strategy. The Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> group did produce a rising premovement potential for the strategy condition, but the early slope of the potential was significantly reduced compared with the control group 2 ̆ 7 s early slope.

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between androgens, cognition and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings: It {{has been found that}} low circulating levels of androgens are a risk factor for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased circulating androgens are also associated with declining cognitive performance, particularly in memory-related tasks. Conversely, androgen supplementation to hypogonadal men results in improved memory performance. It has therefore been hypothesized that androgen supplementation may be beneficial in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In recent studies, animal models have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this relationship between androgens and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies have shown that androgen depletion results in increased levels of beta amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, changes which are thought to be associated with subsequent neuronal death. Summary: Androgen depletion results in molecular changes associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Further human trials are needed to determine whether androgen modulating therapy for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> has clinical significance...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state. Taken together our findings emphasize the central role of dopamine in integrated striatal function and the pathological consequences of striatal dopamine denervation in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

Twelve Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and sex- and age-matched controls performed a bimanual cranking task at two speeds (0. 5 Hz, 1. 5 Hz) and phase relationships (in-phase, anti-phase), with and without an external metronome cue. Data were sampled at 200 Hz, and raw displacement data for each hand, {{mean and standard deviation}} measures of the relative positions of the two hands and their velocities were then calculated. All participants could perform the in-phase movement, at both speeds; however, the Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients were more variable and less accurate than the control participants, particularly at the fast speed. While controls could perform the anti-phase movement, in which rotation of the cranks differed by 180 degrees at both speeds, Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients were unable to do so at either speed, reverting to the in-phase movement at the slow speed.
