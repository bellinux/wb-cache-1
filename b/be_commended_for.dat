500|$|Copeland's {{score was}} {{generally}} well-received, though several critics sharply {{disagreed with the}} general consensus. Publications like PSXExtreme thought the music helped bring atmosphere to the varied worlds, and Allgame enthused that [...] "Insomniac should <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> realizing the importance of music in games; it seems to enhance the whole experience." [...] Others, such as Joseph Parazen of Game Revolution, thought the background music sounded [...] "identical to every other 3D, cartoony, action platformer I've ever played". Other points of praise were the voice acting and character development. Among complaints aside from the story included the game camera, which could be difficult to control and led to unjustified enemy attacks. Some publications warned that the game might feel too much like its predecessors, with a similar plot and objectives.|$|E

Nonetheless, the Scottish Government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production. In 2005 the aim was for 18% of Scotland's electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010, rising to 40% by 2020. In 2007 this was increased to 50 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2020, with an interim target of 31 per cent by 2011. The following year new targets to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 were announced and then confirmed in the 2009 Climate Change Delivery Plan.

500|$|Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News {{praised the}} film's humour and performances: [...] "The anger and hatred one often {{associates}} with a revenge tale is missing"; humour takes over, {{and the film}} [...] "busts the notion that revenge tales must be laden with gore and violence". According to Deepa Gauri of the Khaleej Times, Maheshinte Prathikaram is a boon for a Malayalam cinema with an [...] "identity crisis". She praised the film's screenplay and direction: [...] "Every frame shows the minute detailing, which gives [...] its real heart.

Raj Vikram of Metromatinee.com also gave a positive review: [...] "There {{is not a single}} scene in the film which appears cooked up ... He [...] must <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> being sure-footed about what he intended to portray". Vikram praised the performances by Faasil and the supporting cast, the [...] "magnificent camera" [...] and the [...] "songs which seamlessly and melodiously merge with the narrative", concluding that it [...] "is a movie that is true to itself.

500|$|For the [...] "Batgirl: A Matter of Family" [...] story pack, Stapleton {{offered a}} mixed reaction, giving the DLC a 6.3 out of 10, praising the unique design and {{atmosphere}} of the theme park setting, and also commenting positively on the story, the variation in combat, Batgirl's character design, and Mark Hamill's performance as the Joker. A prominent concern, however, was the short length of the campaign and lack of replay value aside from the rather simple collectables found around the map. He added, [...] "worse, there’s no new AR challenge map where you can play as Batgirl, which means her great-looking character model is trapped in this single piece of story content. Considering Arkham Knight is fairly stingy in the challenge map department, that’s another big missed opportunity." [...] Reiner felt the pack would only be of value to players who enjoy the Arkham story, stating, [...] "Developer WB Montreal can <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> creating a wonderfully realized version of Batgirl, who is resourceful and capable of striking fear into Joker's henchmen, but the mission she embarks on lacks creativity and ranks among the Arkham series' worst." [...] He did, however, praise the side story involving Edward Burke, the person who built the amusement park where the story takes place, calling it [...] "twisted and dark" [...] and shedding [...] "new light {{on one of the}} series' mainstays." ...|$|E

[...] and called 1Nenokkadine a [...] "visually stunning" [...] film. Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3.5out of five stars: [...] "As the film tries out a refined or reformed revenge saga, {{it needs to be}} seen whether 1 Nenokkadine works at the box office. If it does, it is a good sign for Telugu cinema". A. S. Sashidhar of The Times of India wrote, [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is good and will keep you wanting for more. The story has a few interesting twists and turns, in the second half too to keep the audience glued to the screen", and Sukumar [...] "should <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> superb attempt in choosing to make a film that has not been explored in Telugu movies". Shekhar of Oneindia called the film a [...] "brilliant psychological thriller": [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is excellent and will impress all classes of audience. A few sentimental scenes slow down the pace of narration in the second half. But the superb climax that lasts for 15 minutes will compensate it. The viewers will surely walk out of theatre with contented hearts".|$|E
500|$|Belle helped {{establish}} Woolverton as a [...] "legendary screenwriter"; the writer continues to <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> her dedication to creating strong female characters; ever since Belle, {{the majority of}} Woolverton's female characters have been headstrong, independent women, namely Nala in The Lion King (1994), Mulan in Mulan (1998), Alice in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Maleficent in Maleficent (2014). Susan Wloszczyna of Indiewire wrote that [...] "Woolverton set a new standard for fully fleshed-out fairy-tale heroines ... with Belle", in turn {{paving the way for}} The Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen, and Frozens Anna and Elsa (2013). Woolverton remains protective of Belle, explaining, [...] " [...] was my first-born child, so there’s a little bit of possessiveness, which really I had to let it go". Beauty and the Beast, Belle performs the film's opening number, [...] "Belle", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992. In 1998, O'Hara was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Feature Production for reprising her role as Belle in the second of Beauty and the Beasts three direct-to-video sequels, Belle's Magical World. To commemorate her work on Beauty and the Beast and various contributions to Disney, O'Hara was honored with a Disney Legends award on August 19, 2011. Disney hired Spanish actress Penélope Cruz to pose as Belle in photographer Annie Leibovitz's Disney Dream Portrait Series, while actor Jeff Bridges posed as the Beast.

500|$|IGN's Matt Fowler {{wrote in}} his review, [...] "At this point, {{it seems like the}} pattern {{when it comes to the}} ninth episode of a given season of Game of Thrones is tragic death, amazing battle, tragic death, amazing battle, and so on. And this being Season 6, it was time to land on a phenomenal clash of swords and shields - and 'Battle of the Bastards' {{certainly}} delivered." [...] He continued, [...] "Game of Thrones did not disappoint when it came to this season's great northern battle, as Jon and Sansa's differences were spectacularly highlighted in a savagely strong war chapter that saw House Stark overcome huge odds to reclaim their home. Plus, Daenerys got to soar, as her dragons quickly stopped a violent siege with fury and fire." [...] Fowler gave the episode a top score of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the episode: [...] "As directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who also oversaw last season's terrific 'Hardhome' episode, the lengthy sequence was terrifying, gripping and exhilarating, sometimes all at once, a sweeping display of all the different ways one can die on the battlefield." [...] Egner called Ramsay's death an episode highlight ("Ramsay Bolton's demise was arguably the most eagerly anticipated death ever on Game of Thrones and the show handled it with flair, dispatching him in a poetic, canine-fueled fashion that was no less satisfying for being telegraphed early on"), and concluded about Daenerys's scene: [...] "Daenerys Stormborn had a few words for the slave masters who launched their attack last week. Those words included 'surrender or die' and 'thanks for the ships', as we saw another thrilling action sequence that I believe reunited the dragon triplets for the first time since they were quite young." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "This battle works as a climactic moment for Game of Thrones as a cultural event, selling us on the scale and ambition of the producers and their production teams, all who should <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> the accomplishments from a technical perspective." [...] According to James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Was this the show's best episode? It's hard to immediately process that question. Maybe? Probably. It's almost certainly the most exciting hour and had the most jaw-dropping battle sequence we've seen yet on TV." ...|$|E

2500|$|Origen of Alexandria (c. 240), as {{quoted by}} Eusebius (c. 330) {{had this to}} say on the matter: [...] "That the {{character}} of the diction of the epistle entitled To the Hebrews has not the apostle’s rudeness in speech, who confessed himself rude in speech, that is, in style, but that the epistle is better Greek in the framing of its diction, will be admitted by everyone who is able to discern differences of style. But again, on the other hand, that the thoughts of the epistle are admirable, and not inferior to the acknowledged writings of the apostle, to this also everyone will consent as true who has given attention to reading the apostle…. But as for myself, if I were to state my own opinion, I should say that the thoughts are the apostle’s, but that the style and composition belonged to one who called to mind the apostle’s teachings and, as it were, made short notes of what his master said. If any church, therefore, holds this epistle as Paul’s, let it <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> this also. For not without reason have the men of old handed it down as Paul’s. But who wrote the epistle, in truth God knows. Yet the account which has reached us , some saying that Clement, who was bishop of the Romans, wrote the epistle, others, that it was Luke, he who wrote the Gospel and the Acts." ...|$|E

Bartak later recalled the [...] " [...] displayed all the main features of autism when I met her, including one she wouldn't have known about... The {{fact that she was}} apparently sociable and interacting with people doesn't mean she didn't have some type of disorder". Bartak helped Williams [...] "begin building bridges instead of walls between worlds". In July 1996, doubts about Williams' condition were aired on Radio National's The Health Report and by The Australian newspaper. The claims of [...] "faking it" [...] were denied by both Williams and Bartak. In February 2005, David Smukler, writing in the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities' journal Mental Retardation, noted that back in the mid-1990s some sceptics had a poorly defined understanding of the autism spectrum: [...] "...autistic people such as Donna Williams and Temple Grandin started to publish first-person accounts that described their lives as autistic people living in an often-inhospitable nonautistic world. Many readers of these early accounts questioned whether or not the authors were really autistic. The assumption underlying such responses is that autism is so incapacitating that Williams or Grandin could not be autistic and still write with such insight and sensitivity. When their books first appeared, autistic authors were characterized either as frauds or exceptions". Smukler concluded: [...] "Today, Williams' and Grandin's 'credentials' are rarely challenged. Rather than being doubted, {{they are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> offering us an 'inside out' view of autism".|$|E
