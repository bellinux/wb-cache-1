About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow the}} entire length of the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The {{original}} alignment of Route 3 became Route 153. Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway Department had deemed it too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of present-day}} MD 331 was {{designated}} {{as part of}} US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established. By 1940, US 213 was {{moved to a new}} alignment that crossed the Choptank River at Cambridge on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton. Both ends of MD 331 have been shortened since, with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the {{southern}} terminus of US 213 was cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 50 in Wye Mills, {{with the former}} route between Wye Mills and Ocean City becoming an extension of US 50 from Annapolis over the newly completed Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The former routing of US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City is now US 50 between Wye Mills and Vienna, Old Route 50 through Vienna, US 50 between Vienna and Salisbury, US 50 Bus. through Salisbury, MD 346 between Salisbury and east of Berlin, and US 50 between east of Berlin and Ocean City. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved {{the elimination of the}} US 213 designation. US 213 along with MD 280 were replaced by MD 213, which ran from MD 662 in Wye Mills north to the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill. In 1994, the at-grade intersection with US 301 was replaced with an interchange.|$|E
5|$|That night Jones and {{the eight}} men with him {{stayed in the}} ravine just under the crest. Without his radio he could not {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the company which he thought had been destroyed or driven off the hill.

Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> lines, but North Koreans captured Jones and the eight men with him near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. This account of the 3rd Platoon explains why, except for the 3d Squad which rejoined D Company that evening, it was out of the action and off the crest almost as soon as it arrived on top, unknown to Kennedy and the rest of the company at the time.|$|E

5|$|The route was {{initially}} designated as US 213 in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was established, running from Ocean City west and north to US 40 in Elkton. The highway was rerouted {{to cross the}} Nanticoke River in Vienna by 1933, with the former route between Mardela Springs and Eldorado becoming a part of MD 313 and the alignment between Eldorado and Rhodesdale becoming part of MD 14. US 213 was rerouted to use the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge over the Choptank River in Cambridge in 1939; the former alignment between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. Meanwhile, the road between Elkton and the Pennsylvania border became MD 280. US 213 was moved to a bypass of Easton and straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills in 1948. A year later, the southern terminus was cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 50 in Wye Mills, with an extended US 50 replacing US 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City.

In 1937, the current alignment south of Waynesboro became a southern extension of PA 997 while PA 316 was extended north from Chambersburg to PA 944 south of Upper Strasburg. In the 1940s, the route swapped alignments with PA 997 south of Waynesboro while {{the north end}} was cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 11 in Chambersburg, {{with most of the}} former alignment north of Chambersburg removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot.|$|E

There were cancelled proposals in the 1930s to build a parkway along the corridor between Morrisville and New Hope and for a freeway in the 1960s between Interstate 95 (I-95) in Yardley and US 202 in New Hope. PA 32 was extended to its current southern terminus in the 1980s, replacing a part of US 1 Alternate (US 1 Alt.). Parts of the road were rebuilt in the 2000s due to floods.|$|E

25|$|When Pennsylvania first legislated {{routes in}} 1911, {{what is now}} PA 32 was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 252 between Morrisville and Yardley. PA 32 was designated in 1927 to run between Philadelphia and US 611/PA 2 in Kintnersville, heading northeast along US 13 to Morrisville before turning northwest on its present alignment. At this time, the entire route was paved. In 1928, the southern terminus was cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 1 (Bridge Street) in Morrisville, removing the concurrency with US 13. In 1932, a parkway was proposed along the route from Morrisville to New Hope; however, it was never built. In 1969, another proposal was created for a $30million PA 32 freeway from I-95 near Yardley to US 202 in New Hope. At the time, this freeway was {{to be completed by}} 1985. However, the proposal never came about. In the 1980s, PA 32 was extended southwest to its current terminus, replacing a part of US 1 Alt., which had replaced the earlier US 1 designation, on Bridge Street.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, US 6 was realigned to the Scranton-Carbondale Highway (now US 6 Bus.); {{however, the}} {{southern}} terminus of PA 347 remained at Main Street in Dickson City. The {{south end of}} PA 347 was cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 6 by 1960. In April 1961, the northern terminus of PA 347 was truncated to PA 632, with PA 524 replacing the route between PA 407 and the current northern terminus and the section between PA 632 and PA 524 becoming unnumbered. This change was made {{as part of the}} construction of I-81 (the Penn-Can Highway). In the 1960s, PA 347 was realigned and extended south along its present alignment to US 11/PA 307 at the intersection of Blakely and Green Ridge streets in Dunmore. US 11/PA 307 was removed from the southern terminus of PA 347 in the 1980s, leaving the route terminating at an unnumbered road. The southern terminus of PA 347 was cut back to SR 2020 at the intersection of Drinker and Blakely streets by 1990. In addition, the route was extended north along its former alignment from PA 632 to PA 524.|$|E
