5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E

Nu metal hairstyles and facial hairstyles include dreadlocks, spiky hair, chin beards, bald heads, goatees, frosted tips, and bleached or dyed hair. Common accessories in nu metal fashion include wallet chains, tattoos, and piercings, especially facial piercings. Nu metal fashion {{has been compared}} to hip hop fashion.|$|E
25|$|Before {{starting}} {{his professional life}} in entertainment, he explored {{a number of possible}} careers, such as medicine and professional boxing, before joining the entertainment world as a dancer. By 1930 he was involved in Mexico City's carpa (travelling tent) circuit, performing in succession with the Ofelia, Sotelo of Azcapotzalco, and finally the Valentina carpa, where he met his future wife. At first he tried to imitate Al Jolson by smearing his face with black paint, but later separated himself to form his own identity as an impoverished slum dweller with <b>baggy</b> <b>pants,</b> a rope for a belt, and a distinctive mustache. In the tents, he danced, performed acrobatics, and performed roles related to several different professions.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, Australia, East Germany, and America, the skater {{subculture}} {{reached the}} height of popularity in the mid 80s. Unlike the hippie and surfer influenced skaters of the 70s, the skaters of the 80s overwhelmingly preferred sportswear and punk fashion, especially baseball caps, red waffle plaid shirts, sleeveless T-shirts, <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> or Jams shorts resembling pajamas, checkered wristbands, striped tube socks, and basketball shoes like Converse All Stars and Vans. Brightly colored T-shirts became fashionable {{by the end of}} the decade, often featuring psychedelic eyes, skulls, Ed Roth inspired cartoon characters, palm trees, iron crosses, or the logos of skateboard brands like Stussy, Tony Hawk, Mooks or Santa Cruz. The longer surfer hair was replaced with edgy hardcore punk and street punk inspired styles like the bowl cut or Hitler Youth haircut.|$|E
25|$|The Prince was {{originally}} created by Mechner as {{the protagonist of}} his new game. His inspiration for the character's athleticism was the opening ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, referencing main character Indiana Jones' approach to situations encountered. Indiana Jones' less impervious portrayal compared to other action heroes also influenced Mechner's portrayal of the Prince. The character was based on multiple similar figures in ancient literature, including One Thousand and One Nights. The character's movements were created using rotoscoping, with Mechner video taping his brother doing the movements, then mapping them into the game. Originally a plain figure in white clothing, the Prince was restyled for its Japanese release in a turban and <b>baggy</b> <b>pants.</b> This look pleased Mechner, and became associated with the character during the original trilogy. Speaking in 2010, Mechner said that during his time writing the series bible {{for the production of}} future Prince of Persia games, he was attempting to force the character into the conventions of western fiction, forgetting the character's literary origins. By the time Prince of Persia 3D released to a lukewarm response, Mechner was actually pleased that the Prince had run his course, as he no longer recognized the character.|$|E
25|$|In Los Angeles, {{clothing}} {{is an important}} marker for Filipino street gangs and gang members. After 1965, Los Angeles {{became one of the}} largest cities of Filipino immigrants which saw a massive migration of Filipino youth. To combat Mexican gang members, Filipino gangs arose. The Satana gang fused styles of the Philippines with those of other fashions, particularly cholo fashion among the Latino neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Satana members used the cholo style of dress as inspiration, as well as the jefrox style popularized in Manila. The jefrox style was typically associated with counterculture elements such as long hair and Rock and roll music. The hybrid of both jefrox and cholo styles resulted in brushed hair, the use of nets and bandanas, open toed sandals, and loose fitting shirts. Some Satana members preferred wearing khakis with significant creases as an homage to the Manong generation of the 1920’s and 1930’s. These khakis were deliberately worn to showcase the unity that the younger generations had with the Filipino laborers of the 1930’s who originally came to California. By the eighties and nineties, Filipino gang members quickly adopted the cholo style of Latino youth. Satana gang members wore loose fitting, <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> that were fully black in conjunction with white t-shirts and pendletons. Styles of dress varied, however, even among gangs. The Satana homeboys of the mid-Wilshire and Temple areas of Los Angeles were Filipinos from all economic backgrounds, from lower class to upper class families. Members from a wealthier background were easily identifiable, as they wore luxury clothes reminiscent of the “Manong” generation. Overall, men and women sought to wear brand name clothing such as Tommy Hilfiger and Nautica, who had significant presence in the hip-hop fashion community in the nineties. Filipino men chose to wore ill-fitting clothes while Filipina women chose to wear more revealing clothing. Items such as clothing played a role in how Filipino youth identified themselves, especially in inner city areas.|$|E
500|$|Daredevil's costume {{was also}} {{upgraded}} in the season, with Calvert calling it [...] "a much more fluid suit {{and much more}} tactical in a way." [...] The costume department [...] "streamlined" [...] the suit to make it simpler, using less material on the gauntlets and boots. Cox {{described it as a}} [...] "delicate area" [...] that required some [...] "tweaks" [...] after the brief use of it {{at the end of the}} first season. He noted that the changes are weaved into the storyline of the season, including the need for a new, redesigned mask, and a lower-half of the suit that is closer to the original cargo pants that the character wore earlier in the previous season. These <b>baggier</b> <b>pants</b> gave Cox and his stunt double much more maneuverability.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Mars singing while playing an upright piano. Eminem, who is laying {{on a couch}} in an untidy living room while wearing a white T-shirt and red <b>baggy</b> <b>pants,</b> {{subsequently}} picks up a notepad with lyrics and begins to rap his verse. He discovers a trap door {{on the floor and}} climbs down a ladder, and then finds himself in an underground tunnel with pipes, while red highway flares illuminate the setting. He lights a flare to navigates through a series of tunnels. While Mars sings the chorus once again in the same setting as shown in the beginning, Eminem continues to search through the tunnels.|$|E
500|$|The {{infantry}} commander was Lieutenant Colonel Freeman E. Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry {{was also}} known as [...] "Piatt's Zouaves" [...] or the [...] "1st Ohio Zouaves", and typically served as a mounted infantry, including in this expedition. As mounted infantry, Piatt's Zouaves used horses for transportation, but (unlike cavalry) fought dismounted. Their infantry weapons were heavier and had longer range than the light weapons used by cavalry. Colonel Abram S. Piatt, who retired in 1862 after injuries, was their original commander. [...] Piatt's Zouaves wore distinctive caps and uniforms trimmed in red, but did not always have the Asian-style <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> with open jackets typical of zouave units. Regiments that dressed as zouaves during the Civil War were copying the look (and hopefully the discipline) of elite French troops that fought successfully during the 1850s in northern Africa.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Louisiana, USA State Representative Derrick Shepherd {{proposed}} a bill (HB1626), {{also known as}} the <b>Baggy</b> <b>Pants</b> Bill to Louisiana House of Representatives. The bill proposed that [...] "it shall be unlawful for any person to appear in public wearing his pants below his waist and thereby exposing his skin or intimate clothing" [...] and that violators would be subjected to three eight-hour days of community service and a fine of up to US$175. The measure died in the face of opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union. The bill was {{proposed a}}gain in 2008 and was rejected by a state Senate panel. In two Louisiana towns, Delcambre (a maximum penalty of US$615 fine or up to six months in prison) and Opelousas (a maximum penalty of US$500 fine or up to six months in prison), wearing low slung pants that reveal buttock cleavage or undergarments is considered a misdemeanor. Garments that reveal underpants were banned in four other Louisiana towns including Alexandria and Shreveport, where violators face fines of US$150 or 15 days in jail, as well as Hawkinsville, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Lindsay Zoladz, {{a writer}} of Pitchfork, {{observed}} when {{most people think of}} TLC, their brains immediately go to the sounds and images of CrazySexyCool: [...] "Waterfalls", [...] "Red Light Special" [...] and the silk pajamas in [...] "Creep". Ebony Michael A. Gonzales reminisced about the time when the video first debuted on MTV, TLC returned as the [...] "lipstick liberators," [...] much to the surprise of a public used to their tomboy style. The journalist then also compared the [...] "splashy" [...] video to its previous versions as [...] "less urban" [...] and more [...] "Madison Avenue commercial chic." [...] Like Gonzales, PopMatters writer Quentin B.

In the book Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context, author Carol Vernallis analyzed that the girls' outfits in [...] "Creep" [...] helped suggesting their [...] "sexual availability," [...] but the low-angle camera placement, the texture and movement of billowing silk fabric suggest a [...] "phallic sexuality." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the cover}} of the album, Queen appears in a [...] "low-cut, cleavage-showing little black dress", and is seen wearing various gold bracelets that cover her right eye. Similar to the cover for Real, the look sported by Queen is more sexually provocative. [...] The change in image for Queen is {{attributed}} to Universal Latino feeling that the album Real had crossover potential to U.S. mainstream audiences. This is also attributed to Queen responding to the criticism she has received in the past for looking like a tomboy, wearing <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> and larger shirts, from the Puerto Rican press, middle class and members of the older generation, a subject Queen addresses in her autobiography, Detrás Del Glamour (Behind Glamour). However, Queen took responsibility for this change in image, which she attributed to a [...] "new growth in person". She confessed the makeover stemmed from a [...] "crisis" [...] and [...] "female vanity". Seeking to recontour her figure, Queen enlisted the help of a Colombian plastic surgeon. Her breast were augmented in July 2004, during a promotional tour of the country. The album cover also features Queen's signature long nails which she sports in a variety of colors; in this case they are light blue and white.|$|E
5000|$|The song makes {{references}} to a [...] "Shawty" [...] {{in a club}} who is wearing Apple Bottom jeans and boots with fur. [...] "Shawty" [...] also wears <b>baggy</b> sweat <b>pants</b> and Reeboks with the straps.

In particular, the song describes one of her more memorable dance sequences as giving her buttocks (colloquially {{referred to as a}} booty) a smack prior to [...] "getting low".|$|R
5000|$|Lalo Guerrero {{became known}} as the father of Chicano music, as the young people adopted a music, language, and dress of their own. Young men wore zoot suits—a {{flamboyant}} long jacket with <b>baggy</b> pegged <b>pants,</b> sometimes accessorized with a pork pie hat, a long watch chain, and shoes with thick soles. They called themselves [...] "pachucos." [...] In the early 1940s, arrests of Mexican-American youths and negative stories in the Los Angeles Times fueled a perception that these pachuco gangs were delinquents who were a threat to the broader community.|$|R

500|$|Unlike Queen's {{previous}} albums, {{the artwork}} for Real features provocative photography; her middle and thighs are emphasized {{to create a}} sexy image. Queen said her breasts were enlarged from a B to a C cup, adding that the packaging described the style of music on the album. The album cover also features Queen's signature long nails, which she sports {{in a variety of}} colors. Incorporating graffiti, the album has [...] "street cred" [...] in the U.S.-centered hip-hop world. The change in image for Queen is attributed to Universal Latino's feeling that Real had crossover potential for U.S. mainstream audiences. The album's title suggests this; it means [...] "real" [...] in English and Spanish and [...] "royal" [...] in Spanish, hinting at Queen's status as the Queen of Reggaetón. It is also Queen's response to Puerto Rican criticism for looking like a tomboy, wearing <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> and large shirts (which she addresses in her autobiography, Detrás Del Glamour [...] ). She accepted responsibility for her change in image, attributing it to a [...] "new growth in person" [...] and admitting that the makeover stemmed from a [...] "crisis" [...] and [...] "female vanity".

500|$|Establishing the characters' {{background}} {{rather than}} prettiness {{was the main}} goal of costumes. Ben wore the same clothes in both seasons, and {{to make them look}} identical, around twenty multiples of his coveralls were made by hand. It took over six weeks to apply all stitches, patches and the roughly fifty holes, plus the aging process. Brother Justin's clothes were made period-correct from the beginning, but the character's foreboding presence was enhanced by fitting his frock on the waist and making the shoulders look bigger than usual for that time period. Sofie's clothes had a strong Bohemian Eastern influence to portray her mother's origin and sensibilities. Stumpy's wardrobe consisted of <b>baggy</b> <b>pants</b> and an Italian bowler hat that gave him a 1920s look instead of the 1930s, showing his clothes were second-hand. The stripper clothes of Rita Sue and Libby were influenced by Mae West, harlot movies and silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, with additional research put into Asian harlots, Latin dancers and Hawaiian dancers. The costume designers chose the costumes of the Daily Brothers Show, a rival carnival, to have a new color tone to set them apart from the Carnivàle. The dress of Sabina the Scorpion Lady underwent several die-bleaching cycles to achieve a red-orange-purple color that would work well when filming outside. Bert/Bertha's costume was made in a hurry from a vintage tuxedo and an old feathered dress, which helped to give it a [...] "made-it-on-the-road" [...] feeling.|$|E

5000|$|Teenagers {{developed}} their own music, language and dress. For the men, the style was to wear a zoot suit — a flamboyant long coat with <b>baggy</b> pegged <b>pants,</b> a pork pie hat, a long key chain and shoes with thick soles. They called themselves [...] "Pachucos." [...] Trouble broke out in Los Angeles and several smaller cities, where servicemen in uniform who {{had never seen a}} Mexican American took umbrage at well-paid teenagers taking their leisure. Skirmishes and mini riots erupted in 1943, but the servicemen moved out, no one was killed, and there were few long-term reverberations.|$|R
50|$|Harem pants or harem {{trousers}} are <b>baggy,</b> long <b>pants</b> {{caught in}} at the ankle. Early on, the style was also called a harem skirt. The original so-called 'harem pants/skirts' were introduced to Western fashion by Paul Poiret around 1910, although they themselves were inspired by Middle East styles, and by şalvar (Turkish trousers). The term 'harem pants' subsequently became popular in the West as a generic term for baggy trousers caught {{in at the}} ankle that suggest the Turkish style, or similar styles such as bloomers, the South Asian shalwar and patiala salwar; the Bosnian dimije; sirwal (as worn by Zouaves); and the Ukrainian sharovary.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, a law {{was created}} {{so that the}} inmates were no longer {{required}} to wear stripes. Inmates would wear <b>baggy</b> denim <b>pants</b> and jackets, cloth hats, and cotton shirts. They also would have numbers stenciled on their backs. Although this was passed, the ball and chain would still be used as punishment for prison offenders until 1940. In the 1940s, the prison began {{to get rid of}} all of the convicts under age eighteen. Most of them were sent to the reformatory.The main issue with the Kentucky State Penitentiary in this period was the correctional officer force, always low in numbers and low-paid.|$|R
