25|$|The Copenhagen Frequency Plan of 1948 {{resulted}} in Norway only being allocated one medium wave and one long wave frequency. The audio quality diminished as Norwegian transmitters {{were forced to}} share frequencies with foreign channels. This could be overcome by installing a network of FM <b>broadcasting</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The Telegraphy Administration rejected FM, stating that this would require the entire country to buy new radios. A 1949 plan proposed a new long wave transmitter at Kløfta and a national network of medium wave transmitters. NRK accepted the transmitter at Kløfta, but rejected the medium wave transmitters. As {{twenty percent of the}} population lacked acceptable radio coverage, NRK decided in 1953 to build FM transmitters in Western Norway and Agder to reach these areas. An advantage of building FM transmitters was that they could be co-located with television transmitters, reducing the roll-out costs.|$|E

5000|$|Selectivity is {{the ability}} to [...] "tune in" [...] to just one station of the many that may be {{transmitting}} at any given time. An adjustable bandpass filter is a typical stage of a receiver. A receiver may include several stages of bandpass filters to provide sufficient selectivity. Additionally, the receiver design must provide immunity from spurious signals that may be generated within the receiver that would interfere with the desired signal. <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>transmitters</b> in any given area are assigned frequencies so that receivers can properly select the desired transmission; this is a key factor limiting the number of transmitting stations that can operate in a given area.|$|E
50|$|The Kenadsa longwave {{transmitter}} is a longwave transmitter of the Algerian Broadcasting Company {{situated at}} Kénadsa near Béchar, which transmits {{the program of}} Chaine 1 with a power of 2000 kW on 153 kHz. Kenadsa longwave transmitter, among the most powerful <b>broadcasting</b> <b>transmitters</b> in the world, uses an antenna array of three 357-meter tall guyed masts, which are arranged in a line. In spite of its high power, and unlike the Tipaza Longwave Transmitter, Kenadsa broadcasts are difficult to receive in Europe. This occurs because its frequency is also used by powerful European broadcasting stations {{and as a result}} of signal attenuation caused by poor ground conductivity of the Sahara sand. It is currently the tallest structure in Algeria. Currently this transmitter is off.|$|E
