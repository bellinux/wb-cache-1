5|$|From 1933 the Knights became regular {{visitors}} to Malvern, Worcestershire, making an annual {{visit to the}} Malvern Festival, which had been established by their friend Barry Jackson. During one such visit Knight met George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> and painted his portrait. A blue plaque at the Mount Pleasant Hotel on Belle Vue Terrace, Great Malvern, commemorates the time the Knights spent in the area. They found much inspiration for their work in the Malvern Hills and in the surrounding countryside and {{by the start of}} World War Two the couple were living at Colwall in Herefordshire.|$|E

He played Sir Sydney Cockerell, {{director}} of the Fitzwilliam Museum, in a representation of a friendship between Cockerell, <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> and Laurentia McLachlan, a Benedictine nun. Gielgud had some trouble learning his lines; at one performance he almost forgot them, momentarily distracted by seeing in a 1938 copy of The Times, read by his character, a review of his own portrayal of Vershinin in Three Sisters fifty years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Mark Millar is a Coatbridge {{comic book}} writer whose Wanted comic book series has been {{translated}} into a feature film starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman, {{as well as the}} highly successful graphic novel Kickass which was adapted into the successful film of the same name in 2010.

5|$|About halfway along Euston Road, at the {{junction}} with Upper Woburn Place, is St Pancras New Church, built in 1822. Designed by William and Henry Inwood and costing around £90,000 (now £), {{it was the most}} expensive religious building in London since St Paul's Cathedral, completed in the previous century. Almost opposite is Euston Road fire station, built 1901–2, in an Arts and Crafts style by Percy Nobbs. The Shaw Theatre opened at No.100–110 in 1971, in honour of George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw.</b> It was refurbished in 2000 as part of an adjacent Novotel development. The Keith Grant sculpture at the theatre's front was removed but was subsequently reinstated after protests.|$|E

5|$|After her {{drama school}} education, Leigh {{appeared}} in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed {{to the role}} of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} {{production}} of Hamlet starring Sir Frank Benson, Richardson decided to become an actor and made his stage debut, playing a gendarme in The Bishop's Candlesticks in December 1920. After touring and appearing in rep, he made his London debut in July 1926 as the stranger in Oedipus at Colonus. In 1930 he joined the Old Vic where he first met Gielgud, staying with the company until the following year. After service during the Second World War with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, he returned to acting, preferring {{the works of the}} more modern authors Luigi Pirandello, Joe Orton, Harold Pinter, George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> and J. B. Priestley to the classic plays of Shakespeare. A radio career ran in parallel to that on the stage, and Richardson was first broadcast in The City in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Bondfield's brother Frank had {{established}} himself in London some years earlier as a printer and trades unionist, and in 1894, having saved £5, {{she decided to}} join him. She found London shopworking conditions no better than in Brighton, but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became {{an active member of}} the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings. Her political and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw,</b> and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP).|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor {{condition}} it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal {{to raise money}} for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, the Arts and Crafts movement master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work left in place and strengthened earlier structures where possible but added new aspects including a stone buttress and a kitchen range.|$|E
5|$|Morris aided the DF {{using his}} artistic and {{literary}} talents; he designed the group's membership card, and helped author their manifesto, Socialism Made Plain, {{in which they}} demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, an eight-hour working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his socialist values with his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired as a man of integrity. The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, Justice, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|On stage, Fox {{appeared}} in Mrs. Warren's Profession by George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> at the Strand Theatre (now the Novello Theatre) in London in 2002, and John Ford's 17th-century play 'Tis Pity She's a Whore in 2005. Between 2006 and 2007 he starred in Treats by Christopher Hampton with his future wife, Billie Piper. In April 2007, Fox lost his temper with a paparazzi photographer outside the Garrick Theatre in London {{where he was}} performing in Treats and was arrested for assault. He was later released after receiving a police caution. Newspaper reports stated that the caution would remain on his record {{for three years and}} might prevent his obtaining a visa to perform in the US. In 2013, Fox played Guy Haines in Strangers on a Train at London's Gielgud Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Shaw wrote Take a Life, {{his first}} play, in 1961. He {{directed}} {{a production of}} the show at London's Mermaid Theatre, where he also played the lead role of the Detective. That same year he played two lead roles in George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> plays at the Dublin Theatre Festival: Mrs. Warren's Profession and Candida. Around this time, he also wrote an outline for a television comedy series about four girls sharing a flat, inspired by his real-life daughter, who was in her early twenties {{and living in a}} flat with other girls her age. The series was submitted to the Granada Television company, which expressed interest in the show and said it was one of two under consideration for television. The company ultimately chose the other show, the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|Written by Basil Dawson, this four-part story {{involving}} {{murders in}} Victorian London. Dawson, a veteran screenwriter, {{was approached by}} script editor Robert Holmes to develop a story which would introduce a new companion to replace Sarah Jane Smith following her departure. The new character {{was to be a}} Cockney girl whom the Doctor would take under his wing and educate, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle in the George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> play Pygmalion. This story was planned to be the fourth story of Season 14. The Gaslight Murders was quickly abandoned, however. Its spot in the schedule was ultimately filled by The Face of Evil, while Holmes reused the general framework in The Talons of Weng-Chiang.|$|E
5|$|Her Majesty's Theatre is a West End theatre {{situated}} on Haymarket in the City of Westminster, London. The present building {{was designed by}} Charles J. Phipps and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the theatre. In {{the early decades of}} the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw,</b> J. M. Synge, Noël Coward and J. B. Priestley. Since the First World War, the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has specialised in hosting musicals. The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.|$|E

5|$|Malvern Theatres, {{housed in}} the Winter Gardens complex in the town centre, is a provincial centre for the arts. The first Malvern Drama Festival, {{which took place in}} 1929, was {{dedicated}} to <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw</b> and planned by Sir Barry Jackson. A number of works have had their first performances at Malvern, six by Shaw including In Good King Charles's Golden Days, the 1929 English première of The Apple Cart, and the world première of Geneva in 1938. In 1956 Malvern held a Shaw centenary week. In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and extensive refurbishment was undertaken. J B Priestley presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998, a further £7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (1876) is an epic poem of over 10,000 lines by William Morris {{that tells}} the tragic story, drawn from the Volsunga Saga and the Elder Edda, of the Norse hero Sigmund, his son Sigurd (the {{equivalent}} of Siegfried in the Nibelungenlied and Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung) and Sigurd's wife Gudrun. It sprang from a fascination with the Volsung legend that extended back twenty years to the author's youth, and had already resulted in several other literary and scholarly treatments of the story. It was Morris's own favorite of his poems, and was enthusiastically praised both by contemporary critics and by such figures as T. E. Lawrence and George <b>Bernard</b> <b>Shaw.</b> In recent years it has been rated very highly by many William Morris scholars, but has never succeeded in finding a wide readership on account of its great length and archaic diction. It {{has been seen as}} an influence on such fantasy writers as Andrew Lang and J. R. R. Tolkien. The Story of Sigurd is available in modern reprints, both in its original form and in a cut-down version, but there is no critical edition.|$|E
