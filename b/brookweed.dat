50|$|Cornwall {{is home to}} many rare flower species, {{especially}} {{at the southern end}} of the Lizard, due to its unique soil and geology. On the Lizard Peninsula, Cornish heath - the floral emblem of Cornwall - mesembryanthemums, butcher's broom, early meadow grass and a wide range of clovers including the Lizard clover, <b>brookweed</b> and yellow wallpepper can be found. The north coast of Cornwall features maritime grassland, heathland and stunted woodland.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of beach and associated coastal vegetation along 17 km of coastline. One {{of its two}} prominent plant communities is a dense coastal dune shrubland composed of medium shrubs, such as coast wattle and coast beard-heath, above a ground cover of grasses, herbs and sedges. The other is a mosaic of aquatic herbland, coastal saltmarsh and damp saline pasture, composed of species such as beaded glasswort, creeping <b>brookweed,</b> shiny swamp-mat, buck's-horn plantain and fat-hen.|$|E
50|$|Samolus (known as <b>brookweed,</b> {{or water}} pimpernel) {{is a widely}} {{distributed}} genus {{of about a dozen}} species of water-loving herbs. According to the APG III classification, this genus belongs to the Primulaceae family in the order Ericales. It was considered as closely related to a clade comprising the Theophrastaceae, and was treated as part of that family or in its own monogeneric family, the Samolaceae. The APG III system does not recognize these families and instead includes all species formerly belonging to Theophrastaceae in the Primulaceae family.|$|E
5000|$|Menawethan (Men an Wedhen, {{the tree}} stone) (...) , is a steep-sided island to the {{south-east}} {{of the group}} with vegetation that is typical of islands with breeding seabirds. It {{was one of the}} first islands where Natural England carried out rat eradication. Some areas are covered in hottentot fig (probably carried to the island by gulls); thrift and sea campion also dominate in some areas. Other species recorded include Yorkshire fog, orache, common scurvy-grass and tree-mallow which forms temporary stands in some years. <b>Brookweed</b> (Samolus valerandi), a plant restricted to cliff flushes in Cornwall and an unusual plant in Scilly, grows among rocks above the shore. The rocky shore is used by grey seal for haul outs. There is a Bronze Age cairn on the summit. The island is recorded as Mynangwython c1588.|$|E
