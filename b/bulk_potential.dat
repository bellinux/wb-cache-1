40|$|We {{define a}} {{continuum}} energy functional {{in terms of}} the meanfield Maier-Saupe free energy, that describes both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. The Maier-Saupe theory defines the main macroscopic variable, the Q-tensor order parameter, {{in terms of the}} second moment of a probability distribution function. This definition requires the eigenvalues of Q to be bounded both from below and above. We define a thermotropic <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> which blows up whenever the eigenvalues tend to these lower and upper bounds. This is in contrast to the Landau-de Gennes theory which has no such penalization. We study the asymptotics of this <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> in different regimes and discuss phase transitions predicted by this model. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{define a}} {{continuum}} energy functional that effectively interpolates between the mean-field Maier-Saupe {{energy and the}} continuum Landau-de Gennes energy functional and can describe both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. In the mean-field approach the main macroscopic variable, the Q-tensor order parameter, is {{defined in terms of}} the second moment of a probability distribution function. This definition imposes certain constraints on the eigenvalues of the Q-tensor order parameter, which may be interpreted as physical constraints. We define a thermotropic <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> which blows up whenever the eigenvalues of the Q-tensor order parameter approach physically unrealistic values. As a consequence, the minimizers of this continuum energy functional have physically realistic order parameters in all temperature regimes. We study the asymptotics of this <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> and show that this model also predicts a first-order nematic-isotropic phase transition, whilst respecting the physical constraints. In contrast, in the Landau-de Gennes framework the Q-tensor order parameter is often defined independently of the probability distribution function, and the theory makes physically unrealistic predictions about the equilibrium order parameters in the low-temperature regime.

40|$|Recently quintessence is {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} observation data of supernova indicating a time-varying cosmological constant and accelerating universe. Inspired by this and its mysterious origin, we look {{for the possibility of}} quintessence as the holographic dark matters dominated in the late time in the brane world scenarios. We consider both the cases of static and moving brane in a dilaton gravity background. For the static brane we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method motivated by holographic renormalization group to study the intrinsic FRW cosmology on the brane and find out the constraint on the <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> for the quintessence. This constraint requires a negative slowly varying <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> which implies an anti-de Sitter-like bulk geometry and could be possibly realized from the higher dimensional supergravities or string theory. We find the similar constraint for the moving brane cases and that the quintessence on it has the effect as a mildly time-varying Newton constant.

The variation of the direct current (d. c) electrical conductivity (ionic conductivity), pH and <b>bulk</b> electrical <b>potential</b> of the sample with gamma radiation have been examined in the temperature range of 5 oc to 50 oc. Also the variation of ionic conductivity, pH and <b>bulk</b> electrical <b>potential</b> with temperature was measured for non-irradiated sample and also for irradiated sample at different doses of 30. 20, 80. 60, 110. 90 and 141. 10 mGy respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Both {{galaxies and}} charged {{particle}} beams can exhibit collisionless evolution on surprisingly short time scales. This {{can be attributed}} to the dynamics of chaotic orbits. The chaos is often triggered by resonances caused by time dependence in the <b>bulk</b> <b>potential,</b> which acts almost identically for attractive gravitational forces and repulsive electrostatic forces. The similarity suggests that many physical processes at work in galaxies, while inaccessible to direct controlled experiments, can be tested indirectly via controlled experiments with charged-particle beams such as those envisioned for the University of Maryland Electron Ring currently nearing completion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{three new}} issues that necessarily arise in realistic attempts to apply nonlinear dynamics to galaxy evolution, namely: (i) {{the meaning of}} chaos in many-body systems, (ii) the time-dependence of the <b>bulk</b> <b>potential,</b> which can trigger intervals of transient chaos, and (iii) the self-consistent nature of any bulk chaos, which is generated by the bodies themselves, rather than imposed externally. Simulations and theory both suggest strongly that the physical processes associated with galactic evolution should also act in nonneutral plasmas and charged particle beams. This in turn suggests the possibility of testing this physics in real laboratory experiments, an undertaking currently underway. ...|$|E

The large observed number of mass hierarchy is achieved for the moderate value of this coupling constant of order 0, 3. In the subsequent Paper II it is shown that the same approach in a higher dimensional theory without dilaton permits to express mass hierarchy only through number of extra dimensions. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} discreteness {{effects in}} nearly collisionless N-body systems of charged particles interacting via an unscreened r^- 2 force, allowing for bulk potentials admitting both regular and chaotic orbits. Both for ensembles and individual orbits, as N increases {{there is a}} smooth convergence towards a continuum limit. Discreteness effects are well modeled by Gaussian white noise with relaxation time t_R = const * (N/log L) t_D, with L the Coulomb logarithm and t_D the dynamical time scale. Discreteness effects accelerate emittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for discreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum limit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in time, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently large N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range microchaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic feature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease with increasing N even if the <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> is integrable. Alternatively, {{there is the possibility}} of larger scale macrochaos, characterised by smaller Lyapunov exponents X_S, which is present only if the <b>bulk</b> <b>potential</b> is chaotic. Conventional computations of Lyapunov exponents probe X_N, leading to the oxymoronic conclusion that N-body orbits which look nearly regular and have sharply peaked Fourier spectra are `very chaotic. ' However, the `range' of the microchaos, set by the typical interparticle spacing, decreases as N increases, so that, for large N, this microchaos, albeit very strong, is largely irrelevant macroscopically. A more careful numerical analysis allows one to estimate both X_N and X_S. Comment: 13 pages plus 17 figure...|$|E
