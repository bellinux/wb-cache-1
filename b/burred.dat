50|$|The cutting {{component}} of a card scraper is the <b>burred</b> edge of the scraper. The burr is a sharp hook of metal which is turned {{on the edge of}} the scraper by burnishing with a steel rod. A file or sharpening stone is used to joint the edge of the scraper before burnishing. Cabinet makers typically joint the edge square, or at a right angle to the face of the scraper, which allows a fine burr to be turned on both sides. Luthiers often use a beveled edge, which allows a more aggressive burr, but on one side only.|$|E
40|$|<b>BUR</b> 1 and <b>BUR</b> 2 were {{previously}} identified by a genetic selection for mutations that increase transcription from basal promoters in vivo. <b>BUR</b> 1 encoded a putative protein kinase with greatest similarity {{to members of}} the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family, although that similarity was not sufficient to classify it as a CDK. It was also not known whether <b>Bur</b> 1 activity was cyclin dependent and, if so, which cyclins stimulated <b>Bur</b> 1. The molecular cloning and characterization of <b>BUR</b> 2 presented here sheds light on these issues. Genetic analysis indicates that <b>BUR</b> 2 function is intimately related to that of <b>BUR</b> 1 : <b>bur</b> 1 and <b>bur</b> 2 mutations cause nearly identical spectra of mutant phenotypes, and overexpression of <b>BUR</b> 1 suppresses a <b>bur</b> 2 null allele. Biochemical analysis has provided a molecular basis for these genetic observations. We find that <b>BUR</b> 2 encodes a cyclin for the <b>Bur</b> 1 protein kinase, based on the following evidence. First, the <b>BUR</b> 2 amino acid sequence reveals similarity to the cyclins; second, <b>Bur</b> 1 and <b>Bur</b> 2 coimmunoprecipitate from crude extracts and interact in the two-hybrid system; and third, <b>BUR</b> 2 is required for <b>Bur</b> 1 kinase activity in vitro. Our combined genetic and biochemical results therefore indicate that <b>Bur</b> 1 and <b>Bur</b> 2 comprise a divergent CDK-cyclin complex that has an important functional role during transcription in vivo...|$|R
40|$|<b>BUR</b> 3 and <b>BUR</b> 6 were {{identified}} previously by selecting for mutations that increase transcription from an upstream activating sequence (UAS) -less promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The <b>bur</b> 3 - 1 and <b>bur</b> 6 - 1 mutations are recessive, increase transcription from a suc 2 delta uas allele, and cause other mutant phenotypes, suggesting that <b>Bur</b> 3 p and <b>Bur</b> 6 p function as general repressors of the basal transcriptional machinery. The molecular cloning and characterization of <b>BUR</b> 3 and <b>BUR</b> 6 are presented here. <b>BUR</b> 3 {{is identical to}} MOT 1, a previously characterized essential gene that encodes an ATP-dependent inhibitor of the TATA box-binding protein. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that <b>BUR</b> 6 encodes a homolog of DRAP 1 (also called NC 2 alpha), a mammalian repressor of basal transcription. Strains that contain a <b>bur</b> 6 null allele are viable but grow extremely poorly, demonstrating that <b>BUR</b> 6 is critical for normal cell growth in yeast. The <b>Bur</b> 6 p histone fold domain is required for function; an extensive nonoverlapping set of deletion alleles throughout the histone fold domain impairs <b>BUR</b> 6 function in vivo, whereas mutations in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails have no detectable effect. <b>BUR</b> 6 and <b>BUR</b> 3 /MOT 1 have different functions depending on promoter context: although the <b>bur</b> 3 - 1 and <b>bur</b> 6 - 1 mutations increase transcription from delta uas promoters, they result in reduced transcription from the wild-type GAL 1 and GAL 10 promoters. This transcriptional defect {{is due to the}} inability of the GAL 10 UAS to function in <b>bur</b> 6 - 1 strains. The similar phenotypes of <b>bur</b> 6 and <b>bur</b> 3 (mot 1) mutations suggest that <b>Bur</b> 6 p and Mot 1 p have related, but not identical, functions in modulating the activity of the general transcription machinery in vivo...|$|R

In this paper, three low-cost techniques for micro-displacement measurement with high accuracy are discussed, and they are the methods based on DVD optical head, <b>burred</b> images and stop-action images. The techniques based on the DVD optical head and <b>burred</b> images are very attractive for many applications where the low cost is indispensable, and the method based on stop-action images has also better performance when measuring the static micro-displacement. Then, an application based on the stop-action images approach is given, and this method can measure the micro-displacement with nanometer accuracy. In addition, these discussions show that the methods based on the DVD optical head and <b>burred</b> images are a possible direction for low-cost micro-displacement measurement with high accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy of Polymer <b>bur</b> (Smartprep) and Conventional <b>burs</b> (Carbide <b>bur</b> & Diamond Points) in selective Dentin caries removal. Materials and method: 15 freshly extracted carious human premolars and molars {{were selected for}} this study. These teeth were split {{in the center of}} carious lesion, in order to obtain two corresponding half. Thus 30 samples were prepared in this way. These were randomly divided in to 3 groups of 10 samples each. Group 1 : The carious portion of these samples was excavated with the help of polymer <b>bur</b> Smartprep (SS White). Group 3 : Prepared with Tungsten carbide round <b>bur</b> (No. 018). Group 3 : Prepared with the help of Diamond points (No. 018). The period of time involved in this process is measured. After excavation of all carious lesions, a longitudinal section from mid most part of lesion was obtain with the help of diamond disc at slow speed. After staining with caries detector dye “Seek”, the sections were subjected to histological evaluation under stereomicro-scope. The thickness of remaining caries is measured in more or less than 1 mm.

40|$|The {{increase}} in losses due to burrs occurring on cut edges of electrical steel laminations in transformer cores {{is difficult to}} quantify. Artificial burrs were applied to a 350 kVA, three-phase, five packet, transformer core. Total core loss, flux density distribution and local loss near the burrs were measured. Burrs applied to {{a portion of a}} packet of laminations in one limb caused the flux distribution to become more nonuniform than normal throughout the whole core. Local losses increased significantly outside the burr region. The loss increased to over 1000 W/kg in the severely <b>burred</b> region at 1. 8 T, 50 Hz. Measured flux distribution data was used in simplified eddy current calculations to predict the total and localized losses.

40|$|Arthropod growth {{requires}} molt-associated {{changes in}} softness and stiffness of the cuticle that protects from desiccation, infection and injury. Cuticle hardening in insects {{depends on the}} blood-borne hormone, bursicon (<b>Burs),</b> although {{it has never been}} determined in hemolymph. Whilst also having <b>Burs,</b> decapod crustaceans reiterate molting many more times during their longer life span and are encased in a calcified exoskeleton, which after molting undergoes similar initial cuticle hardening processes as in insects. We investigated the role of homologous crustacean <b>Burs</b> in cuticular changes and growth in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. We found dramatic increases in size and number of <b>Burs</b> cells during development in paired thoracic ganglion complex (TGC) neurons with pericardial organs (POs) as neurohemal release sites. A skewed expression of <b>Burs</b> b/Burs a mRNA in TGC corresponds to protein contents of identified <b>Burs</b> b homodimer and <b>Burs</b> heterodimer in POs. In hemolymph, <b>Burs</b> is consistently present at, 21 pM throughout the molt cycle, showing a peak of, 89 pM at ecdysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most of the physician's {{attention}} during spinal surgery, {{when using}} wires and screws, is toward {{the avoidance of}} injuries of critical structures (nerves and vessels). When such wires are broken during surgery, the most important point is {{to take them out}} safely or, if it is impossible, to leaf them in secure place and follow the patient closely. Migrations of broken Kirschner wire (K-wire) are well known in literature; however, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, migration of a fractured K-wire during anterior atlantoaxial fixation of cervical spine has not been reported in the literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case in which a fractured K-wire was imbedded in the lateral mass of C 1 for 3 years and then migrated to endanger the dominant right vertebral artery. By using posterior approach and drilling right part of posterior arch of C 1, we manage to secure the vertebral artery. The broken K-wire was extracted successfully. In our case, with optimal follow-up, the <b>burred</b> wire inside hard bone was moved in delayed fashion to come out of the bone, grooving the dominant vertebral artery.

While the mechanisms regulating the Cdks involved in cell cycle progression are well documented, much less is known regarding how the Cdks {{that are involved}} in transcription are regulated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, <b>Bur</b> 1 and <b>Bur</b> 2 comprise a Cdk complex that is involved in transcriptional regulation, presumably mediated by its phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. To investigate the regulation of <b>Bur</b> 1 in vivo, we searched for high-copy-number suppressors of a <b>bur</b> 1 temperature-sensitive mutation, identifying a single gene, CAK 1.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the effect of {{projection}} angle errors on reconstructing 3 D electron tomography. Noise, missing wedge and miss alignment are three main problems in electron tomography. This thesis focuses on how miss alignment affects the 3 D reconstruction relative to the noise and missing wedge effects. Fourier-based iterative method (FIRM) is the main reconstruction method in this work. Instead of projecting the volume and back-projecting the tilt series in the image domain, FIRM conducts those operations in Frequency domain. By using non-uniform fast Fourier transform, FIRM avoids interpolation problem. Besides, the conjugate gradient method is used as the iterative reconstruction process to ﬁnd the optimal solution. With the simulations, the impacts of noise, missing wedge and miss alignment are studied quantitatively. Missing wedge is the most inﬂuential factor among those three factors, the lack of enough information causes the reconstruction volume to be highly <b>burred.</b> Miss alignment has a similar effect as Gaussian noise. However, miss alignment also introduces artifacts in the reconstruction. Normalized mean-square error (NMSE) decreases and resolution increases when decreasing the level of miss alignment.

40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of tool wear can affect cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality in ultra-precision fly cutting (UPFC), {{there has been no}} research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, wear land formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the cutting chips and machined surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes cutting chips, and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation of wear land on the cutting edge makes the machined surface <b>burred</b> and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface. By analyzing the captured cutting force, it is found that the progress of tool wear in UPFC can increase the cutting force and its power spectral density at the natural frequency of the dynamometer. Findings from the research provide rich insight into the relationships of tool wear characteristics to cutting forces, chip formation, and machined surface quality in intermittent cutting processes.

40|$|The cores of {{electrical}} machines are generally punched and laminated {{to reduce the}} eddy current losses. These manufacturing processes such as punching and cutting deform the electrical sheets and deteriorate its magnetic properties. Burrs are formed due to plastic deformation {{of electrical}} sheets. Burr formed due to punching {{on the edges of}} laminated sheets impairs the insulation of adjacent sheet and make random galvanic contacts during the pressing of stacked sheets. The effect of circulating current occurs if the burrs occur on the opposite edges of the stacks of laminated sheets and incase of bolted or wielded sheets, induced current return through it. This induced current causes the additional losses in electrical machine. The existence of surface current on the boundary between two insulated regions causes discontinuity of tangential component of magnetic field. Hence, based on this principle, the boundary layer model was developed to study the additional losses due to galvanic contacts formed by <b>burred</b> edges.
