5|$|In 1932, Fairbanks' two-story school, {{built in}} 1907, <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> A new, $150,000 three-story {{concrete}} art deco building was proposed as a replacement, and after heated debate, a $100,000 bond measure was approved in 1933. On January 22, 1934, {{the new school}} opened. It had space for about 500 students, but the town's growth required renovation and expansion in 1939 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise {{from the ashes of}} the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|The Tudor Revival-style Briarcliff Lodge {{was opened}} in 1902 as a premier resort hotel.

5|$|A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its {{assault in}} 161 AD, {{defeating}} two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E
5|$|At its 1902 opening, the Briarcliff Lodge was {{a premier}} resort hotel. The Tudor Revival-style {{building}} {{was surrounded by}} dairy barns and greenhouses (built by Law), and hosted numerous distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The hotel declined during the 1930s but the lodge remained in use, housing the Edgewood Park School (1936–1954) and The King's College (1955–1994). The original 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> on September 20, 2003, and contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E

An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept's north wall. The southern transept {{is named for}} Chester Alwyn Braman, the first donor to the University Chapel Fund. A staircase leads from the Braman Transept to the Bright Pulpit.|$|E
5|$|Tupper's role as {{the founder}} of the first {{university}} dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition. During the Reconstruction era, his home was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> by the Ku Klux Klan. He and his wife fled and hid in a nearby cornfield. In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Himeji {{was heavily}} bombed in 1945, {{at the end}} of World War II, and {{although}} most of the surrounding area was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the castle survived intact. One firebomb was dropped {{on the top floor of}} the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor expenditure of 250,000 man-days and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged, demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance. Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place.|$|E

5|$|The bishopric of Aarhus {{dates back}} to at least 948 when Adam of Bremen {{reported}} the bishop Reginbrand attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany. The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth {{and development of the}} early medieval town. The finding of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as Harald Hardrada's assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the results, {{paramilitary}} groups had begun attacking people and setting fires around the capital Dili. Foreign journalists and election observers fled, {{and tens of thousands}} of East Timorese took to the mountains. Islamic gangs attacked Dili's Catholic Diocese building, killing two dozen people; the next day, the headquarters of the ICRC was attacked and <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Almost one hundred people were killed later in Suai, and reports of similar massacres poured in from around East Timor. The UN withdrew most of its personnel, but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees.|$|E
5|$|At age {{seventeen}} he apprentices as {{a blacksmith}} and learns to fight, {{and it is}} during his period his mother dies. He then moved to the city-state of Wide where he insinuates himself with the ruler and overthrows him. Five years later, Gustaves father dies, and {{at the behest of}} his best friend Kelvin decides to claim the throne. A war then breaks out between Gustave XIII and his half-brother in which Gustave conquers Finney and becomes the ruler of all the surrounding kingdoms except Na. This one holdout is controlled by Phillip, Gustave's brother, who blames Gustave for their mother's death. During the subsequent conflict, Gustave admits he lacks magical powers, and abdicates in favor of Phillip. Gustave then build a city of his own called Hahn Nova, but it is overrun by monsters and <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The fate of Gustave and his friends is left a mystery.|$|E

5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{remainder}} of the day, the Italians collected the bodies of their dead from the rebel ambush on 28 June, and rescued some Home Guard troops that had escaped Avtovac, but then returned to Plana, just north of Bileća. The value of further operations in the Gacko and Avtovac areas was brought into question when the Italians reported that both towns had been <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and all the inhabitants had been massacred. The Italians blamed Montenegrins attached to the rebels for the destruction and killings in the two towns. The Italian estimate of rebel strength was around 3,000 armed with machine guns, artillery and anti-aircraft guns. A German intelligence officer from Sarajevo arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to receive a briefing on the situation. The small garrison of Gacko was anticipating an attack by rebels during the night, but in the afternoon 180 Home Guardsmen that had withdrawn from Avtovac arrived to bolster their position, and the night passed without incident.|$|E
5|$|Hardy met {{his girlfriend}} Beth Britt in 1999, {{shortly after the}} Hardy Boyz had won the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time. Hardy and his brother Matt went to a club in Southern Pines, North Carolina, where Hardy met her. On March 15, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Hardy's house had <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in a fire. Hardy and his girlfriend were not home at the time, but his dog, Jack, was killed in the fire. It is believed that the fire was started by faulty electrical wiring. In October 2008, Hardy was building a new home in the same area, which was expected to be completed by early 2009. In August 2010, Hardy announced that Britt was pregnant with the couple's first child, a daughter named Ruby Claire Hardy, who was born on October 19, 2010. The pair's second child, a daughter, Nera Quinn Hardy, was born on December 31, 2015. Hardy married Britt on March 9, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Supreme Court, {{business}} was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first public building to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In 1876, the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor. This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet, while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25, 1935.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, {{daughter}} of Count Daniel O'Mahony—a wealthy merchant and former Irish general—spending {{much of the}} remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife. Cantillon and Mary had two children, a son who died at an early age and a daughter, Henrietta, who would go on to marry William Howard Earl of Stafford in 1743. Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence was in London. In , his residence in London was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire's causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered. One of Cantillon's biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in Suriname under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.|$|E
