40|$|A superplastic-like forming (SPLF) process {{involving}} {{the use of}} hot drawing along with <b>blow</b> <b>forming</b> is studied here. The hot drawing stage helps in enhancing the formability and in fast forming the metal sheet into a hollow shape with desired amount of material draw-in. During the <b>blow</b> <b>forming</b> stage, gas pressure was applied onto the pre-formed part to complete the forming process at a targeted strain rate. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheets have been successfully formed by this process at 800 Â°C in 16 min.

40|$|In {{carrying}} out a superplastic forming process, the first step for the process optimization is a detailed material characterization. The achievement of a successfully formed component is strictly related to the material behaviour: commonly, several tensile tests are carried out at different temperatures and strain rates for locating the best deformation parameters, corresponding to which maximum uniform elongation of the material can be found. Additionally, characterization is needed also for estimating material parameters to numerically model the process. Numerical modelling is a necessary step when the pressure profile of a <b>blow</b> <b>forming</b> process has to be optimized. In this paper authors present a methodology for estimating material parameters {{on the basis of}} few bulge tests and for analysing the superplastic forming process. Temperature and pressure influences are analysed by means of free inflation tests. Material parameters are calculated starting from an analytical approach and refining the solution by an inverse analysis. A 3 D numerical model of the process has been then created and used for evaluating the pressure profile that is able to keep the strain rate value in the sheet close to a target value. A numerical-experimental comparison has been done for testing the model capability and effectiveness of the pressure profile in a prismatic closed die <b>blow</b> <b>forming</b> test. Good agreement has been found between experimental results and numerical simulations.

A commercial grade AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheet with the grain size of 15 Î¼m could have an elongation over 300 % over 400 Â°C. However, elongation did not show a strong strain rate and temperature dependencies which could be easily found in most superplastic aluminum alloys. It might result from that AZ 31 would be vulnerable to cavitation even at the early stage of deformation. It was also found that hydrostatic stress was not effective to prevent evolution of cavities during <b>blow</b> <b>forming,</b> which was much different with the case in most superplastic alloys. Both low strain rate dependency of elongation and ineffectiveness of hydrostatic stress might be originated from poor accommodation slip for grain boundary sliding of AZ 31 even at high temperature where non basal slip systems were activated...|$|E

Various thermomechanical processing routes, such as annealing, conventional rolling, severe rolling and cross rolling, were used in order to fabricate AZ 31 and AZ 61 alloys with different grain sizes. These materials were then <b>blow</b> <b>formed</b> into a hat shaped die. It was found that the processing route has only a small effect in the formability of MgâAl alloys or on the postforming microstructures and properties due to rapid dynamic grain growth taking place at the forming temperatures. Nevertheless, good formability is achieved as a result of the simultaneous operation of grain boundary sliding and crystallographic slip during forming.
