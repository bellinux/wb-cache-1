40|$|The light {{transmission}} through a tunnel junction in a multijunction solar cell {{depends on the}} optical properties and thickness of the whole solar cell layers stack, which configure the light absorption, reflection and interference processes taking place inside the semiconductor structure. In this paper the focus is put on the AlGaAs <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> of p++AlGaAs/n++GaAs and p++AlGaAs/n++GaInP tunnel junctions inserted into a GaInP/GaAs dualjunction solar cell.

25|$|Two {{processes}} {{play a role}} in {{a solder}} joint formation: interaction between the substrate and molten solder, and solid-state growth of intermetallic compounds. The base metal dissolves in the molten solder in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal. The solid-state reactions are more complex – the formation of intermetallics can be inhibited by changing the composition of the base metal or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> to inhibit diffusion of the metals.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{different}} from ΓLO, a monotonic increase in Γimp is observed with decreasing LW. The coefficient Γimp {{is thought to}} be a measurement for the scattering of shallow donor defects and impurities such as oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials, hydrogen, etc. Generally, the Γimp depends on the density of defect and impurity sites. Contrary to the distribution of defects in the ZnO QW with different LWs as indicated in the above analysis, we suppose that defects, impurities, and composition fluctuation in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> are the dominant scatters. For the narrow QW geometry, the exciton wave function penetrates deeply into the adjacent <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> [27], and therefore, the scattering coming from the <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> is remarkable. As the well thickness increases, the extension of the exciton wave function into the <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> is suppressed; hence, the influence of defect and impurity scattering was sufficiently reduced, leading to a decrease of Γimp with increasing LW. In addition, in the large-LW range, the defects induced by the strain relaxation in the QW may also contribute to the scattering process, showing a slow decreasing trend in Γimp with increasing LW.|$|R
