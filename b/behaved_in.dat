5|$|The Dutch {{released}} {{reports of}} German soldiers in disguise {{to the international}} news agencies. This caused a fifth column scare, especially in Belgium and France. However, unlike the situation later on in those two countries, in the Netherlands there was no mass exodus of civilian refugees, clogging the roads. Generally German soldiers <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a civilised manner towards the Dutch population, forming neat queues at the shops to buy goods rationed in Germany, such as chocolate.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E
5000|$|Consensus: The {{extent to}} which other people <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> the same way. There is high {{consensus}} when most people behave consistent with a given action/actor. Low consensus is when not many people <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> this way.|$|R

5000|$|Consistency: The {{extent to}} which a person usually <b>behaves</b> <b>in</b> a given way. There is high {{consistency}} when a person almost always <b>behaves</b> <b>in</b> a specific way. Low consistency is when a person almost never behaves like this.|$|R
5|$|It {{would take}} FDR another five years, {{with the help}} of the League of Women Voters to replace Stevens. Making the {{argument}} that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with Mary Nelson Winslow. Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with Eleanor Roosevelt backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens. Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> an unladylike manner.|$|E
5|$|South Street Community Primary School at the {{northern}} end of Deckham in Cramer Street and caters for pupils in the 3–11 age range. The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. In the most recent OFSTED inspection, the nursery provision was praised for enabling children who enter the school with skills below that expected of similarly–aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery provision was good overall. The primary provision was praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment in which children are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well <b>behaved.</b> <b>In</b> all inspection categories, the primary provision was judged good.|$|E
25|$|Holy Bull was the {{favorite}} in the 1994 Kentucky Derby but after breaking poorly, he finished a distant 12th on a sloppy track. Croll later claimed that the horse must have been tampered with, as he had <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> an uncharacteristically lethargic manner before the race. Holy Bull was treated for several days after the race with antibiotics against a possible infection and missed {{a few days of}} training.|$|E

25|$|A May 2010 paper {{discussed}} a small device's ability to capture electrons. The paper posited that the machine had an ideal magnetic field strength that maximized {{its ability to}} catch electrons. The paper analyzed magnetic confinement in the polywell using analytical solutions and simulations. The work linked the magnetic confinement in the polywell to magnetic mirror theory. The 2011 work used Particle-in-cell simulations to model particle motion in polywells with a small electron population. Electrons <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner to particles in the biconic cusp.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Pini Herman and David LaFontaine, in a {{study of}} Israeli emigrants in Los Angeles, found high levels of Jewish affiliation, Jewish {{organizational}} participation and concentration in Jewish neighborhoods by Israeli emigrants. Israeli emigrants who <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a comparatively secular manner in Israel tended to behave in a more devoutly Jewish manner in Los Angeles and Israeli emigrants who reported greater Jewish behaviors in Israel tended to engage in Jewish behaviors to a lesser degree in Los Angeles, thus both becoming more 'Americanized' in their Jewish behaviors.|$|E
25|$|More {{material}} evidence exists for {{the ecology of}} B. advenus than for any other member of the Hesperornithes, {{with the possible exception}} of Hesperornis regalis, but still much is left to conjecture. The loon-sized bird was of middle size among its relatives and had a markedly elongated neck. Presumably, it thus <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a manner similar to today's darters, hunting smaller, more mobile prey than its larger relatives. Unlike a darter however, it could not spear its prey, but instead held it with its beak like today's mergansers.|$|E
50|$|Cognitive {{development}} theory {{argues that}} children are active in defining gender and <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> ways that reflect their perceptions of gender roles. Children are in search of regularities and consistencies in their environment, {{and the pursuit of}} cognitive consistency motivates children to <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> ways that are congruent with the societal constructions of gender.|$|R

25|$|Dr. Paul Lemoine of Nantes, France {{had already}} {{published}} {{a study in}} a French medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics, and in the U.S., Christy Ulleland and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School had conducted an 18-month study in 1968–1969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers. The Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1979. Researchers in France, Sweden, and the United States were struck by how similar these children looked, though they were not related, and how they <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> the same unfocused and hyperactive manner.|$|E
25|$|Determinacy {{refers to}} the fact that, under {{appropriate}} assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start {{in the sense that}} one player must have a winning strategy. The existence of these strategies has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The axiom of determinacy (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well <b>behaved</b> (<b>in</b> particular, measurable and with the perfect set property). AD can be used to prove that the Wadge degrees have an elegant structure.|$|E
25|$|In his {{campaign}} in Hispania, Cato <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> keeping with his reputation of untiring {{hard work and}} alertness. He lived soberly, sharing {{the food and the}} labours of the common soldier. Wherever it was possible, he personally superintended the execution of his requisite orders. His movements were reported as bold and rapid, and he never was negligent in pushing the advantages of victory. The sequence of his operations and their combination in agreement with the schemes of other generals in other parts of Hispania appear to have been carefully designed. His stratagems and manoeuvres were accounted as original, talented, and successful; and the plans of his battles were arranged with expert skill. He managed to set tribe against tribe, benefited himself from native deceitfulness, and took native mercenaries into his pay.|$|E
50|$|Behavioralism studies how {{individuals}} <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> group positions realistically rather than {{how they should}} behave. For example, {{a study of the}} United States Congress might include a consideration of how members of Congress <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an 'arena of actions' and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.|$|R

25|$|The law {{enforcement}} agencies have since been heavily criticised by the Honourable Mr Justice Woo V-P, the Commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance. He remarked that some {{law enforcement}} officers were dishonest and unwilling to cooperate, <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> an arrogant and presumptuous manner that was bordering on recalcitrance, and disobeyed orders by deleting relevant recordings of covert surveillance. It was also revealed that the government relied on a Canadian precedent to question the Commissioner's power to access covert surveillance recordings, and that a legislative amendment {{may be required to}} clarify the situation. An outrage was caused when it was revealed ICAC officers spent four days tapping a man's phone line although their target was a supposed to be female. Also revealed were four cases of unauthorised ICAC tapping of phone conversations between lawyers and their clients in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Legend has it {{that after}} many {{previous}} attempts, the Portuguese knight Martim Moniz led {{an attack on the}} castle doors and when he saw the Moors closing them, blocked the doorway with his own body, allowing his companions to enter, and was crushed. With the success of the crusaders' assault on the city's walls with siege engines, the Moors capitulated on 22 October. According to an account by the priest Raol addressed to Osbert of Bawdsley (Osbernus), Germans from Cologne and the Flemish cohort violated their oaths to the king of Portugal after entering the city and plundered it. These crusaders <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> a wanton manner, looting Muslims and Mozarabs indiscriminately, debauching virgins and even cutting the throat of the elderly Mozarab bishop. Afterwards, an epidemic of the plague killed thousands among the Mozarabic and the Muslim populations.|$|E
25|$|Zhong Hui {{had long}} harboured the {{intention}} of rebelling against Wei. When he saw that Deng Ai <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> an autocratic manner even though his military command was authorised by the Wei imperial court, he secretly reported to the court that Deng was plotting a rebellion. He was skilled in imitating people's handwriting. After getting his hands on a report written by Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court, he edited the report {{to make it sound}} arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai to increase Sima's suspicions towards Deng. The Wei government fell for Zhong Hui's ruse and ordered Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to Luoyang in a prison cart. Sima Zhao was worried that Deng Ai would not submit, so he ordered Zhong Hui and Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai. With Zhong Hui and his troops following behind, Wei Guan went to Deng Ai's camp in Chengdu and used Sima Zhao's letter of authorisation to order Deng's soldiers to put down their weapons. Deng Ai was arrested and placed in a prison cart.|$|E

25|$|Learning {{in early}} life is {{apparently}} important to all parrots, {{and much of}} that learning is social learning. Social interactions are often practised with siblings, and in several species, creches are formed with several broods, and these, too, are important for learning social skills. Foraging behaviour is generally learnt from parents, and {{can be a very}} protracted affair. Suprageneralists and specialists generally become independent of their parents much quicker than partly specialised species who may have to learn skills over long periods as various resources become seasonally available. Play forms a large part of learning in parrots; it can be solitary, and related to motor skills, or social. Species may engage in play fights or wild flights to practice predator evasion. An absence of stimuli can delay the development of young birds, as demonstrated by a group of vasa parrots kept in tiny cages with domesticated chickens from the age of 3 months; at 9 months, these birds still <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> the same way as 3-month-olds, but had adopted some chicken behaviour. In a similar fashion, captive birds in zoo collections or pets can, if deprived of stimuli, develop stereotyped behaviours and harmful behaviours like self plucking. Aviculturists working with parrots have identified the need for environmental enrichment to keep parrots stimulated.|$|E
25|$|After about a month, Yang Zhao {{failed to}} {{overcome}} Lu Kang and {{had run out}} of ideas so he withdrew his army on one night. Lu Kang wanted to pursue the enemy but he was worried that Bu Chan (who was still inside Xiling) might use the opportunity to attack him from behind, and he did not have enough troops with him. He then ordered his men to beat the drums and pretend to prepare to attack Yang Zhao's retreating forces. When Yang Zhao's men saw that, they were so terrified that they abandoned their armour and equipment and fled. Lu Kang sent a small group of lightly-armed soldiers to pursue Yang Zhao and they inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy. Yang Hu and the other Jin generals withdrew their armies after receiving news of Yang Zhao's defeat. Lu Kang then attacked and conquered Xiling. Bu Chan, along with his family and high-ranking officers, were executed for treason, while the others, numbering over 10,000, were pardoned after Lu Kang made a request to the Wu court. Lu Kang then had Xiling's fortifications repaired before returning east to Yue District (樂鄉). He remained humble after his victory in Xiling and still <b>behaved</b> <b>in</b> the same manner as he did before. His humility earned him the respect and favour of his men.|$|E
