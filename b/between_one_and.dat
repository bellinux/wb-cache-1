5|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} fifty-three {{settlements}} in the republic, accounting for 23.3% of the republic's rural localities and for about 15% of its rural population. The population of a typical settlement is <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> two thousand, averaging 750. Although in existence {{for less than a}} century, the settlements' combined population is now almost equal to that of the khutors.|$|E

5|$|In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters breed {{throughout}} the year, with no fixed breeding season, {{but a large}} number are born in the summer months. In the wild, three to four litters are produced each year, {{with an average of}} eight offspring per litter. In captivity, females can have <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> 18 litters per year, with one to nine offspring per litter.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} by E.O.

According to this estimate, the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race. Also, according to this estimate, there are approximately 1 million ants for every human on Earth.|$|E

Playing with less than five players, including single player, is possible in all modes due to computer-controlled bots.

Players can also switch to play as another class instantly in a single-player match.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping {{the surface of the}} ocean with its tail <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E

5|$|When {{suitable}} {{areas were}} found, groups of refugees usually numbering <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> three thousand were trucked {{to the site}} and began creating the new settlement.

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{and their}} players {{pleaded guilty to}} the charges against them, but still {{received}} a £175,000 fine, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren, Martin Keown, Patrick Vieira and Ray Parlour were all suspended for <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> four matches: Lauren received a four-game ban – half of the potential ban he could have received – and a £40,000 fine; Keown was suspended for three matches and had to pay a £20,000 fine; Vieira and Parlour were given one-game bans and had to pay £20,000 and £10,000 respectively. Jens Lehmann was originally charged but this was later dropped. Ashley Cole was not suspended but was given a £10,000 fine. Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo both {{pleaded not guilty to}} their involvement in the incident, but after a five-hour hearing in December 2003, Giggs was handed a £7,500 fine and Ronaldo a £4,000 fine and both were warned about their future conduct.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} 102khutors in the republic, mostly found in three areas: {{to the north}} of Maykop; in the northeast, along the Laba River; and in the {{predominantly}} aul zone {{in the western part of}} the republic. Each usually has a population of <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> five hundred, although some exceed one thousand. Together they account for 44.9% of the republic's rural localities, but only for 15% of the rural population. In 1926, the populations in 4% of the khutors exceeded five hundred; by 2000, this had risen to 18%.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can}} also grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s Chelsea Bridge {{became a}} {{favourite}} meeting place for motorcyclists, who would race {{across the bridge}} on Friday nights. On 17 October 1970 a serious confrontation took place on Chelsea Bridge between the Essex and Chelsea chapters of the Hells Angels, and rival motorcycle gangs the Road Rats, Nightingales, Windsor Angels and Jokers. Around 50 people {{took part in the}} fight; weapons used included motorcycle chains, flick knives and at least one spiked flail. One member of the Jokers was shot with a sawn-off shotgun and fatally wounded, and 20 of those present were sentenced to <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> twelve years imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but may produce <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{continued}} to practice law. In 1962, his wife Ruth obtained an interlocutory divorce decree against him. After the decree became final, Chotiner married again in 1965. In January 1966, attorney and land developer Charles W. Hinman {{was arrested and}} charged with plotting to have Chotiner murdered. Chotiner had represented Hinman's wife in a contested divorce case, and Hinman had been jailed for eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to <b>between</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> five years in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E
