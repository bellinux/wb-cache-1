5|$|Roosevelt won the 1940 presidential election. After Minton {{left office}} in January 1941, {{he was given}} a {{position}} in the Roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure. He served as one of the president's advisers and a liaison <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and Congress.

Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions. He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency.|$|E

25|$|The WHCD {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticized {{as an example}} of the coziness <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press corps and the administration. The dinner typically includes a skit, either live or videotaped, by the sitting president in which he mocks himself, for the amusement of the press corps. The press corps, in turn, hobnobs with administration officials, even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press. Increasing scrutiny by bloggers has contributed to added public focus on this friendliness.|$|E
25|$|The textile {{question}} {{played a}} role in West's election, as thousands of mill workers who had strayed from the Democratic Party to support George C. Wallace's independent candidacy returned to their ancestral political home. Each party blamed the other for the failure to obtain import restrictions. Democrats expressed alarm that textile workers were losing jobs as plants were unable to compete on the world market. Democrats urged President Nixon through executive orders to curtail clothing imports from the Far East; Republicans insisted that only Congress had the legal authority to limit the importation of man-made fabrics. Presidential counselor Harry S. Dent, Sr., of South Carolina, another former aide to Strom Thurmond and the liaison official <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and the state GOP organizations, said that the administration was meeting with foreign competitors to devise voluntary restraints.

This was near <b>the</b> halfway point <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Capitol and <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> For many years after National Prohibition, it ironically sat in front of the Apex Liquor Store, which operated in the ground floor of the Central National Bank Building.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{division}} <b>between</b> {{northern and}} southern Democrats allowed the Republicans to win a plurality in the House in the elections of 1858. Their control of the chamber allowed the Republicans to block most of Buchanan's agenda. Buchanan, in turn, vetoed six substantial pieces of Republican legislation, causing further hostility <b>between</b> Congress and <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Among <b>the</b> pieces of legislation that Buchanan vetoed were the Homestead Act, which would have given 160 acres of public land to settlers who remained on the land for five years, and the Morrill Act, which would have granted public lands to establish land-grant colleges.

Morton's duties blurred the line between his public and political duties, and caused controversy concerning how Morton would divide his time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and Ford's election campaign, and how much of his salary would be supplied by taxpayers versus the Ford election committee. In rebuttal, Morton stated [...] "you can't separate government from politics", and that Presidential aides should be allowed to offer political advice.|$|E

At a bipartisan meeting at the White House on September 25 (pictured) McCain came across as unconstructive and ineffectual to Bush, who felt that McCain had forced him to hold a pointless meeting and then had said nothing at it.|$|E

This writing will focus on the tax provisions proposed for noncorporate taxpayers. The contract has encountered many changes since its inception in 1994. The House, Senate, and President each propose different perspectives on the tax provisions contained in the "Contract.

However, Comey contended that the incident, (which had culminated in a heated phone conversation following the hospital visit,) had indeed been over the activities comprising the TSP. Through a spokesperson, Gonzales later denied his original assertion that the dispute was over TSP, claiming that he had misspoken.

40|$|Beyond {{what each}} {{candidate}} broadly claims {{he would do}} with the economy, and given the global economic context, what {{is most likely to}} happen in the alternative economic scenarios of a Bush or a Kerry Presidency? The default scenario for Bush is one in which his desires to continue with policies which either increase the deficit or fail to pro-actively cut it, run into the increasing scepticism of Congress and the Federal Reserve. While this will allow growth to slow, <b>the</b> conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Bush <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> on <b>the</b> one hand, and the Congress and the Fed on the other, could by itself spook the markets into the beginnings of a dollar crisis.

The default scenario for Kerry would be to muddle through with no clear policy coherence, within the constraints laid down by a suspicious Congress and an increasingly hawkish Fed.
