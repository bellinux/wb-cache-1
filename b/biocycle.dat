Analytical instruments, primarily gas chromatographs (GC), are capable of measuring gases and volatiles to the ppb-level in real time. Trace gases significant in the study of <b>biocycles</b> include nitrous oxide, hydrogen sulfide, other nitrogen and sulfur species, as well as methane and ethylene. The concept of a field gas chromatograph is derived from technology being pursued in the design of ultra-compact instruments for solar system exploration. The instrument breadboard incorporates the specialized porous column packings and the highly sensitive metastable ionization detector developed by the Solar System Exploration Office. These parts ensure a broad capability for which the analysis of ambient N 2 O is one example.

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} adiposity on patterns of sex hormones across the menstrual cycle among regularly menstruating women. Subjects—The <b>BioCycle</b> Study followed 239 healthy women for 1 – 2 menstrual cycles, with up to 8 visits per cycle timed using fertility monitors. Methods—Serum estradiol (E 2), progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured at each visit. Adiposity was measured by anthropometry and by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Differences in hormonal patterns by adiposity measures were estimated using nonlinear mixed models, which allow for comparisons in overall mean levels, amplitude (i. e. lowest to highest level within each cycle), and shifts in timing of peaks while adjusting for age, race, energy intake, and physical activity. Results—Compared to normal weight women (n= 154), obese women (BMI≥ 30 kg/m 2, n= 25) averaged lower levels of progesterone (− 15 %, P= 0. 003), LH (− 17 %, P= 0. 01), FSH (− 23 %, P= 0. 001) and higher free E 2 (+ 22 %, p= 0. 001) across the cycle.

Associations with measured body fat, including regional adiposity, have not been previously investigated. We examined the associations between the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED), anthropometry and measured adiposity by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subjects/Methods—This study included 248 healthy females, aged 18 – 44 years from the <b>BioCycle</b> Study. Each woman’s aMED (range 0 – 9) was calculated from up to eight 24 -hr dietary recalls over 1 – 2 menstrual cycles (> 97 % had ≥ 7 recalls). Multiple linear regression was used to determine whether aMED and its specific components were associated with total and regional adiposity after adjusting for age, race, education, physical activity and energy intake.

40|$|Diagnostic trials {{often require}} the use of a {{homogeneity}} test among several markers. Such a test may be necessary to determine the power both during the design phase and in the initial analysis stage. However, no formal method is available for the power and sample size calculation when the number of markers is greater than two and marker measurements are clustered in subjects. This article presents two procedures for testing the accuracy among clustered diagnostic markers. The first procedure is a test of homogeneity among continuous markers based on a global null hypothesis of the same accuracy. The result under the alternative provides the explicit distribution for the power and sample size calculation. The second procedure is a simultaneous pairwise comparison test based on weighted areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. This test is particularly useful if a global difference among markers is found by the homogeneity test.

40|$|Planning {{study visits}} during {{specific}} menstrual cycle phases is important if the exposure or outcome {{is influenced by}} hormonal variation. However, hormone profiles differ across cycles and across women. The value of using fertility monitors to time clinic visits was evaluated in the <b>BioCycle</b> Study (2005 – 2007). Women aged 18 – 44 years (mean, 27. 4) with self-reported menstrual cycle lengths of 21 – 35 days were recruited in Buffalo, New York, for 2 cycles (n = 250). Participants were provided with home fertility monitors that measured urinary estrone- 3 -glucuronide and luteinizing hormone (LH). The women were instructed to visit the clinic for a blood draw when the monitor indicated an LH surge. The monitor recorded a surge during 76 % of the first cycles and 78 % of the second cycles. Scheduling visits by using set cycle days or algorithms based on cycle length, such as a midcycle window or a window determined by assuming a fixed luteal phase length, would be simpler. However, even with perfect attendance in a 3 -day window, these methods would have performed poorly, capturing the monitor-detected LH surge only 37 %– 57 % of the time. Fertility monitors appear to be useful in timing clinic visits in a compliant population with flexible schedules...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the estimation of}} the regression of an outcome Y on a covariate X, where X is unobserved, but a variable W that measures X with error is observed. A calibration sample that measures pairs of values of X and W is also available; we consider calibration samples where Y is measured (internal calibration) and not measured (external calibration). One common approach for measurement error correction is Regression Calibration (RC), which substitutes the unknown values of X by predictions from the regression of X on W estimated from the calibration sample. An alternative approach is to multiply impute the missing values of X given Y and W based on an imputation model, and then use multiple imputation (MI) combining rules for inferences. Most of current work assumes that the measurement error of W has a constant variance, whereas in many situations, the variance varies {{as a function of}} X. We consider extensions of the RC and MI methods that allow for heteroscedastic measurement error, and compare them by simulation. The MI method is shown to provide better inferences in this setting.

40|$|Reproductive {{hormone levels}} are highly {{variable}} among premenopausal women during the menstrual cycle. Accurate timing of hormone measurement is essential, especially when investigating day- or phase-specific effects. The <b>BioCycle</b> Study used daily urine home fertility monitors to help detect the luteinising hormone (LH) surge {{in order to}} schedule visits with biologically relevant windows of hormonal variability. However, as the LH surge is brief and cycles vary in length, relevant hormonal changes may not align with scheduled visits even when fertility monitors are used. Using monitor data, measurements were reclassified according to biological phase of the menstrual cycle to more accurate cycle phase categories. Longitudinal multiple imputation methods were applied after reclassification if no visit occurred during a given menstrual cycle phase. Reclassified cycles had more clearly defined hormonal profiles, with higher mean peak hormones (up to 141 %) and reduced variability (up to 71 %). We demonstrate the importance of realigning visits to biologically relevant windows when assessing phase- or day-specific effects and the feasibility of applying longitudinal multiple imputation methods. Our method has applications in settings where missing data may occur over time, where daily blood sampling for hormonal measurements is not feasible, and in other areas where timing is essential...|$|E
40|$|Menstrual {{bleeding}} {{patterns are}} considered relevant indicators of reproductive health, though {{few studies have}} evaluated patterns among regularly menstruating premenopausal women. The authors evaluated self-reported bleeding patterns, incidence of spotting, and associations with reproductive hormones among 201 women in the <b>BioCycle</b> Study (2005 – 2007) with 2 consecutive cycles. Bleeding patterns were assessed by using daily ques-tionnaires and pictograms. Marginal structural models were used to evaluate associations between endogenous hormone concentrations and subsequent total reported blood loss and bleeding length by weighted linear mixed-effects models and weighted parametric survival analysis models. Women bled for a median of 5 days (standard deviation: 1. 5) during menstruation, with heavier bleeding during the first 3 days. Only 4. 8 % of women experienced midcycle bleeding. Increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (b 0. 20, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 13, 0. 27) and progesterone (b 0. 06, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 03, 0. 09) throughout the cycle were associated with heavier menstrual bleeding, and higher follicle-stimulating hormone levels were associated with longer menses. Bleeding duration and volume were reduced after anovulatory compared with ovulatory cycles (geometric mean blood loss: 29. 6 vs. 47. 2 mL; P 0. 07).

Improved pregnancy rates have been documented after folic acid supplement use, suggesting a possible link with ovulation, however research is limited. Our objective was to evaluate the association between dietary folate intake, hormone levels, and sporadic anovulation in healthy, regularly menstruating women. Methodology/Principal Findings: The <b>BioCycle</b> study (2005 – 2007) prospectively followed 259 healthy women aged 18 – 44 years from the western New York region for up to 2 menstrual cycles. Total folate and specific sources of folate were assessed up to 4 times per cycle by 24 -hour recall. Estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were measured in serum up to 8 times per cycle, timed using fertility monitors. Anovulation was defined as a cycle with peak progesterone concentration # 5 ng/mL and no LH peak in the mid/late luteal phase. Higher intake of dietary folate (in dietary equivalents) across tertiles had a marginally significant association with greater luteal progesterone levels (P trend 0. 08). Higher intake of synthetic folate was significantly associated with higher luteal progesterone levels (P trend 0. 05).

One potential mechanism {{is the effect of}} cigarette smoking on reproductive hormones; however, studies evaluating associations between smoking and hormone levels are complicated by variability of hormones and timing of specimen collection. We evaluated smoking among women participating in the <b>BioCycle</b> Study, a longitudinal study of menstrual cycle function in healthy, premenopausal, regularly menstruating women (n = 259). Fertility monitors were used to help guide timing of specimen collection. Serum levels of oestradiol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and total sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) across phases of the menstrual cycle were compared between smokers and non-smokers. We observed statistically significant phase-specific differences in hormone levels between smokers and non-smokers. Compared with non-smokers, smokers had higher levels of FSH in the early follicular phase and higher LH at menses after adjusting for potential confounding factors of age, race, body mass index, parity, vigorous exercise, and alcohol and caffeine intake through inverse probability of treatment weights. No statistically significant differences were observed for oestradiol, progesterone or SHBG. These phase-specific differences in levels of LH and FSH in healthy, regularly menstruating women who are current smokers compared with non-smokers reflect one mechanism by which smoking may influence fertility and reproductive health...|$|E

However, pre- and postmenopausal women respond differently to fiber intake, suggesting that endogenous estradiol mediates the effect. The authors ’ objective {{was to determine the}} direct effect of fiber intake on lipoprotein cholesterol levels independent of estradiol among pre-menopausal women. The <b>BioCycle</b> Study, a prospective cohort study conducted at the State University of New York at Buffalo from 2005 to 2007, followed 259 healthy women for up to 2 complete menstrual cycles. Serum lipoprotein and hormone levels were measured at 16 visits timed using fertility monitors. Fiber intake was assessed by 8 24 -hour recalls. Marginal structural models with inverse probability weights for both lipoprotein and estradiol levels were used to estimate controlled direct effects of the highest category of fiber intake (22 g/day vs. < 22 g/day) while accounting for age, body mass index, total energy, vitamin E intake, physical activity, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and progesterone. Reductions were observed in total and low density lipoprotein cho-lesterol in women with higher fiber intakes. Direct effects were greater than total effects.

Women aged 18 – 44 years from western New York were followed prospectively for up to 2 menstrual cycles (n 259). Serum levels of CRP, estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were measured up to 8 times per cycle, timed by fertility monitors. CRP levels varied significantly across the cycle (P 3 mg/L) during menses compared with other phases (12. 3 % vs. 7. 4 %; P < 0. 001). A 10 -fold increase in estradiol was associated with a 24. 3 % decrease in CRP (95 % confidence interval: 19. 3, 29. 0). A 10 -fold increase in luteal progesterone was associated with a 19. 4 % increase in CRP (95 % confidence interval: 8. 4, 31. 5).

40|$|Anovulation {{accounts}} for approximately 12 {{percent of all}} female infertility in the United States. Prior studies suggest women with high body mass index (BMI) have {{an increased risk of}} infertility, particularly obese women with abnormal cycle lengths. To date no studies have examined the relationship between measures of adiposity, including BMI and percent body fat measured by DXA scan (%BF), and anovulation among women with regular menstrual cycles assessed with biomarkers. We evaluated this association using data from the <b>BioCycle</b> study, a prospective cohort of 259 women with regular menstrual cycles. All measures of adiposity and covariates were collected at baseline. Anovulation was assessed via luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels in urine samples collected 16 times throughout two menstrual cycles. A total of 34 women had at least one anovulatory cycle during the study. Unadjusted models for BMI show a significant decrease in risk comparing highest BMI quartile to the lowest, (OR: 0. 29; 95 % CI. 090 -. 968). Once multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for age no significant associations were found in any BMI quartile, but point estimates did not change significantly. Similar trends were found using other measures of adiposity. Results show that there is a non-significant inverse trend between adiposity and anovulation in healthy women with regular menstrual cycles. This relationship can possibly be explained by age due to the influence of time since menarche (TSM). Further research is needed to examine this relationship...|$|E

F 2 -Isoprostane levels had an independent positive association with estradiol (β = 0. 02, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 01, 0. 03) and inverse associations with sex hormone-binding globulin and follicle-stimulating hormone (β = − 0. 04, 95 % confidence interval: − 0. 07, − 0. 003; β = − 0. 02, 95 % confidence interval: − 0. 03, − 0. 002, respectively) after adjustment for age, race, age at menarche, γ-tocopherol, beta-carotene, total cholesterol, and homocysteine by inverse probability weighting.

However, the combined impact of corre-lated exposure measurement error, unmeasured confounding, interaction, {{and limits of}} detection (LODs) on in-ference for multiple biomarkers is unknown. We conducted data-driven simulations evaluating bias from correlated measurement error with varying reliability coefficients (R), odds ratios (ORs), levels of correlation between exposures and error, LODs, and interactions. Blood cadmium and lead levels in relation to anovulation served as the motivating example, based on findings from the <b>BioCycle</b> Study (2005 – 2007). For most scenarios, main-effect estimates for cadmium and lead with increasing levels of positively correlated measurement error created increasing downward or upward bias for OR> 1. 00 and OR < 1. 00, respectively, that was also a function of effect size. Some scenarios showed bias for cadmium away from the null. Results subject to LODs were similar. Bias for main and interaction effects ranged from − 130 % to 36 % and from − 144 % to 84 %, respectively.

We investigated whether habitual low isoflavone intake among premenopausal women was associated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, a commonly used biomarker associated with prediction of cardiovascular disease risk in healthy women. Between 2005 and 2007, 259 healthy, regularly menstruating womenwere enrolled in the <b>BioCycle</b> Study, and followed for up to 2 menstrual cycles. CRP was measured in serum at up to 16 clinic visits, timed to phases of the womens menstrual cycle. Diet was assessed up to 4 times per cycle by using 24 -h recalls. Marginal structural models with inverse probability of exposure weights estimated the association between CRP and quartiles of isoflavone intake adjusted for age, race, BMI, cycle phase, total energy intake, total fiber, total whole grains, and phase-specific hormone concentrations including estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Compared with the lowest quartile of total isoflavone intake, women in the highest quartile had, on average, 27 % lower serum CRP concentrations (95 % CI: – 35, – 21 %). Our results suggest that dietary isoflavone intakes at levels characteristic of the U.

40|$|The {{circular}} economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency {{by eliminating the}} concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a <b>biocycle</b> (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3 D printing (3 DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability {{and the creation of}} a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3 DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3 DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3 DP to achieve a CE.

40|$|Background: High-fiber diets {{have been}} {{associated}} with decreased breast cancer risk, likely mediated by the effect of fiber on lowering circulating estrogen concentrations. The influence of fiber on as-pects of reproduction, which include ovulation, has not been well studied in premenopausal women. Objective: The objective was to determine if fiber consumption is associated with hormone concentrations and incident anovulation in healthy, regularly menstruating women. Design: The <b>BioCycle</b> Study was a prospective cohort study con-ducted from 2004 to 2006 that followed 250 women aged 18 – 44 y for 2 cycles. Dietary fiber consumption was assessed 4 times/cycle by using 24 -h recall. Outcomes included concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which were measured 8 times/cycle, and incident anovulation. Results: Dietary fiber consumption was inversely associated with hormone concentrations (estradiol, progesterone, LH, and FSH; P, 0. 05) and positively associated with the risk of anovulation (P = 0. 003) by using random-effects models with adjustment for total calories, age, race, and vitamin E intake. Each 5 -g/d increase in total fiber intake was associated with a 1. 78 -fold increased risk (95 % CI: 1. 11, 2. 84) of an anovulatory cycle. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 5 g fruit fiber/d was 3. 05 (95 % CI: 1. 07, 8. 71). Conclusions: These findings suggest that a diet high in fiber is significantly associated with decreased hormone concentrations and a higher probability of anovulation. Further study of the effect of fiber on reproductive health and of the effect of these intakes in reproductive-aged women is warranted. Am J Clin Nutr doi: 10. 3945 /ajcn. 2009. 27990...|$|E
40|$|In premenopausal women, {{elevated}} C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations {{have been}} associated with an increased risk of negative reproductive outcomes. Whole grain consumption has been associated with lower CRP concentrations in older women; however, less is known about this relationship in younger women. We investigated whether whole grain intake was associated with serum high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) concentrations in young women. <b>BioCycle</b> was a prospective cohort study conducted at the University of Buffalo from 2005 to 2007, which followed 259 healthy women aged 18 – 44 y for le 2 menstrual cycles. hs-CRP concentrations were measured longitudinally le 8 times/cycle with visits standardized to menstrual cycle phase. Whole grain intake was estimated by 24 -h recalls le 4 times/cycle. Servings were defined as 16 g or 125 mL of a 100 % whole grain food. Whole grain intake was inversely associated with hs-CRP concentrations after adjusting for age, race, BMI, illness, and antiinflammatory drug use. Consumers of between 0 and 1 serving/d of whole grains had, on average, 11. 5 % lower hs-CRP concentrations (P = 0. 02) and consumers of ge 1 serving/d had 12. 3 % lower hs-CRP concentrations (P = 0. 02) compared with nonconsumers. Women who consumed ge 1 serving/d of whole grain had a lower probability of having moderate (P = 0. 008) or elevated (P = 0. 001) hs-CRP according to the AHA criteria compared with nonconsumers. Given that elevated concentrations of hs-CRP have been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes and pregnancy complications, interventions targeting whole grain consumption may have the potential to improve health status among young women...|$|E
40|$|Missing {{data are}} a common problem in {{virtually}} all epidemiological research, especially when conducting longitudinal studies. In these settings, clinicians may collect biological samples to analyze changes in biomarkers, which often {{do not conform to}} parametric distributions and may be censored due to limits of detection. Using complete data from the <b>BioCycle</b> Study (2005 - 2007), which followed 259 premenopausal women over two menstrual cycles, we compared four techniques for handling missing biomarker data with non-Normal distributions. We imposed increasing degrees of missing data on two non-Normally distributed biomarkers under conditions of missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. Generalized estimating equations were used to obtain estimates from complete case analysis, multiple imputation using joint modeling, multiple imputation using chained equations, and multiple imputation using chained equations and predictive mean matching on Day 2, Day 13 and Day 14 of a standardized 28 -day menstrual cycle. Estimates were compared against those obtained from analysis of the completely observed biomarker data. All techniques performed comparably when applied to a Normally distributed biomarker. Multiple imputation using joint modeling and multiple imputation using chained equations produced similar estimates across all types and degrees of missingness for each biomarker. Multiple imputation using chained equations and predictive mean matching consistently deviated from both the complete data estimates and the other missing data techniques when applied to a biomarker with a bimodal distribution. When addressing missing biomarker data in longitudinal studies, special attention should be given to the underlying distribution of the missing variable. As biomarkers become increasingly Normal, the amount of missing data tolerable while still obtaining accurate estimates may also increase when data are missing at random. Future studies are necessary to assess these techniques under more elaborate missingness mechanisms and to explore interactions between biomarkers for improved imputation models...|$|E
40|$|Folic acid is {{recommended}} to reproductive-aged women to prevent birth defects, though {{little is known}} about the effects of dietary intake on other reproductive outcomes. Improved pregnancy rates have been documented after folic acid supplement use, suggesting a possible link with ovulation, however research is limited. Our objective was to evaluate the association between dietary folate intake, hormone levels, and sporadic anovulation in healthy, regularly menstruating women. The <b>BioCycle</b> study (2005 - 2007) prospectively followed 259 healthy women aged 18 - 44 years from the western New York region for up to 2 menstrual cycles. Total folate and specific sources of folate were assessed up to 4 times per cycle by 24 -hour recall. Estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were measured in serum up to 8 times per cycle, timed using fertility monitors. Anovulation was defined as a cycle with peak progesterone concentration ≤ 5 ng/mL and no LH peak in the mid/late luteal phase. Higher intake of dietary folate (in dietary equivalents) across tertiles had a marginally significant association with greater luteal progesterone levels (P trend 0. 08). Higher intake of synthetic folate was significantly associated with higher luteal progesterone levels (P trend 0. 05). Specifically, women in the 3 (rd) tertile of synthetic folate intake had, on average, 16. 0 % (95 % CI, 0. 5 - 33. 8 %) higher luteal progesterone levels compared to women in the 1 (st) tertile. Moreover, consumption of synthetic folate was significantly and inversely associated with anovulation such that women in the 3 (rd) tertile had a 64 % (95 % CI, 8 - 86 %) decreased odds of anovulation compared to the women in the 1 (st) tertile (P trend 0. 03). These findings suggest that a diet high in synthetic folate may be associated with increased progesterone levels and lower risk of sporadic anovulation. Further study of the effect of dietary folate and folic acid supplement use on reproductive health is warranted...|$|E

40|$|Background: Emerging {{evidence}} suggests potential links between some dietary fatty acids and improved fertility, because specific fatty acids may affect prostaglandin synthesis and steroidogenesis. Objective: The {{objective of this}} exploratory study was to evaluate associations between total and specific types of dietary fat intake and 1) hormone concentrations and 2) the risk of sporadic anovulation in a cohort of 259 regularly menstruating women in the <b>BioCycle</b> Study. Design: Endogenous reproductive hormones were measured up to 8 times/cycle for up to 2 cycles, with visits scheduled {{with the use of}} fertility monitors. Dietary intake was assessed with up to four 24 -h recalls/cycle. Linear mixed models and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the associations between dietary fatty acids and both reproductive hormone concentrations and ovulatory status. All models were adjusted for total energy intake, age, body mass index, and race. Results: Relative to the lowest levels of percentage of energy from total fat, the highest tertile was associated with increased total and free testosterone concentrations (total: percentage change of 4. 0 %; 95 % CI: 0. 7 %, 7. 3 %; free: percentage change of 4. 1 %; 95 % CI: 0. 5 %, 7. 7 %). In particular, the percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the highest tertile was associated with increases in total and free testosterone (total: percentage change of 3. 7 %; 95 % CI: 0. 6 %, 6. 8 %; free: percentage change of 4. 0 %; 95 % CI: 0. 5 %, 7. 5 %). The PUFA docosapentaenoic acid (22 : 5 n– 3) was not significantly associated with testosterone concentrations (P-trend = 0. 86 in energy substitution models) but was associated with increased progesterone and a reduced risk of anovulation (highest tertile compared with the lowest tertile: RR: 0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 18, 0. 95). Fat intakes were not associated with other reproductive hormone concentrations. Conclusions: These results indicate that total fat intake, and PUFA intake in particular, is associated with very small increases in testosterone concentrations in healthy women and that increased docosapentaenoic acid was associated with a lower risk of anovulation...|$|E
