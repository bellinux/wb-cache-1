[...] This work also discusses potential application of sophorolipids (and their derivatives) as well as the potential for genetic engineering strains to enhance sophorolipid yields. Researchers have focused on optimization of sophorolipid production in submerged fermentation, but some efforts have also investigated the possibility of sophorololipid production using solid state fermentation (SSF). The production process can be significantly impacted by the specific properties of the carbon and oil substrates used; and several inexpensive alternatives to more traditional substrates have been investigated. These potential substrates include: biodiesel by-product streams, waste frying oil, restaurant waste oil, industrial fatty acid residues, mango seed fat, and soybean dark oil. The use of most of these substrates have resulted in lower yields compared to traditional fermentation substrates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{subject of}} chemosystematics has {{provided}} insight to both botanical classification and drug development. However, degrees of subjectivity in botanical classifications and limited {{understanding of the}} evolution of chemical char-acters and their biosynthetic pathways has often hampered such studies. In this review an approach of taking phylogenetic classification into account in evaluating colchicine and related phenethylisoquinoline alkaloids from the family Colchi-caceae will be applied. Following on the trends of utilizing evolutionary reasoning in inferring mechanisms in eg. drug re-sistance in cancer and infections, this will exemplify how thinking about evolution can influence selection of plant mate-rial in drug lead discovery, and how knowledge about phylogenetic relationships may be used to evaluate predicted <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chagas disease, {{caused by}} {{infection}} with Trypanosoma cruzi, {{is an important}} cause of cardiovascular disease. It is increasingly clear that parasite-derived prostaglandins potently modulate host response and disease progression. Here, we report that treatment of experimental T. cruzi infection (Brazil strain) beginning 5 days post infection (dpi) with aspirin (ASA) increased mortality (2 -fold) and parasitemia (12 -fold). However, {{there were no differences}} regarding histopathology or cardiac structure or function. Delayed treatment with ASA (20 mg/kg) beginning 60 dpi did not increase parasitemia or mortality but improved ejection fraction. ASA treatment diminished the profile of parasite- and host-derived circulating prostaglandins in infected mice. To distinguish the effects of ASA on the parasite and host <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathways</b> we infected cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) null mice with the Brazil-strain of T. cruzi.

We report the complete genome {{sequence of the}} Blattabacterium sp. associated with the giant roach Blaberus giganteus. Blattabacterium sp., the obligate flavobacterial endosymbiontof cockroaches and the lower termiteMastotermes darwinien-sis, is implicated in rescuing nitrogenous wastes and processing them into amino acids for the host (4, 8, 12, 15, 16).

40|$|Post-translational {{modification}} of proteins via stringently regulated <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathways</b> extends their range of function. Defects in the post-translational {{modification of}} the dystroglycan (DG) protein are common {{to a variety of}} congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) —including Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), Fukuyama CMD, Muscle-Eye-Brain disease (MEB), and certain types of limb-girdle muscular dystro-phy—and result in the malfunction of DG as an extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor (1). DG is composed of a transmembrane β subunit and a cell-surface α subunit (2). α-DG serves as a receptor for laminin-G domain-containing ECM ligands, including laminin, perlecan, agrin, and neurexin (2), which involves various types of glycosylation of its mucin domain. In particular, phosphorylation at the 6 -position of an O-mannose of the trisaccharide [N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) -β 3 -N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) -β 4 -mannose] produces a branch chain that is ultimately extended with repeating disaccharides [-α 3 -glucuronic acid (GlcA) -β 3 -xylose (Xyl) -] synthesized by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE), enabling α-DG to bind ECM ligands (3, 4). Mutations in several known and putative glycosyltransfer-ases cause DG-related disorders.

40|$|Previously we {{presented}} a simplified procedure for empirically finding metabolites which can reverse significantly the toxicity of antibiotics and other inhibitors of bacteria (Foster and Pittillo, 1953 b). Having surveyed {{a considerable number}} of inhibitors, both antibiotics and synthetics, we have concluded that many inhibitors are apt to have their action reversed by one or more known or unknown (yeast extract) metabolites. Frequently the degree of reversal is very small, but demonstrable. Implicit in such results is the idea that the inhibitor exerts its toxic effect on the susceptible cells through interference with the synthesis or utilization by the cell of the specific reversing metabolite(s). It seemed logical that if two chemically dis-similar inhibitors could be found whose toxicities separately are reversible by one and the same metabolite, the two inhibitors would function synergistically in inhibiting the particular bac-terium. Thus, without any knowledge of the <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathways</b> involved, one would have an empirical approach for potentiation of drug action. Synergistic action would be expected only if the sites of inhibition of the two drugs are different in connection with the particular metabolite. On a chance basis, they are apt to be, and the frequency of synergism demonstrable by this approach bears out that conclusion. In essence, this approach embodies a rationale for some instances of synergistic action and, more particularly, presents a simple procedure whereby deliberate potentiation of an inhibitor reversible by a metabolite might be achieved.

40|$|ABSTRACT Mitochondria of {{the human}} malarial {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum in sexual blood stages (or gametocytes) had been structurally {{different from those of}} asexual blood stages of their life cycle in human host. We report here the existence of mitochondrial heterogeneity based on their characteristics of ultrastructural morphology in the asexual and sexual blood stages of P. falciparum from in vitro continuous cultures. Mitochondria in the sexual stage-parasites were more numerous and contained a greater density of cristae than the organelles in the asexual stage-parasites. It was demonstrated that there were apparent variations in size and appearance of the mitochondria between the male and female parasites of the sexual gametocytic stages. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption of the sexual stage-parasites was relatively low, and it was not different from the asexual blood stage-parasites. However, both stages of the parasites ’ growth and their oxygen consumption were found to be sensitive to atovaquone, cyanide and 5 -fluoroorotate which were inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport system and pyrimidine <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathway,</b> respectively. Therefore, the role of mitochondrial organelles with different morpho-logical properties in the asexual and sexual stages of parasite’s development remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Cancers exhibit altered {{metabolism}} {{characterized by}} increased glucose and glutamine uptake. The hexosamine <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathway</b> (HBP) uses glucose and glutamine, and directly contributes to O-linked-b-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modifications on intracellular proteins. Multiple tumor types contain elevated total O-GlcNAcylation, in part, by increasing O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) levels, the enzyme that catalyzes this modification. Although cancer cells require OGT for oncogenesis, {{it is not}} clear how tumor cells regulate OGT expression and O-GlcNAcylation. Here, it is shown that the PI 3 K–mTOR–MYC signaling pathway is required for ele-vation of OGT and O-GlcNAcylation in breast cancer cells. Treatment with PI 3 K and mTOR inhibitors reduced OGT pro-tein expression and decreased levels of overall O-GlcNAcyla-tion. In addition, both AKT and mTOR activation is sufficient to elevate OGT/O-GlcNAcylation. Downstream of mTOR, the oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC is required and sufficient for increased OGT protein expression in an RNA-independent manner and c-MYC regulation of OGT mechanistically requires the expression of c-MYC transcriptional target HSP 90 A. Finally, mammary tumor epithelial cells derived from MMTV-c-myc transgenic mice contain elevated OGT and O-GlcNAcylation and OGT inhibition in this model induces apoptosis. Thus, OGT and O-GlcNAcylation levels are elevated via activation of an mTOR/MYC cascade. Implications: Evidence indicates OGT as a therapeutic target in c-MYC–amplified cancers.

40|$|AbstractPorphyrias are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} or acquired disorders of certain enzymes in the heme <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathway.</b> Most porphyria symptoms are nonspecific and occur intermittently; resulting frequently in missed diagnosis since the disease itself is a rare one. The aim {{of the study is}} to establish a new reliable and accurate laboratory method for separation, identification and quantitation of urinary porphyrins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and thereby the diagnosis of different porphyria types {{for the first time in}} Egypt. Screening by plasma fluorescence and quantitative determination of urinary porphyrins by high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI/MS/MS) of 50 clinically suspected patients revealed one case of variegate porphyria and five cases of porphyria cutanea tarda. Plasma fluorescence scanning is a simple procedure that can be used as screening test to detect porphyria patients that require quantitation of urinary porphyrins as a second step. Quantitative determination of urinary porphyrins using HPLC/ESI/MS/MS and ion mapping techniques are applicable for the differential diagnosis of porphyria types, since each type has a characteristic porphyrins excretion profile. Quantitative determination of urinary porphyrins by HPLC/ESI/MS/MS used in this study is a modification for the method Stoev et al. while ion mapping technique is a new technique invented by the research team at the Biochemical Genetics Department...|$|E
40|$|The endosomal network acts as {{a master}} co-ordinator of traffic from both endocytic and <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathways.</b> A vast {{multitude}} of cargoes are sorted within this system destined for distinct intra- cellular locations. The targeted and efficient distribution of endosomal cargo is reliant upon interactions with protein containing sorting machineries. Sorting machineries have evolved modular domains that associate with defining composites and morphologies of endosomal membranes that assure for correct steady state localisation and therefore function. The Sorting Nexins (SNXs) are a family of proteins characterised {{by the presence of}} a phosphoinositide-binding motif, termed the SNX- PX domain. By virtue of this domain, SNXs associate with membranes of the endocytic network and from here co-ordinate control over endocytosis, endosomal sorting and endosomal signalling. Two sub-families of SNXs are conjugated to additional modular domains, which confer to them diverse functionalities. In this thesis I have examined and characterised the mechanistic details of how SNX 8 and SNX 15 co-ordinate distinct events in endosomal trafficking. SNX 8 utilises co-incidence detection to localise to high-curvature, phosphoinositide-enriched sub-domains of maturing endosomes; from here SNX 8 co-ordinates the production of cargo-enriched carriers that are spatially distinct from more other well characterised tubular exit sites. By recruiting additional sorting machineries, SNX 8 carriers are able to undergo long-range transport events, culminating in recognition and ultimately fusion with a recipient compartment, the Golgi apparatus, to facilitate cargo delivery. SNX 15 associates with recently. endocytosed carriers, throuqh a direct association with clathrin, and facilitates their directional movement away from the cell periphery into the endo-Iysosomal degradative pathway.

40|$|Summary Anticipated {{effects of}} climate change involve complex {{interactions}} in the field. To assess the effects of springtime warming, ambient ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) and nitrogen fertilization on the foliar chemistry and herbivore activity of native sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seed-lings, we carried out a field experiment for 2 years at two sugar maple forests growing on soils of contrasting acidity. At the Ol-iver site, soils are derived from a strongly calcareous till, whereas the naturally acidic soils and base-poor soils of the Haliburton site are derived from the largely granitic Precam-brian Shield. At both sites, removal of ambient UV-B led to in-creases in chlorogenic acid and some flavonoids and reduced herbivore activity. At Haliburton, ammonium nitrate fertiliza-tion led to further increases in foliar manganese (Mn), whereas at Oliver there were no such changes. Nitrogen additions led to decreases in the concentrations of some flavonoids at both sites, but seedlings at Oliver had significantly higher concen-trations of flavonoids and chlorogenic acid than seedlings at Haliburton. We suggest that this could be associated with in-creased mobilization of Mn due to increased soil acidity, which interferes with the role of calcium (Ca) in the phenolic <b>bio-synthetic</b> <b>pathway.</b> It appears that the composition of the forest soil governs the response of seedlings when they are exposed to abiotic stressors...|$|E
