5|$|Expecting to die soon, Agârbiceanu {{worked on}} a {{definitive}} corpus of his writings, which began printing at the state-run Editura pentru Literatură {{under the care of}} G. Pienescu and Mihai Șora. When he was led to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of his works would not be allowed for publishing, he retook possession of all the manuscripts he had sent in, including some previously unpublished writings. The volumes were already available by that time. The writer died in Cluj in 1963, and was buried in the city's Hajongard Cemetery in a grave topped by a white marble cross.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E

500|$|Du Bois {{frequently}} promoted African-American artistic {{creativity in}} his writings, {{and when the}} Harlem Renaissance emerged in the mid-1920s, his article [...] "A Negro Art Renaissance" [...] celebrated {{the end of the}} long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors.Horne, Malika, [...] "Art and Artists", in Young, pp. 13–15.Lewis, p. 475 (article). His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> whites visited Harlem for voyeurism, not for genuine appreciation of black art.Lewis, p. 480. Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that [...] "a black artist is first of all a black artist." [...] He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying [...] "I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda." [...] By the end of 1926, he stopped employing The Crisis to support the arts.|$|E

500|$|Rossio and Marsilii <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are {{a direct result of}} Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem like it has many unforgivable plot holes, when it should not have had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a lot for a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Height of Land Portage {{may have}} had its origin as a route for {{foraging}} or migrating animals. [...] Historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> portages started as animal tracks, and were later used by the early inhabitants of the area. [...] Prior to the Contact Period (when peoples of the First Nations first encountered European explorers), those natives had long used birchbark canoes as the principal means of travel in the thick boreal forest of the Quetico-Superior area. [...] The Height of Land Portage likely was used by those peoples.|$|E

2500|$|Kiefer and Sekaquaptewa {{proposed}} that {{a source of}} some women's underperformance and lowered perseverance in mathematical fields is these women's underlying [...] "implicit" [...] sex-based stereotypes regarding mathematical ability and association, {{as well as their}} identification with their gender. Some psychologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> historical and current sex differences in mathematics performance may be related to boys' higher likelihood of receiving math encouragement than girls. Parents were, and sometimes still are, more likely to consider a son's mathematical achievement as being a natural skill while a daughter's mathematical achievement {{is more likely to be}} seen as something she studied hard for. This difference in attitude may contribute to girls and women being discouraged from further involvement in mathematics-related subjects and careers.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] This {{has to do with a}} distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] This is how it was summed up in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{promotion}} {{was considered}} to be very successful. Rosen noted that they considered the million-dollar goal as a best-case scenario, but once the sale actually started, [...] "it was immediately clear that we were on to something". Rosen would later attribute part of the success to Ars Technica writer Mike Thomspon, stating that he [...] "immediately saw the potential" [...] of the Bundle in an article written for the website just prior to the Bundle's sale period. Brandon Boyer of Boing Boing believed that it provided a model that [...] "seems it could and should be repeated". The move to offer games in a price and manner that consumers were willing to buy was contrasted to larger software publishers that place artificial limitations on their content; Mike Masnick of Techdirt believed the Humble Bundle promotion worked as it [...] "focus on giving people real reasons to buy, rather than just feeling entitled to define the terms under which they buy and looking for ways to limit those who want to interact with you in a different manner". The source for the promotion's website has been requested of Wolfire by several other groups, according to Rosen; Rosen continues to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> similar charitable sales {{can be seen in the}} future from the Humble Bundle's success. For future Bundles, Rosen desires to include lesser-known titles in contrast to World of Goo and Braid, but has had to already reject some developers' requests to be included in a Bundle, claiming the games' quality may tarnish the Humble Indie Bundle branding. Instead, he believes smaller games with no wide profile and are [...] "legitimately good" [...] would be ideal for inclusion in future Bundles.|$|E
