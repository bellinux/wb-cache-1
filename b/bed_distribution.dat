40|$|Purpose: A {{method is}} {{presented}} to radiobiologically compare sequential (SEQ) and simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) breast radiotherapy. Methods: The method is based on identically prescribed biologically effective dose (iso-BED) which was achieved by different prescribed doses due to different fractionation schemes. It is performed by converting the calculated three-dimensional dose distribution to the corresponding <b>BED</b> <b>distribution</b> taking into consideration the different number of fractions for generic α/β ratios. A cumulative BED volume histogram (BEDVH) is then derived from the <b>BED</b> <b>distribution</b> and is compared for the two delivery schemes. Ten breast cancer patients (4 right-sided and 6 left-sided) were investigated. Two tangential intensity modulated whole breast beams with two other oblique (with different gantry angles) beams for the boost volume were used. The boost and the breast target volumes with either α/β[*]=[*] 10 or 3  Gy, and ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral lungs, heart, and contra-lateral breast as organs at risk (OARs) with α/β[*]=[*] 3  Gy were compared. Results: Based on the BEDVH comparisons, the use of SIB reduced the biological breast mean dose by about 3 %, the ipsi-lateral lung and heart by about 10 %, and contra-lateral breast and lung by about 7 %. Conclusion: BED based comparisons should always be used in comparing plans that have different fraction sizes. SIB schemes are dosimetrically more advantageous than SEQ in breast target volume and OARs for equal prescribed BEDs for breast and boost...|$|E

Evidence to support this claim is however, sparse. This study explored the effectiveness of targeted free <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> strategy in achieving equity in terms of ownership and use of bed nets and also reduction of malaria prevalence among children under-five years of age. MethodsNational malaria indicator survey (MIS) data from Angola, Tanzania and Uganda was used in the analysis.

To determine the current context of public sector {{mental health services}} in terms of staff and <b>bed</b> <b>distribution,</b> and how this corresponds to the population distribution in the province. Method. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, an audit questionnaire was submitted to all public sector mental health facilities. Norms and indicators were calculated at provincial and district level. This article investigates staff and <b>bed</b> <b>distribution</b> only. Results. Results demonstrated that within the province, only three of its seven districts have acute beds above the national baseline norm requirement of 13 / 100 000. The private mental health sector provides approximately {{double the number of}} medium- to long-stay beds available in the public sector. Only two regions have staff/population ratios above the baseline norm of 20 / 100 000. However, there are significant differences in this ratio among specific staff categories. There is an inequitable distribution of resources between the eastern and western regions of the province. When compared with the western regions, the eastern regions have poorer access to mental health facilities, human resources and non-governmental organisations.   Conclusion. Owing to the inequitable distribution of resources, the provincial authorities urgently need to develop an equitable model of service delivery.

40|$|To {{provide an}} {{empirical}} base for bed reallocation {{within a hospital}} planning jurisdiction in Canada, this article proposes a population-based method to measure the distribution of acute care beds for each district and the service load for each hospital. The measure for the <b>bed</b> <b>distribution</b> (BDI) {{is the number of}} beds per 1, 000 age-sex-adjusted number of residents in a district, while the service load of a hospital is measured by the number of persons being served per bed (SPI). The number of beds allocated to each district, or the number of persons served by each hospital, was estimated by applying the hospital service population model, which employs both relevance- and commitment-index methods. The method thus proposed was applied to Alberta data. It appears that both BDI and SPI measures are stable across the variation of methods or data sources, yet sensitive enough to detect changes over the years. Using these indexes, potentially over- or underbedded districts and over- or underloaded hospitals can be identified for further investigation so that possible reallocation of acute care beds among the hospitals may take place...|$|E

40|$|Background: Equitable {{distribution}} of health system resources {{has been a}} serious challenge for long ago among the health policy makers. Conducted studies have mostly ever had emphasis on equality rather than equity. In this paper we have attempted to examine both equality and equity in resources distribution. Method: This is an applied and descriptive study in which we plotted Lorenz and concentration curves to describe graphically the <b>distribution</b> of hemodialysis <b>beds</b> and nephrologists as two complementary resources in health care in relation to hemodialysis patients. To end this, inequality and inequity were measured by calculating Gini- coefficient, concentration and Robin Hood indices. We used STATA and EXCEL software to calculate indicators. Results: The results showed that inequality was not seen in hemodialysis beds in population level. However, distribu-tion of nephrologists without considering population needs was accompanied {{with some sort of}} inequality. Gini- coefficient for <b>beds</b> and nephrologists <b>distribution</b> in population level was respectively 0. 02 and 0. 38. Hence, calcu-lation of concentration index for <b>distribution</b> of hemodialysis <b>beds</b> and nephrologists with regard to population needs indicated that unlike <b>beds</b> <b>distribution,</b> equity gap between nephrologists distribution against patients distri-bution among the provinces was considerably significant again. Conclusion: Our results imply that although hemodialysis beds in Iran have been distributed in connection with the population need, nephrologists’ distribution {{is not the same as}} hemodialysis beds one and this imbalance in comple-mentary resources, can affect both efficiency and equitable access to services for population...|$|R

Salinity and turbidity gradients apparently regulate kelp <b>bed</b> <b>distribution</b> {{throughout this}} estuary. The beds are large {{at the entrance}} of the bay, only solitary stands occur in the inner bay, and no kelp is found {{at the head of the}} bay. The role of salinity and turbidity on Nereocystis sporophyte growth was investigated by performing reciprocal transplants among three beds along the bay axis and regularly measuring stipe growth. The effects of salinity and light on spores were studied in the laboratory by recording sinking tendency, settlement success, germination success, and germ tube length under different salinity and light levels. Grazing effects of Lacuna vincta impacted the survival of Nereocystis transplants in-situ and on plants of different age classes in the laboratory. Overall, this study suggests a possible negative estuarine effect on sporophytes transplanted from the outer to the inner bay and on certain aspects of spore development. Herbivory pressure had significant localized effects on Nereocystis survival and was most pronounced on juvenile plants. The dynamics of Nereocystis kelp beds in Kachemak Bay results from large-scale environmental factors and local-scale biological processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We examined, over 2 years, factors {{affecting}} the temporal {{stability of the}} lower limit of kelp beds (Alaria esculenta) at five subtidal sites in the Mingan Islands, northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. The position of the lower limit of the beds varied markedly among sites and over time and was largely controlled by the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, which formed dense (up to 500 individuals m) 2) feed-ing fronts at the lower edge of the beds. These aggregations advanced over the kelp most rapidly during the summer (at rates as high as 2. 5 m month) 1), and {{there appeared to be}} a threshold urchin biomass of 5 kg m) 2 below which the fronts could not substantially reduce the limit of the beds. The fronts consisted mainly of large individuals, whereas smaller urchins predominated in the barrens zone be-low the kelp beds. At one site, we recorded large seasonal shifts in overall urchin densities, with large increases and decreases during the summer and winter, respectively. An urchin exclusion experiment indicated that algal recruitment in the barrens was two orders of magnitude greater in the absence than in the presence of urchins. The kelp Agarum cribrosum greatly re-stricted urchin movements, and the greater temporal stability of the kelp bed at one site appeared related to the gradual replacement of Alaria esculenta in the lower kelp bed by a large stand of Agarum cribrosum. We propose that perturbations by abiotic factors (e. g., ice scouring and water motion) trigger important but localized changes in urchin densities that, in turn, largely determine the limits of kelp <b>bed</b> <b>distribution</b> in this region of the Atlantic where urchin barrens are a persistent community state...|$|E
40|$|Submarine lobes {{are high}} aspect ratio sand-rich {{deposits}} fed by sediment gravity flows via channels. They {{are a major}} component of submarine fans, the largest depositional bodies on the planet, and therefore represent an important archive of palaeo-environmental change. Basin-floor, or terminal, lobes, are well-studied. Here, lobes in other geographical positions and the influence of confinement (especially when subtle and dynamic) and stratigraphic position on submarine lobe geometry, stacking patterns, and sedimentary facies are investigated. Extensive outcrop exposures and near-outcrop research boreholes from Permian fine-grained basin-floor and intraslope lobes in the Karoo Basin (South Africa) allow spatial and stratigraphic variability in sedimentary facies and architecture to be constrained. One hundred and seventy outcrop logs (6. 9 km total length) and 11 core logs (1 km) from Units A and E, Laingsburg depocentre and Fan 4, Tanqua depocentre, were integrated to enable the analysis of different lobe types within a physical hierarchy and enabled detailed facies distribution trends, stacking patterns and depositional models to be established. The main outcomes of the study are: 1) recognition criteria for three distinctive lobe fringe settings: frontal, lateral and aggradational lobe fringes; observed differences between frontal and lateral lobe fringe deposits are controlled by flow processes, while aggradational lobe fringes form in response to subtle confinement by intrabasinal slopes; 2) the documentation of lobe stacking patterns within lobe complexes and complex sets. Karoo lobes show a range of stacking patterns that are controlled by seabed topography and sediment supply; 3) the evaluation of hybrid <b>bed</b> <b>distribution</b> that indicates strong geographic but weak stratigraphic trends at different hierarchical scales.

Forty-two studies were identified and reviewed. The results indicate that distribution frameworks varied greatly; and consequently so did outcomes of insecticide-treated bed net use. Studies revealed consistent inequities between urban and rural populations; which were most effectively alleviated through a free insecticide-treated bed net delivery and distribution framework. However, cost sharing through subsidies was shown to increase programme sustainability, which may lead to more long-term coverage.

40|$|Abstract. In Africa anopheline {{mosquitoes}} transmit malaria and {{lymphatic filariasis}} (LF); insecticide-treated bed nets significantly reduce transmission of both. Insecticide-treated bed net provision to children under 5 (U 5) and pregnant women (PW) {{is a major}} goal of malaria control initiatives, but use in Africa remains low because of cost and logistics. We therefore integrated insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> with the 2004 LF/onchocerciasis mass drug administration (MDA) program in Central Nigeria. Community volunteers distributed 38, 600 insecticide-treated bed nets, while simultaneously treating 150, 800 persons with ivermectin/albendazole (compared with 135, 600 in 2003). This was subsequently assessed with a 30 -cluster survey. Among surveyed households containing U 5 /PW, 80 % (95 % CI, 72 – 87 %) owned 1 insecticide-treated bed net, a 9 -fold increase from 2003. This first linkage of insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> with mass drug administration resulted in substantial improvement in insecticide-treated bed net own-ership and usage, without adversely affecting mass drug administration coverage.

The analysis is conducted with the aid of data collected in a large-amplitude meandering flume during a reference experiment without vegetation and an experiment with vegetation on the bed. The results show that the presence of vegetation modifies the curvature-induced flow pattern and the directionality of turbulent structures. In fact, in the presence of vegetation, the turbulent structures tend to develop within and between the vegetated elements.

Low thermal capacity should also allow rapid response to load changes. This thesis describes investigations {{of the validity of}} these potential virtues. Experiments, at atmospheric pressure, were conducted in flow visualisation rigs and a combustor designed to accommodate a distributor 200 mm diameter and 80 mm axial length. Ancillary experiments were conducted in a 6 " diameter conventional fluidised bed. The investigations encompassed assessment of; fluidisation and elutriation, coal feed requirements, start-up and steady-state combustion using premixed propane and air, transition from propane to coal combustion and mechanical design. Assessments were made of an elutriation model and some effects of particle size on the combustion of premixed fuel gas and air. The findings were: a) more reliable start-up and control methods must be developed. Combustion of premixed propane and air led to severe mechanical and operating problems. Manual control of coal combustion was inadequate. b) Design criteria must encompass pressure loss, mechanical strength and high temperature resistance. The flow characteristics of ancillaries and the distributor must be matcheo. c) Fluidisation of a range of particle sizes was investigated. New correlations for minimum fluidisation and fully supported velocities are proposed. Some effects on elutriation of particle size and the distance between the bed surface and exhaust port have been identified. A conic distributor did not aid initial <b>bed</b> <b>distribution.</b> Furthermore, airflow instability was encountered with this distributor shape. Future use of conic distributors is not recommended. Axial solids mixing was found to be poor. A coal feeder was developed which produced uniform fuel distribution throughout the bed.

40|$|Radioactive seed implant {{brachytherapy}} is {{a common}} radiotherapy treatment method for prostate cancer. In current clinical practice, a seed consists of a single isotope, such as 125 I or 103 Pd. A seed containing a mixture of two isotopes has been proposed for prostate cancer treatment. This study investigates a method for defining a prescription dose for new seed compositions based on matching the biological equivalent dose (BED) of a reference plan. Ten prostate cancer cases previously treated using single isotope seeds (5 using 125 I seeds and 5 using 103 Pd seeds) were selected for this study. Verification of the method was done by calculating prescription doses for 103 Pd and 125 I seeds. A prescription dose for a 50 / 50 hybrid seed was calculated. Number and location of seeds remained invariant within each case. The BED distributions for hybrid and single isotope seed plans were generated and matched to the <b>BED</b> <b>distribution</b> generated off of the optimized plans. For the 125 I isotopes, the dose necessary to cover 90 % of the prostate with a BED of 110 Gy is 145 Gy. For the same BED coverage, the dose for 103 Pd and 50 / 50 hybrid seed is 120 Gy and 137 Gy respectively. A method is introduced for obtaining prescription doses for new brachytherapy sources. The method was verified by obtaining doses for 125 I and 103 Pd isotopes which match clinical prescription doses. The method developed is robust enough to calculate prescription doses in any region of interest, for any seed type, and for any isotope {{as long as the}} BED coverage remains invariant with respect to the treatment plan. Numerical calculations were performed to derive analytical conversions of total dose to BED for 50 / 50, 75 / 25 and 25 / 75 hybrid seeds. These analytical conversions are faster than the original numerical methods employed allowing for real-time BED optimization for hybrid seeds. Varying seed distribution was seen not to influence the analytical conversions. It was observed that when total dose remained invariant while individual isotope contributions varied, the value of BED varied. The BED variance was seen to be the smaller at larger BED values (~ 2 % at 100 Gy). Using the conversions derived in this paper, BED based optimization for hybrid seeds are now performable. However, these conversions should only be used in high dose regions due to high uncertainty in the low regime...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Intraoperative Avidination for Radionuclide Therapy (IARTÂ®) {{is a novel}} {{targeted}} {{radionuclide therapy}} recently used in patients with early breast cancer. It is a radionuclide approach with 90 Y-biotin combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to release a boost of radiation in the tumour bed. Two previous clinical trials using dosimetry based on the calculation of mean absorbed dose values with the hypothesis of uniform activity distribution (MIRD 16 method) assessed the feasibility and safety of IARTÂ®. In the present retrospective study, a voxel dosimetry analysis was performed to investigate heterogeneity in distribution of the absorbed dose. The aim of this work was to compare dosimetric and radiobiological evaluations derived from average absorbed dose vs. voxel absorbed dose approaches. Methods We evaluated 14 patients who were injected with avidin into the tumour bed after conservative surgery and 1 day later received an intravenous injection of 3. 7 GBq of 90 Y-biotin (together with 185 MBq 111 In-biotin for imaging). Sequential images were used to estimate the absorbed dose in the target region according to the standard dosimetry method (SDM) and the voxel dosimetry method (VDM). The biologically effective dose (<b>BED)</b> <b>distribution</b> was also evaluated. Dose/volume and BED volume histograms were generated to derive equivalent uniform BED (EUBED) and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values. Results No "cold spots" were highlighted by voxel dosimetry. The median absorbed-dose in the target region was 20 Gy (range 15 - 27 Gy) by SDM, and the median EUD was 20. 4 Gy (range 16. 5 - 29. 4 Gy) by the VDM; SDM and VDM estimates differed by about 6 %. The EUD/mean voxel absorbed dose ratio was > 0. 9 in all patients, indicative of acceptable uniformity in the target. The median BED and EUBED values were 21. 8 Gy (range 15. 9 - 29. 3 Gy) and 22. 8 Gy (range 17. 3 - 31. 8 Gy), respectively. Conclusion VDM highlighted the absence of significant heterogeneity in absorbed dose in the target. The EUD/ mean absorbed dose ratio indicated a biological efficacy {{comparable to that of}} uniform distribution of absorbed dose. The VDM is recommended for improving accuracy, taking into account actual activity distribution in the target region.

It was also the aim to perform supplementary thermodynamic equilibrium calculations {{in order to support}} the experimental results. The base fuel used was either wood or bark pellets and the additional fuels included municipal sewage sludge, sludge from the pulp and paper industry and demolition wood. In some of the tests, additives were supplied to the boiler to enhance any effects from substances of special interest. Examples of such additives are zinc oxide, PVC, ammonium sulphate, kaolin and zeolites. The 12 MWth circulating fluidised bed boiler situated at Chalmers University of Technology was central to the investigation. All combustion tests were performed in this boiler and it provided operating data, flue gas composition and samples of fuel, ash and deposits under required combustion conditions. Great effort was put into the analyses of ashes and deposits and in excess of conventional techniques, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS), scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x-ray (SEM EDX) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were applied to several of the samples to create a more complete scan of the constituents. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed using the computer program FactSage and the module EQUILIB. The thermodynamic data was collected from the database FACT. The focus of the investigation was directed towards three main areas: sulphur capture performance by lime addition to the <b>bed,</b> <b>distribution</b> of heavy metals in ashes and flue gas, and formation of deposits on heat transfer surfaces in the convective pass and the use of municipal sewage sludge as a preventive additive. The relatively high content of phosphorus in municipal sewage sludge interferes with the sulphur capture by lime and decreases the sulphur capture performance. Phosphorus reacts with calcium, which otherwise is available for reaction with sulphur, and forms compounds such as calcium phosphates. The formation was supported by equilibrium calculations and proved by analysing the ashes with TOF-SIMS. The decreased lime efficiency {{must be taken into account}} when sulphur capture strategies are decided for the reduction of SO 2 emissions from co-combustion of municipal sewage sludge. Further, the use of bark pellets as base fuel during co-combustion with sulphur containing wastes reduces the sulphur emissions due to their relatively high content of calcium and potassium in connection with its low content of sulphur. The supply of heavy metals to the combustion increases dramatically when wood is replaced by municipal sewage sludge under otherwise constant conditions. The heavy metals are to a large extent recovered in the ash and captured by the flue gas cleaning system. Even the most volatile species, such as mercury, are captured and enriched in the fine fly ash. The effective metal capture is partly due to the sludge ash and partly to the bag filter. The amount of ash in the boiler increases with the sludge and the fine fly ash fraction constitutes a high particle surface area which enhances the capture of volatile metals. Further, the ash contains large amounts of several elements known to retain trace elements such as aluminium, calcium, carbon and silicon. Especially the presence of zeolites in the sludge is likely to contribute to the capture of mercury. Further, the enrichment ratios of metals in the filter ash indicate the necessity of including bag-filters in the flue gas cleaning system in order to achieve sufficient removal of toxic heavy metals. Zinc, and its effect on deposit formation, was given special attention since the metal is commonly present in demolition wood. The result showed that combustion of demolition wood contaminated with zinc alone generates only a modest amount of deposits. Demolition wood contaminated with both zinc and chlorine gives rise to more severe deposit formation. The main reason for this is the formation of alkali chlorides but also zinc chlorides in the flue gas. The formation of zinc chlorides is, under reducing conditions, thermodynamically favoured between 450 and 850 °C. Under oxidising conditions, the formation is initiated at 400 °C and gradually increased with the temperature. Municipal sewage sludge is not only a waste that must be disposed of, it can also be regarded as an additive to prevent deposit formation during combustion of high alkali biomass. The sludge reduces the concentration of KCl in the flue gas, impedes the deposit formation and eliminates the content of chlorine in the deposits. The occurrence is clear of though the fuel is contaminated with chlorine. The effect is partly due to sulphation of potassium and partly to potassium sequestration by the sludge ash...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of {{nonuniform}} dose distribution within lesions and tumor-involved organs of patients receiving Zevalin(®), and to discuss possible implications of equivalent uniform biological effective doses (EU-BED) on treatment efficacy and toxicity. MATLAB™ -based software for voxel-based dosimetry was adopted for this purpose. Methods: Eleven lesions from seven patients with either indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma were analyzed, along with four organs with disease. Absorbed doses were estimated by a direct integration of single-voxel kinetic data from serial tomographic images. After proper corrections, differential <b>BED</b> <b>distributions</b> and surviving cell fractions were estimated, allowing for the calculation of EU-BED. To quantify dose uniformity in each target area, a heterogeneity index was defined. Results: Average doses were below those prescribed by conventional radiotherapy to eradicate lymphoma lesions. Dose heterogeneity and effect on tumor control varied among lesions, with no apparent relation to tumor mass. Although radiation doses to involved organs were safe, unexpected liver toxicity occurred in one patient who presented with a pattern of diffuse infiltration. Conclusion: Voxel-based dosimetry and radiobiologic modeling can be successfully applied to lesions and tumor-involved organs, representing a methodological advance over estimation of mean absorbed doses. However, effects on tumor control and organ toxicity still cannot be easily predicted...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} increased funding for malaria control. Malaria experts {{have used the}} opportunity to advocate for rollout of such interventions as free bed nets. A free <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> strategy {{is seen as the}} quickest way to improve coverage of effective malaria control tools especially among poorest communities. Evidence to support this claim is however, sparse. This study explored the effectiveness of targeted free <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> strategy in achieving equity in terms of ownership and use of bed nets and also reduction of malaria prevalence among children under-five years of age. National malaria indicator survey (MIS) data from Angola, Tanzania and Uganda was used in the analysis. Hierarchical multilevel logistic regression models were used to analyse the relationship between variables of interest. Outcome variables were defined as: childhood test-confirmed malaria infections, household ownership of any mosquito net and children's use of any mosquito nets. Marginal effects of having free <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> on households with different wealth status were calculated. Angolan children from wealthier households were 6. 4 percentage points less likely to be parasitaemic than those in poorest households, whereas those from Tanzania and Uganda were less likely to test malaria positive by 7 and 11. 6 percentage points respectively (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The study estimates and present results on the marginal effects based on the impact of free <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> on children's malaria status given their socio-economic background. Poorest households were less likely to own a net by 21. 4 % in Tanzania, and 2. 8 % in Uganda, whereas both poorer and wealthier Angolan households almost achieved parity in bed net ownership (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Wealthier households had a higher margin of using nets than poorest people in both Tanzania and Uganda by 11. 4 % and 3. 9 % respectively. However, the poorest household in Angola had a 6. 1 % net use advantage over children in wealthier households (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). This is the first study to use nationally representative data to explore inequalities in bed net ownership and related consequences on childhood malaria infection rates across different countries. While targeted <b>distribution</b> of free <b>bed</b> nets improved overall bed net ownership, it did not overcome ownership inequalities as measured by household socioeconomic status. Use of bed nets was disproportionately lower among poorest children, except for Angola where bed net use was higher among poorest households when compared to children in wealthier households. The study highlights the need for malaria control world governing bodies and policy makers to continue working on finding appropriate strategies to improve access to effective malaria control tools especially by the poorest who often times bears the brunt of malaria burden than their wealthier counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaria is {{the leading}} cause of death in Mozambique in {{children}} under five years old. In 2009, Mozambique developed a novel <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> model to increase coverage, based on assumptions about sleeping patterns. The coverage and impact of a <b>bed</b> net <b>distribution</b> campaign using this model in four districts in Sofala Province, Mozambique was evaluated. Methods: Paired household, cross-sectional surveys were conducted one month after the 2010 distribution of 140, 000 bed nets and again 14 months after the campaign in 2011. During household visits, malaria blood smears were performed and haemoglobin levels were assessed on children under five and data on bed net ownership, access and use were collected; these indicators were analysed at individual, household and community levels. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of malaria infection and anaemia. Results: The campaign reached 98 % (95 % CI: 97 - 99 %) of households registered during the precampaign listing, with 81 % (95 % CI: 77 - 85 %) of sleeping spaces covered by campaign bed nets and 85 % (95 % CI: 81 - 88 %) of the population sleeping in a sleeping space with a campaign bed net designated for the sleeping space. One year after the campaign, 65 % (95 % CI: 57 - 72 %) of sleeping spaces were observed to have hanging bed nets. The proportion of sleeping spaces for which bed nets were reported used four or more times per week was 65 % (95 % CI: 56 - 74 %...|$|R
