40|$|An {{earlier work}} [18] proposes {{a method for}} solving the Lagrangian dual of a {{constrained}} binary quadratic programming problem via quantum adiabatic evolution using an outer approximation method. This should <b>be</b> an <b>efficient</b> prescription for solving the Lagrangian dual problem {{in the presence of}} an ideally noise-free quantum adiabatic system. However, current implementations of quantum annealing systems demand methods that <b>are</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> handling possible <b>sources</b> of noise. In this paper, we consider a subgradient method for finding an optimal primal-dual pair for the Lagrangian dual of a constrained binary polynomial programming problem. We then study the quadratic stable set (QSS) problem as a case study. We see that this method applied to the QSS problem can be viewed as an instance-dependent penalty-term approach that avoids large penalty coefficients. Finally, we report our experimental results of using the D-Wave 2 X quantum annealer and conclude that our approach helps this quantum processor to succeed more often in solving these problems compared to the usual penalty-term approaches...|$|R

The 2 mm spectral range provides a unique terrestrial window enabling ground-based observations of the earliest active dusty galaxies in the universe and thereby allowing a better constraint on the star formation rate in these objects. The optical design incorporates a 100 mm diameter silicon lens cooled to 4 K, which provides the required fast beam yielding 0. 9 lambda/D pixels. With this spatial sampling, GISMO will <b>be</b> very <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> detecting <b>sources</b> serendipitously in large sky surveys, while the capability for diffraction limited imaging is preserved.

The instrument will fill in the spectral energy distribution of high redshift galaxies at the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the dust emission spectrum, even at the highest redshifts. Here 1 will we present early results from our observing run with the first fielded BUG bolometer array. We have developed key technologies to enable highly versatile, kilopixel, infrared through millimeter wavelength bolometer arrays. The Backshort-Under-Grid (BUG) array consists of three components: 1) a transition-edge-sensor (TES) based bolometer array with background-limited sensitivity and high filling factor, 2) a quarter-wave reflective backshort grid providing high optical efficiency, and 3) a superconducting bump-bonded large format Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) multiplexer readout. The array is {{described in more detail}} elsewhere (Allen et al., this conference).

40|$|Groundwater-surface water {{interactions}} (GSWI's) {{interactions are}} an important part of understanding the hydrological cycle, groundwater and river systems, and in providing estimates of groundwater contributions to rivers (base flow). Seepage/leakage of groundwater into surface waters can be measured directly, but this is very labor-intensive, and therefore not feasible at the scale of a basin. An alternative method, which was used in this study, infers groundwater seepage from electrical conductivity and temperature (EC& T) of water at the bottom of the river, based on the assumption that there is a contrast between the incoming groundwater and the river water (which is almost always the case). Zones of groundwater seepage were confirmed and quantified using open-top seepage meters. The results were then used to obtain an integrated baseflow and compared to baseflow found from graphical hydrograph separation techniques. Baseflow estimates, using the two methods, were similar. The methodology in this study proved useful in detecting groundwater seepage, but it <b>was</b> also <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> pinpointing <b>sources</b> of local high EC loading in the river. This can therefore be an extremely valuable tool in the watershed management. The level of detail proved by this method is extremely useful in many GIS-based applications, including the assessment of susceptibility of an aquifer to contamination, the understanding of a river ecosystem, flood protection and control and groundwater modeling exercises...|$|R

Of the other three sources two are undetected at optical wavelengths down {{to the limits of}} very deep Subaru and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope images (∼ 27 mag AB, i band) and the photometry of the remaining source is corrupted by a bright nearby galaxy.

40|$|The 2 mm {{spectral}} range provides a unique terrestrial window enabling ground based {{observations of the}} earliest active dusty galaxies in the universe and thereby allowing a better constraint on the star formation rate in these objects. We present a progress report for our bolometer camera GISMO (the Goddard-IRAM Superconducting 2 -Millimeter Observer), which will obtain large and sensitive sky maps at this wavelength. The instrument will be used at the IRAM 30 m telescope and we expect to install it at the telescope in 2007. The camera uses an 8 x 16 planar array of multiplexed TES bolometers, which incorporates our recently designed Backshort Under Grid (BUG) architecture.

The instrument will fill in the SEDs of high redshift galaxies at the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the dust emission spectrum, even at the highest redshifts.
