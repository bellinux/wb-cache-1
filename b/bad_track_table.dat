In PARIS, the near likely node is stateless, whereas the collector nodes keep a data <b>track</b> <b>table</b> to maintain the data transfer information.

Thereby no flooding messages are needed during data retrieval, and thus reduce the overall communication overhead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Past RoboCup {{competitions}} {{have shown}} the existence of many common problems with vision systems, that lead to <b>bad</b> <b>tracking</b> and loss of objects, causing loss of play time.

A robust and fault tolerant vision system is required, to allow the correct building and testing of better control systems upon it. The use of image processing techniques, together with statistics and a correct knowledge representation are good tools for solving these problems. Our goal is to study and test these techniques in order to contribute with a better vision system. ...|$|R
