We use this recent contribution as a starting point to make a more thorough assessment of the methodology used to measure aid in general, and ODA in particular. The methodology is applied to some typical aid instruments, such as tied technical assistance, concessional loans and debt forgiveness.

40|$|Like most {{developing}} countries, Zambia {{has been}} going through very difficult times economically. This has seriously affected the capacity of various government agencies to provide public services. As a result the government and its agencies have {{over the past decade}} been forced to reassess the way in which publicly provided urban services are delivered. The key policy response has been a movement towards involvement of the private sector in the delivery of urban municipal services. One of the key sectors in which the government of Zambia has been keen to implement policy reform has been the water and sanitation sector. The main thrust of reform has been the creation of Commercial Water Utilities {{in many parts of the}} country.

40|$|Many {{countries}} overhaul {{their tax}} systems {{from time to}} time. In the Asian region countries like Indonesia, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand have all undergone drastic tax reforms in the last 20 years. The need to fill the government coffers, attract foreign investment and make the tax system more equitable are among the factors instigating these tax reforms. Leading politicians, key institutions, external advisers, lobby groups and parliamentarians {{are just a few}} of the actors initiating or setting the tax reform agenda and influencing the actual reform process. But who truly pulls the strings? And how does this process work in countries with non-democratic governments? Is it different from democratic countries? Moreover, many countries have received the invited and sometimes uninvited assistance of advisers of multi- and <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>agencies.</b> The role of these foreign actors is sometimes controversial and it remains unclear what their actual influence is in these reform processes. And how does their role relate to the idea that without ‘local ownership’ most reform projects are doomed to fail (Allott 1980; Walle 2005, pp. 65 - 78). The initial tax law reform may look great on paper, but without local ownership who is going to implement and adhere to the new laws? What happens once foreign advisers have gone home? So who and what truly influences these tax reform processes? That is the key question of this study. The 1980 s corporate and income tax reforms in Indonesia and Vietnam are analysed to find answers to this question. The basis for the analysis is fiscal sociological theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Since 1999, multi- and <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> have {{based their}} {{development}} cooperation with heavily indebted poor {{countries on the}} elaboration of poverty reduction strategy papers that should be ‘country-owned’. This thesis explores this concept of ownership and analyses the power relationships between aid donors and recipient governments involved in efforts to promote ownership. It employs a political sociology perspective and draws on institutional theories and theories of organisational change to argue that ownership is a normative, not an analytical concept. Using the two ‘model recipient’ case studies of Bolivia and Ghana, it analyses two different tools of development cooperation: direct budget support mechanisms and the fostering of civil society participation in national policy-making. It places these two cooperation tools in their socio-political context to investigate in how far informal political processes represent factors that determine national politics, and ultimately the likelihood of success of political reform. The empirical research is centred around 140 qualitative semi-structured interviews with <b>donor</b> <b>agency,</b> governments and civil society representatives in both countries. The dominance of ownership questions in current development debates are explained {{with reference to the}} historical evolution of development cooperation, particularly the structural adjustment programmes of the 1980 s and the criticisms and revisions they evoked. The author argues that two different types of ownership should be distinguished: ‘government’ and ‘national’ ownership. The thesis demonstrates that direct budget support mechanisms are intended to foster government ownership, while the promotion of civil society participation is aimed at fostering national ownership. Donors’ attempt to foster ownership of formalised reform agendas is an almost impossible task because informal political processes largely shape the realm of national politics at the state level and determine the type and degree of societal participation in national policy-making. The thesis concludes by suggesting that international donors, pursuing these policies, risk destabilising representative democratic systems of recipient countries in undesirable ways.

It finds that much of the case for emphasizing the role of NGOs/GROs rests on ideological grounds rather than empirical verification. In addition, though the evidence is inconclusive, there are signs that greater dependence on official funding may compromise NGO/GRO performance in key areas, distort accountability, and weaken legitimacy.

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has been {{considered}} the dominant paradigm in water resources. It is the flagship project of supranational global bodies such as the Global Water Partnership (GWP) and has also been actively promoted by multilateral and regional development banks (e. g. the World Bank; African Development Bank) as well as <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> which make {{it out to be}} the panacea to address the water management crisis in the global south, leading to major water reforms programmes and the rewriting of national policies drawing on IWRM principles in a range of countries in southern Africa. This paper offers a conceptual approach for studying the evolution, spread and uptake of IWRM. It then turns to the actual practices, and how IWRM has been interpreted in multiple ways, and how it aligns with existing patterns of legal pluralism. The paper proposes a conceptual framework that builds on three main themes, the flow of IWRM as an idea in international and national fora, the translation and adoption of IWRM into national contexts, and the practice of IWRM in local contexts. In constructing such a conceptual framework, we draw on several strands of thought, including policy discourse, network and regime theory (flows), translation theory and donor-recipient studies (translation and adoption) and theories of legal pluralism, institutional bricolage and agency (practices). With this framework we hope {{it will be possible to}} trace the spread, transformation and uptake of IWRM across global, national and local scales, to unearth the convergences and divergences in understandings and applications of the notion of IWRM raising challenges and issues for debate and further research and key actors operating at different levels mediating/moderating/articulating the travel of policy ideas. The latter may create generic insights on policy processes and practice that goes beyond the concept of IWRM and the water world. This framework will guide the critical study of various interpretations and challenges of how policy ideas travel at multiple political and geographical scales, from macro political forums to localised arenas and communities, speaking to wider themes such as policy translation and uptake and the politics of the development process...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we assess the IMF {{approach}} to economic reform {{in developing countries}} {{within the context of}} a broader literature on growth and development strategy. The role and impact of the IMF has been evaluated using cross-country regressions; and while some controversy remains, most of these studies conclude that IMF programs have failed in delivering growth. This lack of success is typically ascribed to rigidity in imposing a long list of standard conditionalities. An ongoing debate has also considered how to reform the Washington Consensus policy template using insights which hold that unleashing an economy’s growth potential requires removing key binding constraints. The process of locating binding constraints involves growth diagnostics and policy trialing. We find this approach to be more relevant to governments and to projects and programs supported by <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> and international <b>agencies</b> such as the World Bank. The acclaimed rigidity of the IMF stems more from an adherence to orthodox economic theory and a focus on external balance and macroeconomic stability than from ignoring the specific context of individual countries...|$|R

40|$|NAMA {{liberalisation}} {{alone will}} {{not be sufficient to}} achieve the development goals of the Doha Round. The structure of developing countries' economies and weaknesses in their infrastructure and institutions mean that adjustment to liberalisation is often costly and export responses slow. To make NAMA work, developing countries will need technical and financial support to raise their ability to adapt to greater openness and globalisation pressures and to increase their export capabilities. Although developing countries should decide how to raise their ability to adjust and to increase exports, <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> and multilateral <b>agencies</b> will need to fund NAMA support programmes. The WTO, however, is not the appropriate or competent international agency to provide or disburse such funding. It can provide technical advice and offers a negotiating vehicle for industrial countries to signal that the development aims of the Doha Round are recognised in substantive terms. If industrial countries support developing countries' NAMA-related adjustment costs in addition to offering NAMA tariff cuts, the chances of a successful Doha agreement and genuine pro-development outcomes will be boosted significantly.

40|$|The five {{evaluation}} criteria from the Development Assistance Committee of the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/DAC) {{have been a}} strong foundation for international development evaluation since 1991. They {{have been the most}} prominent and widely adopted criteria used for aid evaluation by most <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>donor</b> <b>agencies,</b> as well as international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). However, critiques of the quality of development aid evaluation are still abundant. Thus, it is reasonable to question how those criteria can be improved. This paper provides a critical look at the five DAC criteria and proposes major recommendations for changes, including revisions of definitions, addition of key missing criteria, and discussions about the level of importance of the criteria. If followed, these changes could contribute for increasing the quality of evaluations for the purposes of (re) funding, program changes, and other decision options. E fforts in the direction of establishing guidelines, standards and/or criteria for improving evaluation practice within the development sector are longstanding trends. 1 The World Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department was certainly one of the pioneers in this area.

40|$|Louk Box et. al. (2003) Review of Science and Technology {{plans in}} ACP countries, University of Maastricht, Maastricht. Chapter 4 & 5 : Discussion and Conclusions Discussion The {{present study was}} a first attempt to review both the {{national}} and regional plans of ACP countries and reports compiled by international and bilateral agencies with regard to S&T policies, particularly those related to agricultural development in ACP countries. Most <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>agencies,</b> such as DFID (UK), AFD (France), DGIS (the Netherlands) and USAID, have supported substantial S&T programmes in the past, particularly in agriculture (see reviews by Gaillard (2000)). It appears that no central data are being kept at this moment (as {{was done in the}} past by SPAAR or the FAO). Policy changes in the late 1990 s do not appear to have had an impact on policies in ACP countries in the period 2000 - 2002. It is also difficult to assess previous trends, because papers published before 2000 {{were not included in the}} present review. Based on the work by Idachaba (1991) it appears that funding for S&T programmes in the 1980 s declined in most ACP countries. Despite some notable exceptions - Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago - the general picture appears one of continued government withdrawal of support for S&T, in particular in the agricultural sector. The rather naïve optimism of the international financial institutions in the 1980 s that the private sector would take over has not materialized in most ACP countries. Regional coordination and donor coordination do not appear to have improved. The reports examined date from 1998 to 2003 (with one exception). Most of them deal with technological innovation systems for agricultural development. Policy plans for ACP countries were reviewed on the basis of the Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) prepared under the Cotonou Agreement. Special attention was paid to studies on agricultural development compiled by agencies such as FARA and the CGIAR. Agriculture plays a minor role in S&T (mentioned in only 8 % of the CSPs), and in the national indicative plans (NIPs) (7 %). This means that agriculture is accorded fairly low priority in most ACP countries, despite its substantial contribution to these countries´ GDP. It was not possible to assess the extent of participation of representatives of the sector, particularly of farmers´ organizations, in the formulation of the policy documents. In some cases, this has occurred (when national policy dialogues have taken place), but it is not clear to what extent farmers´ priorities were transformed into national priorities. The participation of donors in the various plans and policies has been substantial, especially the following cases: The European Commission in the Cape Town Plan of Action: The Commission and the South African Ministry of Science and technology took the initiative in forging a consensus among the participants. Agriculture and agro-industry are key strategic areas. The European Commission through INCO: agriculture is included as one of the main themes, possibly to correct the low priority given to it by ACP governments. The World Bank has for a long time financed various organizations and programmes dealing with agricultural technology. FARA´s Multi-Country Agricultural Productivity Programme (MAPP) focuses on NARS, SROs, IARS and the CGIAR. NEPAD supports biotechnology through NGO cooperation and the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP). Country and regional plans, policies and studies: UNESCO Science Report: Africa (2002) : No specific reference to agriculture. Mugabe (2003) states that R&D in general has a low priority, but is increasing by means of funding. South Africa, Egypt and Zimbabwe are now encouraging biotechnology research. South Africa: role of agriculture in strategic S&T policy is decreasing. Ivory Coast: no agricultural policy indicated. Nigeria: no scientific policy so far. Tanzania has had an agricultural policy since 1989, including agricultural research and technology transfer. Cameroon has a stable research system, but it is defined by external relations and is facing practical problems. Burkina Faso has a well-elaborated science plan, but the system suffers from weak human and material resources. The UNESCO Science Report on Latin America and the Caribbean notes that LAC programmes such as CABBIO, CSST, INCO, COLCYT, and IICA have suffered a period of relative stagnation. CSST: in the strategy papers for the region, agriculture plays an important role. Guyana: agriculture is crucial in the national development plan. Vietnam: Agriculture plays a focal role in S&T policy plans. The participation of the S&T or agriculture sector in the preparation of the Cotonou Agreement varied considerable. In some cases, like Mauritius, the participation of the private sector has been structured. The CSPs generally do not include discussion of participatory methodologies. In a previous study (Demanding Innovation) the policy dialogues in the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda and Vietnam were rather uneven. Earlier inventories of S&T plans of ACP countries undertaken by relevant international agencies were as follows: Gaillard and Waast, funded by the European Commission and the French government. Idachaba through ISNAR and the African Academy of Sciences UNESCO Science Reports on Africa and on Latin America and the Caribbean. Policies and plans on biotechnology in Africa by Mugabe (2002 and 2003). Conclusions The main conclusions to be drawn from this survey of S&T policies in ACP countries are as follows: The Country Strategy Papers indicate that in the ACP countries themselves there is little or no priority for S&T. Agriculture and agricultural S&T do not have the priority that could be expected in view of the importance of agriculture in the economies of ACP countries. Agricultural research and technology development appears to have steadily declined over the 1980 s and 1990 s, reflecting the decreasing donor interest in this subsector. One may therefore wonder to what extent agricultural research and technology development is surviving as a global public good. Multilateral organizations and <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> were probably unable to maintain support for the subsector over the 1990 s, even though many initiatives have been launched. Major donors like the European Union and financial institutions such as the World Bank are likely to become ever more important in the rescue of agricultural research, through programmes like the 6 th Framework Programme (to support agricultural research) and FARA (to coordinate technology development in Africa). The implications for CTA can be summarized as follows: ACP countries themselves do not give priority to agricultural S&T. Any initiative designed to support S&T will need to address this reality. The EU is in a rapid process of change. The earlier emphasis on S&T for development has given way to other priorities, especially in DG Development. DG Research has made a valiant effort to rescue the INCO programme, although since 2000 funding has apparently not kept up with previous levels of support for ACP countries. In addition, development-oriented policies, such as those focusing on institutional capacity building, will need constant support in order to survive. In interviews for this study (not reported here), CTA was seen as a likely agency to take the initiative in this field, especially with regard to ACP interests. This means that CTA could assist in rebuilding constituencies for agricultural S&T, or for S&T policies in general, in ACP countries and in Europe. South Africa could be a good starting point; NEPAD might prove to be a good partner for Africa. The Caribbean Council for Science and Technology might be the partner in the Caribbean region; no suggestions can be made for the Pacific. Louk Box et. al.
