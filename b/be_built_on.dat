5|$|As a result, {{plans have}} been made for a major urban {{extension}} in the town, mainly {{to the east of}} the railway station. When finished, the town would be around 30% larger and 3,200 new homes would <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> 'Stanton Cross' site, with new schools, bus stops, community centres, shops, a doctor's surgery and new open spaces.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{plans are}} {{underway}} for two new residence halls for 1,240 students, called Parkview Hall to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the Panther Hall parking lot, north of FIU Stadium. Parkview Hall {{will be built}} in two phases in two separate buildings, each housing 620 and 600 students respectively, {{to be completed by}} Fall 2013 and Fall 2016.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, parking {{capacity}} at {{the transit}} center would be reduced by spaces eliminated for the station and a new bus station {{to the west of}} the current one. A partially below-grade parking garage will <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the southwest corner of the Northgate Mall parking lot with 450 spaces.|$|E
50|$|WZT (Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego - {{armoured}} {{recovery vehicle}}) was a Polish post-World War II {{armoured recovery vehicle}} series. It consists of five versions.The first two, WZT-1 and WZT-2 <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> T-55/T-55A hull, the WZT-3 <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> T-72M hull, the WZT-3M <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> PT-91 hull and the WZT-4 <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> PT-91M hull for Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|Between 1723 and 1733, Fort Manoel <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Manoel Island, while Fort Tigné <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Tigné Point in 1793. British barracks <b>were</b> also <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Tigné Point, {{but these}} {{have since been}} demolished.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, {{new housing}} <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Patchway Estate, {{just north of}} Filton Aerodrome, and {{bungalows}} <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Stoke Lane.|$|R
5|$|At MDSHA's Dayton Shop {{south of}} Glenelg, a half-diamond {{interchange}} will <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the southbound side of MD32 and a right-in/right-out interchange constructed for northbound MD32 traffic {{to access the}} maintenance facility.|$|E
5|$|Due to laxer laws about {{building}} housing on major roads, as London suburbs developed, properties {{were allowed to}} <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the North Circular Road. The original purpose-built road had been designed with no speed limit, as was typically {{the case in the}} 1920s, but by 1951 a 30mph speed limit was enforced along the route.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2009, the R.O.M. {{announced}} that it had sold the building and site to the University of Toronto, which plans to demolish the existing building {{to make way for}} additional facilities. In September 2014, the university announced preliminary plans for new facilities to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the site.|$|E
50|$|The Birchwood Estate <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the {{airfield}} in the 1970s, and the A46 Lincoln Bypass <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> it in 1986.|$|R
25|$|These {{structures}} <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> terraces and all {{surrounded by}} a perimeter wall, with different levels. Mostly <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the southern side, overlooking the lake.|$|R
50|$|The first Grizzly <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a {{commercial}} GMC chassis. The current versions <b>are</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a custom chassis supplied by Seagrave Fire Apparatus, Clintonville, Wisconsin.|$|R
5|$|In 1963, Charles MacNaughton, {{minister}} of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the western edge of}} the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay).|$|E
5|$|Sheet Harbour Consolidated School (SHCS) was an {{elementary}} school in the community. It was built in 1957, and served grades primary through six. It was closed and demolished in 2017, {{as part of a}} plan to consolidate the three schools in the area into one that will <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the site of SHCS and DMHS.|$|E
5|$|The schoolhouse, {{constructed}} in 1930, {{was the last}} structure to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the property. It was built by Rübel for his and his bookkeeper's families and designed to match the main adobe.|$|E
50|$|These {{structures}} <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> terraces and all {{surrounded by}} a perimeter wall, with different levels. Mostly <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the southern side, overlooking the lake.|$|R
50|$|Sawmills <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the river}} during the 1660s. The first Maine paper mill <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the river at}} Falmouth in 1731 by General Samuel Waldo.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} <b>is</b> mainly <b>built</b> <b>on</b> red sandstone. A part <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{lower and}} middle muschelkalk.|$|R
5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an {{artificial}} mound, but more commonly much of the motte {{would have to be}} constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the original ground surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.|$|E
5|$|A new {{government}} center was to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the hills northeast of Manila, {{or what is}} now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.|$|E
5|$|Along {{this route}} between New Haven and Hartford, the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1798 and opened in 1799, beginning at Grove Street in New Haven and leaving on Whitney Avenue, passing via Meriden and Berlin, and entering Hartford on Maple Avenue. This {{was one of}} the first turnpikes to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a straight line rather than along existing roads.|$|E
50|$|This Ancient Portuguese Fort <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the summit}} of Haldumulla hill. It has <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a {{strategic}} location to get a very {{good view of the}} surrounding area.|$|R
50|$|William Casselberry House <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Germantown Pike around 1872. Comparable to the A. Everhart Casselberry stone house, it <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Glebe lands by Abraham Everhart between 1844 and 1857.|$|R
50|$|The Church of San Marco alla Maresana (St Mark's <b>on</b> Maresana) <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the hill}} in 1619. Since the 1950s, some houses for wealthy Bergamaschi have also <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Maresana.|$|R
5|$|Davison House was {{the fourth}} {{residential}} quadrangle (quad) dormitory to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the campus Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York. Construction of Davison came during a period of rapid dorm-building spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897, Lathrop House in 1901, and finally Davison in 1902.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, {{fears of}} an Ottoman attack rose {{after the fall}} of Candia, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited Antonio Maurizio Valperga, the military engineer of the House of Savoy, to improve Malta's fortifications. Valperga designed a new fort to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the headland, and despite some criticism from within the order, the decision was eventually approved. The Florentine knight Fra Giovanni Francesco Ricasoli donated 20,000 scudi to construct the fort, and it was named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{the hotel}} was changed into a private lodging house and an extra storey of {{bedrooms}} added. The two watchman's boxes outside the museum were added around 1840. From 1853 until 1880 the building was let to the Bath Proprietary College. In 1891 the original 99-year lease of Sydney Gardens expired and its financial affairs had to be wound up. The Hotel and gardens were then sold, with plans published {{for the construction of}} a five-storey hotel to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the site. These plans were abandoned when the Empire Hotel was built on the opposite of the River Avon instead.|$|E
5000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the churchyard}} {{of the former}} All-Hallows-the-Great on Upper Thames Street (A3211). It <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a 2.5 acre site. It cost £18m, with £11m for the {{telecommunications}} equipment.|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{suggests}} that American greatness in the 20th century <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> oil, much as British greatness in the 19th century <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> coal, and Dutch greatness before that <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{wind and water}} power. When these energy sources became scarce or were replaced with a new source, argues Phillips, these countries lost their greatness to {{the master of the}} new energy source.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other temples, which <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a flat surface, Borobudur <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a bedrock hill, 265 m {{above sea}} level and 15 m above {{the floor of the}} dried-out paleolake. The lake's {{existence}} {{has been the subject of}} intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century; Borobudur was thought to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a lake shore or even surrounded by a lake.|$|R
5|$|In 1878, {{as part of}} {{the review}} of the defences of Singapore against threats from European powers in the region, it was decided that forts <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> either side of the {{entrance}} to New Harbour. Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It was found that the steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the palace}} {{including}} the entire estate {{was purchased by}} the City of Braunschweig. One condition for the purchase was that no structural changes ever be made and the park not <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on.</b> The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for public events. The nearly four-hectare park has been {{open to the public}} since 1964.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, the building's owners {{unveiled}} {{plans to}} use much of the building's vacant space. Under the proposal, a museum dedicated {{to the history of}} Times Square would <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the 15th through 17th floors, and the 18th floor would contain a new observatory. The ground level would also be renovated to provide an expanded entrance to the New York City Subway's Times Square–42nd Street station, which is directly underneath the building. Work would be completed by fall 2018.|$|E
50|$|Various {{mills and}} {{irrigation}} works have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Frenchman Creek. A 100 barrel roller mill <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the east side}} of the falls in Wauneta in 1887 by Blair and Polly.|$|R
50|$|Iași, Romania, {{is claimed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> seven hills. Many other cities {{of the world have}} similar traditions, Rome and Constantinople, for instance, were said to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> seven hills.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 Sheikh Badr was {{incorporated}} into a larger area renamed Givat Ram. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram, the Supreme Court of Israel, and the Jerusalem International Convention Center <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land formerly belonging to the village. Claims that the Israeli Knesset <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land belonging to the village are erroneous; the Knesset <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land leased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.|$|R
