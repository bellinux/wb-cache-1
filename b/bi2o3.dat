2500|$|Bismuth is a {{soft metal}} (MH 2.5) {{that is too}} brittle for any {{structural}} use. It has an open-packed crystalline structure (BCN 3+3) with bonding that is intermediate between metallic and covalent. For a metal, it has exceptionally low electrical and thermal conductivity. Most of the ordinary compounds of bismuth are covalent in nature. The oxide, <b>Bi2O3</b> is predominantly basic but will act as a weak acid in warm, very concentrated KOH. It can also be fused with potassium hydroxide in air, resulting in a brown mass of potassium bismuthate. The solution chemistry of bismuth is characterised by the formation of oxyanions; it forms anionic bismuthates in strongly basic solutions. Bismuth forms Zintl phases such as NaBi, Rb7In4Bi6 and Ba11Cd8Bi14. Bailar et al. refer to bismuth as being, 'the least [...] "metallic" [...] metal in its physical properties' given its brittle nature (and possibly) 'the lowest electrical conductivity of all metals.' ...|$|E
50|$|Interest has {{centred on}} δ- <b>Bi2O3</b> {{as it is}} principally an ionic conductor. In {{addition}} to electrical properties, thermal expansion properties are very important when considering possible applications for solid electrolytes. High thermal expansion coefficients represent large dimensional variations under heating and cooling, which would limit the performance of an electrolyte. The transition from the high-temperature δ- <b>Bi2O3</b> to the intermediate β- <b>Bi2O3</b> {{is accompanied by a}} large volume change and consequently, a deterioration of the mechanical properties of the material. This, combined with the very narrow stability range of the δ-phase (727-824 °C), has led to studies on its stabilization to room temperature.|$|E

It can be prepared by hydrothermal means and transforms to the α- phase at 400 °C.|$|E

50|$|The monoclinic α-phase {{transforms}} to the cubic δ-Bi2O3 when heated above 729 °C, {{which remains}} the structure until the melting point, 824 °C, is reached. The behaviour of <b>Bi2O3</b> on cooling from the δ-phase is more complex, {{with the possible}} formation of two intermediate metastable phases; the tetragonal β-phase or the body-centred cubic γ-phase. The γ-phase can exist at room temperature with very slow cooling rates, but α- <b>Bi2O3</b> always forms on cooling the β-phase. Even though when formed by heat, it reverts to α- <b>Bi2O3</b> when the temperature drops back below 727 °C, δ-Bi2O3 can be formed directly through electrodeposition and remain relatively stable at room temperature, in an electrolyte of bismuth compounds that is also rich in sodium or potassium hydroxide so as to have a pH near 14.|$|E
50|$|In {{the solid}} state {{reaction}} method bismuth oxide (<b>Bi2O3)</b> and iron oxide (Fe2O3) in a 1:1 mole ratio {{are mixed with}} a mortar, or by ball milling and then fired at elevated temperatures. The volatility of bismuth and the relatively stable competing ternary phases Bi25FeO39 (sillenite) and Bi2Fe4O9 (mullite) makes the solid state synthesis of phase pure and stoichiometric bismuth ferrite challenging. Typically a firing temperature of 800 to 880 Celsius is used for 5 to 60 minutes with rapid subsequent cooling. Excess <b>Bi2O3</b> has also been used a measure to compensate for bismuth volatility and to avoid formation of the Bi2Fe4O9 phase.|$|E

50|$|The α-phase {{exhibits}} p-type electronic conductivity (the {{charge is}} carried by positive holes) {{at room temperature}} which transforms to n-type conductivity (charge is carried by electrons) between 550 °C and 650 °C, depending on the oxygen partial pressure.The conductivity in the β, γ and δ-phases is predominantly ionic with oxide ions being the main charge carrier. Of these δ- <b>Bi2O3</b> has the highest reported conductivity. At 750 °C the conductivity of δ- <b>Bi2O3</b> is typically about 1 Scm1, about three orders of magnitude greater than the intermediate phases and four orders greater than the monoclinic phase. The conductivity in the β, γ and δ-phases is predominantly ionic with oxide ions being the main charge carrier. δ- <b>Bi2O3</b> has a defective fluorite-type crystal structure in which two of the eight oxygen sites in the unit cell are vacant. These intrinsic vacancies are highly mobile due to the high polarisability of the cation sub-lattice with the 6s2 lone pair electrons of Bi3+. The Bi-O bonds have covalent bond character and are therefore weaker than purely ionic bonds, so the oxygen ions can jump into vacancies more freely.|$|E
5000|$|Bismuth ferrite melts incongruently, {{but it can}} {{be grown}} from a bismuth oxide rich flux (e.g. a 4:1:1 mixture of <b>Bi2O3,</b> Fe2O3 and B2O3 at {{approximately}} 750-800 Celsius).

50|$|<b>Bi2O3</b> easily forms solid {{solutions}} {{with many}} other metal oxides. These doped systems exhibit a complex array of structures and properties dependent {{on the type of}} dopant, the dopant concentration and the thermal history of the sample. The most widely studied systems are those involving rare earth metal oxides, Ln2O3, including yttria, Y2O3. Rare earth metal cations are generally very stable, have similar chemical properties to one another and are similar in size to Bi3+, which has a radius of 1.03 Å, making them all excellent dopants. Furthermore, their ionic radii decrease fairly uniformly from La3+ (1.032 Å), through Nd3+, (0.983 Å), Gd3+, (0.938 Å), Dy3+, (0.912 Å) and Er3+, (0.89 Å), to Lu3+, (0.861 Å) (known as the ‘lanthanide contraction’), making them useful to study the effect of dopant size on the stability of the <b>Bi2O3</b> phases.|$|E
50|$|Bismite is a {{bismuth oxide}} mineral, bismuth {{trioxide}} or <b>Bi2O3.</b> It is a monoclinic mineral, but the typical form of occurrence is massive and clay-like with no macroscopic crystals. The color varies from green to yellow. It has a Mohs hardness of 4 to 5 and a specific gravity of 8.5 to 9.5, quite high for a nonmetallic mineral.|$|E
50|$|Bismuth {{titanate}} ceramics can {{be produced}} by heating a mixture of bismuth and titanium oxides.

50|$|While most CICPs {{are formed}} {{exclusively}} through solid state, high temperature calcination, bismuth vanadate can be formed {{from a series}} of pH controlled precipitation reactions (it is important to note these reactions can be carried out with or without the presence of molybdenum depending on the desired final phase). It is also possible to start with the parent oxides (<b>Bi2O3</b> and V2O5) and perform a high temperature calcination to achieve a pure product.|$|E

Shuk et al. (1996) and Sammes et al. (1999) suggest that because of the high degree of disorder in δ- <b>Bi2O3,</b> the Willis model could also be used to describe its structure.|$|E

Its application as a semiconductor involves mixing <b>Bi2O3,</b> PbO, and SiO2, into a paint and coat solar panels with the paint.

50|$|This is a {{materials}} issue, {{particularly for}} the electrolyte in the SOFC. YSZ is {{the most commonly used}} electrolyte because of its superior stability, despite not having the highest conductivity. Currently, the thickness of YSZ electrolytes is a minimum of ~10 μm due to deposition methods, and this requires a temperature above 700 °C. Therefore, low-temperature SOFCs are only possible with higher conductivity electrolytes. Various alternatives that could be successful at low temperature include gallium-doped ceria (GDC) and erbia-cation-stabilized bismuth (ERB). They have superior ionic conductivity at lower temperatures, but this comes at the expense of lower thermodynamic stability. CeO2 electrolytes become electronically conductive and <b>Bi2O3</b> electrolytes decompose to metallic Bi under the reducing fuel environment.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of oxygen atoms within the unit cell of δ-Bi2O3 {{has been the}} subject of much debate in the past. Three different models have been proposed. Sillén (1937) used powder X-ray diffraction on quenched samples and reported the structure of <b>Bi2O3</b> was a simple cubic phase with oxygen vacancies ordered along<111>, i.e. along the cube body diagonal. Gattow and Schroder (1962) rejected this model, preferring to describe each oxygen site (8c site) in the unit cell as having 75% occupancy. In other words, the six oxygen atoms are randomly distributed over the eight possible oxygen sites in the unit cell. Currently, most experts seem to favour the latter description as a completely disordered oxygen sub-lattice accounts for the high conductivity in a better way.|$|E

40|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} {{have been studied}} extensively {{over the past decade}} or so as potential candidates for memory applications, since they possess a unique set of properties, including fast polarization switching and non-volatility. The two major candidate materials being studied for integration into ferroelectric random access memories (FeRAMs) are lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and strontium bismuth tantalate (SrBi₂Ta₂O₉ or SBT). Overall, PZT has probably been the most extensively studied of the two materials, however SBT has received a lot of attention over the past few years due to its fatigue resistance, large remanent polarization (Pᵣ), and low coercive field (E(c)) on standard metal electrodes. The purpose of this project was to study the factors that influence the development of ferroelectric properties of sol-gel derived SBT thin films, including composition, heat treatment, phase development, and microstructure. The results show that SBT crystallite size is the single most important factor in determining the ferroelectric properties of SBT compositions with Sr contents ranging from stoichiometric to 20 % deficient. SBT volume fraction also plays an important role. Therefore, composition, heat treatment, etc., are only important in that they help establish the SBT crystallite size and SBT area fraction of a particular film.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} developing a predictive method {{for determining the}} dynamic densification behavior of thermite powder mixtures consisting of equivolumetric mixtures of Ta + Fe₂O₃ and Ta + <b>Bi₂O₃.</b> Of primary importance to these highly reactive powder mixtures {{is the ability to}} characterize the stress at which full compaction occurs, the crush strength, which can significantly influence the stress required to initiate reaction during dynamic or impact loading. Examined specifically are the quasi-static and dynamic compaction responses of these mixtures. Experimentally obtained compaction responses in the quasi-static regime are analyzed using available compaction models, and an analysis technique is developed that allows for a correct measurement of the apparent yield strength of the powder mixtures. The correctly determined apparent yield strength is combined with an equation of state to yield a prediction of the shock densification response, including the dynamic crush strength of the thermite powder mixtures. The validated approach is also extended to the Al + Fe₂O₃ thermite system. It is found that accurate predictions of the crush strength can be obtained through determination of the apparent yield strength of the powder mixture when incorporated into the equation of state. It is observed that the predictive ability in the incomplete compaction region is configurationally dependent for highly heterogeneous thermite powder systems, which is in turn influenced by particle morphology and differences in intrinsic properties of constituents (density, strength, etc.).

H 577 M AP 2016 Li 139 pages :color illustrationsFerroelectric-photovoltaic (FePV) devices {{employing}} a homogeneous ferroelectric material {{as the light}} absorbing layer, have been investigated intensively during the past decades. The physical mechanism governing the FePV effect is distinctly {{different from that of}} a typical p-n junction type photovoltaic (PV) effect, whose open-circuit voltage is limited by the bandgap of the light absorbing material. Therefore, FePV material is regarded as the potential candidate for above-bandgap solar cells. Among all the FePV materials, BiFeO₃ (BFO), possessing simultaneous ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders at room temperature, is most widely studied in the last decade. In this thesis, systematic experimental work has been carried out to investigate the FePV effect in BFO. First, the influence of secondary phase on FePV of BFO thin film was examined. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was used to fabricate epitaxial BFO thin films. Three different targets were used for laser ablation and different ablation parameters (oxygen pressure and laser pulse frequency) were tried to obtain phase pure BFO thin film. Our results demonstrated that the photocurrent and photoconductivity of BFO thin films are closely related to <b>Bi₂O₃</b> secondary phase and bismuth vacancies. A large photocurrent density of 12 mA/cm², a large remnant polarization of 60 μC/cm² and good switching behaviour were observed in optimized epitaxial BFO films. Second, the influence of metal-semiconductor interface effect on BFO FePV was studied. Titanium (Ti) and gold (Au) metals are used as symmetric in-plane electrodes, respectively, on optimized BFO thin films. Since the work functions of Ti and Au are different, which are above and beneath the Fermi level of BFO, respectively, Ohmic contact is formed at the Ti/BFO interface and Schottky contact is formed at the Au/BFO interface. The contact types were confirmed by Kelvin probe force microscopy. The photovoltaic behaviours of these two types of electrode BFO thin films were performed and the photocurrent is larger in a BFO thin film with an Ohmic contact. Last, but not least, the strain effect on BFO FePV behaviour was studied. Epitaxial BFO thin films are deposited on LaAlO₃ (LAO) [1 0 0] and 0. 67 Pb(Mg₁/₃Nb₂/₃) O 3 - 0. 33 PbTiO₃ (PMN-PT) [1 1 1] substrates. No obvious increase in short circuit photo-current was detected in BFO/LAO sample which has a tetragonal-like BFO phase, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. However, large photoconductivity at large voltage bias was obtained. A small but non-trivial photovoltaic effect was observed in BFO/PMN-PT sample with a rhombohedral structure. It is concluded that the FePV effect is also closely related to the symmetry group of the lattice structure. A prominent photo-response was observed in strain-free electrospun BFO nanofibers, which may have potential applications due to the flexible nature of the nanofibers. Department of Applied PhysicsM.

40|$|Multiferroics {{are unique}} {{materials}} that display multiple ferroic properties (ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity) simultaneously. A number of materials containing bismuth have intrinsic multiferroic properties, including BiFeO₃ and BiCrO₃. Among them, BiFeO₃ has attracted widespread attention because BiFeO₃ {{was the first}} material to display multiferroic behaviour at ambient temperature. A weak ferromagnetism occurs only at low temperatures depending on synthesis conditions. This thesis reports the structural, magnetic and optical properties of nanostructured BiFeO₃ thin films prepared by two novel approaches of ion beam sputtering and ion implantation techniques. Nanocrystalline BiFeO₃ films were prepared at ambient temperature by sputtering and thermal annealing at 500 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. The annealing resulted {{in the formation of}} multiferroic BiFeO₃ phase with a reduction of iron oxide and bismuth phases. Superparamagnetism was observed and could be attributed to magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles. The magnetic properties were mainly due to magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles. The saturation magnetic moment was 60 % lower after annealing, which was due to Fe in phases of iron oxide being incorporated into BiFeO₃ nanoparticles. An exchange bias was observed before and after annealing. The exchange bias cannot be attributed to BiFeO₃ structure. Instead, the exchange has likely arisen from magnetite and maghemite cores with spin-disordered shells. Piezoelectric responses measured by piezoelectric force microscopy confirmed the presence of BiFeO₃ ferroelectric material. The Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and optical studies were used to calculate an anomalously high Verdet constant. The MOKE and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) displayed a significant modification in function of the wavelength. Further increasing the annealing temperature lead to an increase in iron oxide phases, while increasing the annealing duration reduced the iron oxide phases, however this increases the fraction of Bi₂Fe₄O₉ and <b>Bi₂O₃.</b> Another approach to synthesise BiFeO₃ thin film was investigated by bismuth ion implantation into iron oxide thin film. An as-made iron oxide film subsequently implanted with bismuth and annealed showed a 6. 5 % reduction of the ferromagnetic phase fraction. An annealed iron oxide film subsequently implanted with bismuth and annealed show that the ferromagnetic phase was present at less than 4 % while Fe₃O₄ and γ-Fe₂O₃ increased to 7 %. The coercive field is affected by annealing. However, this field is not affected by the bismuth implantation. For the first-time, a preliminary investigation reporting the implantation of Bi then Fe then O into SiO₂:Si was made with the aim to synthesise BiFeO₃ films and magnetic nanoparticles. The implantation of Fe then O then Bi into SiO₂:Si contained a mix of iron oxides: α-Fe₂O₃ and Fe₃O₄, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, while γ-Fe₂O₃ was most likely also present in the film. The as-implanted sample displayed a sign of a superparamagnetic phase that was lost with annealing the sample. Preliminary investigations of another multiferroic material, BiCrO₃, were carried out. Thin films of BiCrO₃ were prepared by ion beam sputtering and annealing the sample in an oxygen atmosphere which lead to BiCrxOy with chromium oxides and bismuth oxide phases. Magnetic enhancement was observed when annealing above 700 °C. Annealing in an oxygen atmosphere followed by an argon atmosphere created a superparamagnetic phase that was not visible under other annealing conditions...|$|E
