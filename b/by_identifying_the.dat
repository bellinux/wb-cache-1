5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the Iliad <b>by</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> places described by Homer.|$|E

But in informal relations the social life remained unaltered.

25|$|For medical purposes, {{the exact}} number of {{helminth}} eggs is less important and therefore most diagnoses are made simply <b>by</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> appearance of the worm or eggs in feces.

The Kato technique (also called the Kato-Katz technique) is a laboratory method for preparing human stool samples prior to searching for parasite eggs. Eggs per gram is a laboratory test that determines the number of eggs per gram of feces in patients suspected of having a parasitological infection, such as schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|The Colony's first Surveyor General John Septimus Roe {{recognised}} {{the qualities}} of the area and tried to protect it, <b>by</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> land to be set aside for public purposes. By 1835 Roe's protection was overturned and the first shipment of five tonnes of Jarrah was cut on Mt Eliza, becoming the colony's first export. Logging in the area continued until 1871 when Roe's successor Malcolm Fraser persuaded the then Governor Weld to set aside 1.75km² as public reserve. In 1890 this was enlarged to its current size by Sir John Forrest, {{the first president of}} the Board appointed under the Parks and Reserves Act 1895. Forrest planted the first tree, a Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla), and other trees were introduced to the site, Eucalyptus ficifolia and exotic species of Pinus; few of these were successful due to lack of irrigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} and specificity of seven microscopy-based Cryptosporidium oocyst detection methods were compared after application to unconcentrated fecal smears. The seven methods were as follows: (i) a commercial acid-fast (AF) stain (VOLU-SOL) method, (ii) Truant auramine-rhodamine (AR) stain method, (iii) fluorescein-conjugated C 1 B 3 monoclonal antibody (MAb) direct fluorescence method, (iv) OW 3 MAb indirect fluorescence method, (v) biotinylated OW 3 indirect fluorescence method, (vi) biotinylated OW 3 -indirect diaminobenzidine (DAB) method, and (vii) biotinylated OW 3 -aminoethylcarbazole (AEC) method. A total of 281 randomly collected Formalin-fixed fecal samples (submitted to the Maricopa County Health Department, Phoenix, Ariz.) and 30 known positives (Formalin-fixed and K 2 Cr 2 O 7 -preserved stools from our laboratory) were examined in a blind test; 32 of 311 samples (10. 3 %) were confirmed positive. Of the confirmed positives, 40. 6 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> AF method, 93. 8 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> AR method, 93. 8 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> C 1 B 3 method, 81. 3 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> OW 3 -DAB method, 71. 9 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> OW 3 -AEC method, 100 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> OW 3 indirect fluorescence method, and 100 % were <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> biotinylated OW 3 indirect fluorescence method.

25|$|The {{pedagogy}} of post-structuralism {{is marked}} by an attempt to redefine rhetoric {{as it relates to}} composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing {{can be seen as a}} metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act. Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery <b>by</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, these Hutu {{nationalist}} elites {{made their}} political debut when a UN {{mission to the}} region was greeted with two declarations of independence by the Rwandan people. The first, a proclamation by the Mwami’s (king’s) high council proposed a rapid transfer of power from the Belgians to the Tutsi royal leadership. Called Mise au Point, the document {{emphasized the importance of}} ending racial tensions between white colonizers and black colonials. One month later, the Hutu political elites responded with their own declaration, the “Bahutu Manifesto”. This document called for a double liberation of the Hutu people, first from the race of white colonials, and second from the race of Hamitic oppressors, the Tutsi. The document in many ways established the future tone of the Hutu nationalist movement <b>by</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> “indigenous racial problem” of Rwanda as the social, political, and economic “monopoly which is held by one race, the Tutsi.” The manifesto also served as a prescient omen that future political identities in Rwanda would be defined along racial identities.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 Grassi {{investigated}} {{his native}} hometown Rovellasca {{for the high}} mortality of cats and discovered that they were heavily infected with the nematode Dochmius balsami. In 1878, while still {{a student at the}} University of Pavia, he discovered anchylostomiasis in Italy from <b>by</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> eggs from the faeces of infected individuals. He continued to make great impacts on the study of Anguillula intestinalis, filarial worms, Trichocephalus dispar, and Bilharzia. He was the first to show that the human dwarf tapeworm Taenia nana is able to go through its entire life cycle in one animal, without the need of an intermediate host, a notion that had long been rejected. He was also the first to show that the flea Pulex serraticeps is the intermediate host of feline tapeworm Taenia elliptica. Thus he proposed that swallowing of infected fleas (for example, with milk) might be the reason for taeniasis in children. In 1879 he published a work on the life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis, and erected the genus Strongyloides. In 1890 he, with Salvatore Calandruccio, described Dipetalonema reconditum, a non-pathogenic filarial worm of dogs, and showed that the parasite completed its development in human fleas, Pulex irritans.|$|E
