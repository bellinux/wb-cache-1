50|$|Piers John Sellers OBE (11 April 1955 - 23 December 2016) was a British-American meteorologist, NASA {{astronaut}} and Director of the Earth Science Division at NASA/GSFC. He was {{a veteran}} of three space shuttle missions.Sellers attended Cranbrook School, Cranbrook, Kent, United Kingdom, until 1973, and achieved a bachelor's degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh in 1976. In 1981 he gained a doctorate in <b>biometeorology</b> from the University of Leeds. In 2011, Sellers retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps.|$|E
50|$|Sellers {{was born}} in Crowborough, Sussex, the second born of five boys. His {{education}} started at Tyttenhanger Lodge Pre-preparatory School in Seaford, East Sussex, and Cranbrook School, Kent, from which he graduated in 1973 and where he was trained as a Royal Air Force cadet to pilot gliders and powered aircraft. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh and a doctorate in <b>biometeorology</b> from the University of Leeds. Sellers married the former Amanda Lomas, a nurse from Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, before they moved to the US. This marriage ended in divorce.|$|E
50|$|The {{methods and}} {{measurements}} traditionally used in <b>biometeorology</b> are not different {{when applied to}} study the interactions between human bodies and the atmosphere, but some aspects or applications may have been explored more extensively. For instance, wind chill has been investigated to determine the time period an individual can sustain exposure to given temperature and wind conditions. Another important example concerns the study of airborne allergens (such as pollens and aerosols) {{and their impact on}} individuals: weather conditions can favor or hinder the release as well as the transport and deposition of these allergens, sometimes severely affecting the well-being of sensitive populations.|$|E

40|$|The International Society of <b>Biometeorology</b> (ISB) {{has covered}} {{significant}} {{breadth and depth}} addressing fundamental and applied societal and environmental challenges in the last 60 years. <b>Biometeorology</b> is an interdisciplinary science connecting living organisms to their environment, but {{there is very little}} understanding of the existence and placement of this discipline within formal educational systems and institutions. It is thus difficult to project the ability of members of the biometeorological community—especially the biometeorologists of the future—to help solve global challenges. In this paper, we ask: At present, how we are training people to understand and think about <b>biometeorology?</b> We also ask: What are the current tools and opportunities in which biometeorologists might address future challenges? Finally, we connect these two questions by asking: What type of new training and skill development is needed to better educate “biometeorologists of the future” to more effectively address the future challenges? To answer these questions, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence from an educationally focused workshop attended by new professionals in <b>biometeorology.</b> We identify four common themes (thermal comfort and exposures, agricultural productivity, air quality, and urbanization) that biometeorologists are currently studying and that we expect to be important in the future based on their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Review of recent literature within each of these thematic areas highlights a wide array of skill sets and perspectives that biometeorologists are already using. Current and new professionals within the ISB have noted highly varying and largely improvised educational pathways into the field. While variability and improvisation may be assets in promoting flexibility, adaptation, and interdisciplinarity, the lack of formal training in <b>biometeorology</b> raises concerns {{about the extent to which}} continuing generations of scholars will identify and engage with the community of scholarship that the ISB has developed over its 60 -year history...|$|E
40|$|Animal <b>biometeorology</b> (insects excluded) {{has been}} part of the International Journal of <b>Biometeorology</b> since its {{inception}} in 1958. Over the first 60  years of the journal, 480 animal <b>biometeorology</b> papers were published. Thus, approximately 14 % of published papers dealt with animals. Over the first 60  years, data from more than 50 animal species was presented, with the lead authors coming from 48 countries. The two most common species used in animal papers between 1957 and 2016 were cattle (109 papers: 22. 7 % of all animal papers) and rats (96 papers: 20. 0 % of all animal papers). Although cattle and rats dominated, the species in the most cited paper (240 citations) was chickens, followed by bird migration (155 citations), and general livestock (118 citations). Overall, five papers exceeded 100 citations, and a further two exceeded 200 citations. In the last decade, 126 animal papers were published (26 % of all animal papers). Many of these papers had a focus on livestock production in developing countries especially Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Aerobiology and <b>biometeorology</b> {{are related}} fields. Here we provide a broad review of {{aerobiology}} {{articles published in}} the International Journal of <b>Biometeorology</b> (IJB) over the past 60 years. We consider how the quantity of such work has varied over this period as well as which regions and countries have {{been the focus of}} such work, and where there is a relative paucity. We then focus on a number of highlights and themes in this research, including aerobiology and climate change and aerobiological modelling and forecasting. While much of the article focusses on airborne pollen research, we also discuss the extent to which other airborne organic particles such as fungal spores and bacteria have been the focus of research published in IJB. Also considered are knowledge gaps and research needs and priorities with respect to the field of aerobiology. While the IJB {{has been one of the}} main platforms for presenting aerobiological research over recent decades, the article highlights the need for the field of aerobiology to embrace new sampling technologies such as spectral analysis and next-generation sequencing to identify and quantify airborne biological particles...|$|E

A digital elevation model {{is used to calculate}} terrain properties such as slope, aspect, and surface area. Distributed water storage capacity is calculated by combining depth-tobedrock data with soil porosity data. Separate energy balances are calculated for the vegetation, the soil, and the snow pack, if present. The description of the snow pack as a single layer is based on the Utah Energy Balance Snow Accumulation and Melt Model. Lateral subsurface flow in the soil above the bedrock is calculated using the Boussinesq equation. Saturation-excess surface runoff is transported to neighboring cells by assuming instantaneous redistribution. The model is tested in the Boise-Front Experimental Watershed, near Boise, Idaho. Preliminary calibration results show that the model is able to describe catchment outflow as well as spatially distributed snow depth, soil water content, and soil temperature over a full year...|$|E
