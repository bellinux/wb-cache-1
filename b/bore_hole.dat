It stated that no water from this well entered the public water supply and that a nearby well and pumping station had been closed since the fire as a precaution. The chemical is a known health risk and the UK government had been about to ban its use.|$|E
5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main {{concern is that the}} lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E

25|$|The second {{design is}} the top-entry holder {{consists}} of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods include}} {{shrinkage}} stope mining, which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining, which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and {{room and pillar}} mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support {{the roof of the}} room. Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining, in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining, which is mining of hard rock (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary) materials, <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and block caving.|$|E
500|$|By plan, the {{following}} summer, {{the team was}} to drill down again to take a sample of that ice and analyze it. The Russians resumed drilling into the lake in January 2012 and reached the upper {{surface of the water}} on 6 February 2012. [...] The researchers allowed the rushing lake water to freeze within the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> and months later, they collected ice core samples of this newly formed ice and sent to the Laboratory for Glaciology and Environmental Geophysics in Grenoble, France, for analysis.|$|E

500|$|Scientific {{knowledge}} of the geologic history of Vesuvius comes from core samples taken from a [...] plus <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> on the flanks of the volcano, extending into Mesozoic rock.

Instead of drilling all the way into the water, they said they would stop just above it when a sensor on the thermal drill detected free water. At that point, the drill was to be stopped and extracted from the <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> [...] Removal of the drill would lower the pressure beneath it, drawing water into the hole to be left to freeze, creating a plug of ice {{in the bottom of the}} hole.

2500|$|In 1922, the British {{government}} secured undertakings {{from the}} trucial rulers not to sign concessions with foreign companies. Aware {{of the potential}} for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were agreed with local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement, which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a [...] <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.|$|E
