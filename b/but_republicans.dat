5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E
5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E

5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, {{was indicted}} for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was {{appointed}} to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county's Fiscal Court authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley's surety bond. In May 1909, Smedley {{was arrested and charged}} with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county's finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley's opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county's entire Democratic organization was corrupt and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he had no more responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of William Goebel, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. He pointed to his improvement of the county's finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite of the scandal, Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.|$|E

25|$|Although {{politically}} diverse, Fargo and Cass County {{in general}} {{has a history}} as a Republican-leaning area. Democrats have tended {{to do well in}} state elections in the older and established areas of Fargo (Districts 11 and 21), <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> have dominated throughout much of the newer areas of the city. George W. Bush carried Fargo as well as the rest of Cass County in the 2004 presidential election, with nearly 60 {{percent of the vote in}} both areas. In 2008, Democratic candidate Barack Obama won the majority of votes in Cass County, with a voting percentage very close to the percentage Obama received in the entire nation, while John McCain won the majority of votes in North Dakota. Mitt Romney's margin in 2012 over Barack Obama in Cass County was 49.9% to 47%. while Donald Trump expanded the margin to double digits in 2016 with a 49.2% to 38.8% vote tally against Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2011, Obama {{announced}} that he would seek re-election in the 2012 presidential election. Obama did not face any significant rivals for the 2012 Democratic nomination. Obama's Republican opponent in the general election, former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, advocated for lower taxes, spending cuts, an increase in defense spending, and a repeal of Obamacare (which was ironically based on a Massachusetts healthcare plan developed under Romney). Obama's campaign was based in Chicago and run by many former members of the White House staff and members of the successful 2008 campaign. Obama won re-election with 332 (out of a total of 538) electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote, making him the first person since Dwight Eisenhower to twice win 51 percent of the vote. According to exit polls, Obama won a majority of the vote from women, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, people under 45, people making less than $50,000 per year, people inhabiting large or mid-sized cities, liberals, moderates, the unmarried, gays, and people with no college education, some college education, or graduate degrees. In addition to the presidential election victory, the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of Congress, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> retained control of the House.|$|E
500|$|The {{rift between}} the Radicals, {{including}} Wilson, and President Johnson grew as Johnson attempted to implement his more lenient Reconstruction policies. Johnson vetoed {{the bill to}} establish the Freedmen's Bureau, {{as well as other}} Radical measures to protect African American civil rights—measures which Wilson supported. Wilson supported the Senate effort to impeach Johnson, saying that Johnson was [...] "unworthy, if not criminal" [...] in his conduct by resisting Congressional Reconstruction measures, many of which were passed over his vetoes. At the 1868 Senate trial Wilson voted for Johnson's impeachment, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to remove Johnson from office. [...] (With 36 [...] "guilty" [...] votes needed for removal, the Senate results were 35 to 19 on all three post-trial ballots.) ...|$|E
50|$|In the Senate, Republicans {{picked up}} one seat, giving them half of {{the seats in the}} chamber. With the office of Vice President vacant, neither party {{controlled}} a majority, <b>but</b> <b>Republican</b> George F. Edmunds won re-election as President pro tempore.|$|R

50|$|The Democrats in the South {{had worked}} hard, <b>but</b> <b>Republican</b> regimes {{controlled}} the election machinery and carried {{all of the}} states there except Georgia and Louisiana, where activity by the Ku Klux Klan was already affecting Republicans’ ability to express their opinion.|$|R
500|$|After the {{enabling}} act was passed, territorial legislators had {{a difficult}} time writing a state constitution. [...] A constitutional convention was assembled in July 1857, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Democrats were deeply divided. [...] In fact, they formed two separate constitutional conventions and drafted two separate constitutions. [...] Eventually, the two groups formed a conference committee and worked out a common constitution. [...] The divisions continued, though, because Republicans refused to sign a document that had Democratic signatures on it, and vice versa. [...] One copy of the constitution was written on white paper and signed only by Republicans, while the other copy was written on blue-tinged paper and signed by Democrats. [...] These copies were signed on August 29, 1857. [...] An election was called on October 13, 1857, where Minnesota residents would vote to approve or disapprove the constitution. [...] The constitution was approved by 30,055 voters, while 571 rejected it.|$|E
500|$|The {{move towards}} greater {{involvement}} in political {{issues and the}} increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where {{the views of the}} show fit in the political spectrum. Adam Clymer, among many others, has argued that The Daily Show is more critical of Republicans than Democrats. Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election, acknowledged that the show has a more liberal point of view, but that it is not [...] "a liberal organization" [...] with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny. He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an [...] "equal opportunity offender", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because [...] "I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not." [...] In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that The Daily Show is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat, said in an interview during the Bush Administration, when the Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate: [...] "We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power {{it would be easier to}} attack them, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 1970 U.S. Senate {{election}} from Michigan, state Republicans {{were looking}} for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart, a two-term incumbent. [...] Hart was heavily favored to win re-election, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> thought he might be vulnerable on ideological grounds (for being too liberal) and owing to an anti-war protest arrest involving his wife. [...] George Romney's name was mentioned as a possible candidate. Indeed, Nixon, who never had good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds, had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him, and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race. [...] However, George {{came up with the idea}} of Lenore running, and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969. [...] Lenore's name began being mentioned by other Republicans, even though she professed not to want to run unless no other candidate could be found. [...] U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan thought she could unite the state party's different factions, but Governor William Milliken, who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power, opposed the notion. [...] And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband's behalf, there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George's options open. [...] Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race.|$|E
50|$|Louisiana: Republicans ran several {{candidates}} at once against incumbent Mary Landrieu (D), {{hoping to}} push her vote below 50% and force a runoff in December (according to Louisiana law). They did force a runoff, <b>but</b> <b>Republican</b> Suzanne Haik Terrell narrowly lost the runoff.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{leaving office}} in 1874, Moses {{was chosen by}} the General Assembly to {{a seat on the}} circuit court, <b>but</b> <b>Republican</b> Governor Chamberlain blocked his {{appointment}} and it was opposed by many within the party because of his reputation for corruption while governor.|$|R
50|$|In 1876, Sexton {{was elected}} as a Democrat to the Illinois House of Representatives. He was re-elected {{in the next}} three elections, serving a total of eight years in the 6th district.

2500|$|In the Lenadoon area of West Belfast, the RUC shot a 14-year-old boy and 13-year-old {{girl with}} plastic bullets. The boy was {{struck in the}} head and spent three days in a coma, while the girl was struck in the face. The RUC said there was rioting in the area at the time, <b>but</b> <b>republicans</b> denied this, {{claiming}} the RUC had arrived in Land Rovers and [...] "opened fire on groups of young people returning home from a disco".|$|E
2500|$|The law was {{championed by}} President Barack Obama and {{supported}} by most Democrats, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> have tried numerous times to overturn the law. [...] When the Obama Administration {{announced that it would}} be delaying the implementation of part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was seen as a new opportunity to fight against the bill, leading to the proposal of the Authority for Mandate Delay Act and the Fairness for American Families Act.|$|E
2500|$|This {{controversy}} has often split {{along party lines}} with Democrats supporting the regulation and Republicans opposing it. [...] Democrats believe that Open Internet is essential to providing fair access to information, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> argue {{that the best way}} for the internet to flourish is for the government to stay out of it. However, in a major exception to this rule, President George W. Bush (R) decided to impose net neutrality regulation on Comcast in 2008. [...] This initiative was broadened under President Barack Obama into the FCC proposal in place today.|$|E
50|$|Lincoln's {{preliminary}} Emancipation Proclamation {{was issued}} September 22, 1862.

2500|$|In Florida, State Representative Joe Negron {{was picked}} to fill Foley's {{spot in the}} November elections. The Democratic nominee for the seat was Tim Mahoney. Florida law {{prohibited}} Foley's name from being removed from the ballot {{at the time of}} his withdrawal from the race, <b>but</b> <b>Republicans</b> hoped that voters would recognize that a vote for Foley would transfer to Negron as a substitute candidate. [...] Nevertheless, Boehner noted that because of the procedures in Florida, [...] "to vote for this candidate, you have to vote for Mark Foley. How many people are going to hold their nose to do that?" [...] Negron used the slogan, [...] "Punch Foley for Joe", having the double meaning of officially voting for Foley in order to really elect Negron as well as evoking images of physically striking the offending member of Congress. Foley's Republican-held seat was regarded as unlikely to change hands before the scandal broke, but CQPolitics changed its rating of the race from Safe Republican where it had stood since July to Leans Democratic in early-October. On Election Day, Mahoney won the seat.|$|E
2500|$|But {{his most}} {{important}} decision came in the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) had negotiated contracts eight times, and each time a strike action of varying length had occurred. By the spring of 1994, {{the possibility of a}} strike was rising, as owners and players argued over a salary cap, revenue-sharing (which would [...] "tax" [...] the sport's top money-making teams and redistribute the funds to the weakest teams), and the extent of salary arbitration. The NLRB was closely monitoring the situation, (in no small part because Chairman Gould was an avid baseball fan). On July 28, the MLBPA set a deadline of August 12, 1994, for a new collective bargaining agreement or it would strike. The strike began on August 12, but despite the appointment of former Secretary of Labor William Usery, Jr. as a special mediator on October 13 the World Series was cancelled {{for the first time in}} history. On December 22, the owners unilaterally imposed a salary cap and eliminated salary arbitration. On Christmas Eve, MLB announced it would start spring training with strikebreaker players. Two days later, the owners and the players' association both filed unfair labor practice (ULP) complaints with the NLRB, with each side claiming the other had not negotiated in good faith. Meanwhile, the NLRB had initiated its own investigation into the strike (led by NLRB Regional Director Dan Silverman and NLRB General Counsel Fred Feinstein). The key issue for the board was whether the legal rules of negotiation had been followed. Under American labor law, the employer is permitted to implement its last offer if an impasse had been reached. But the two sides had been negotiating since November, and it was not entirely clear that an impasse had been reached. Congress was considering legislation to make baseball subject to United States antitrust law, and on January 26 President Bill Clinton announced that the two sides would have to make major progress to an agreement by February 6 or the federal government would intervene. On February 3, the owners unilaterally lifted their salary cap. But with no agreement even close, Usery hinted that he would recommend a legislative solution (perhaps removing the antitrust exemption, perhaps imposing binding arbitration) to the President. <b>But</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Congress (who had just won control of the House and Senate) signaled they would not enact any such legislation.|$|E
