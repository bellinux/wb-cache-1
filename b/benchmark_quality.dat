We have provided a detailed error analysis of focal-point schemes commonly used in <b>benchmark</b> <b>quality</b> computations, as well as provide error and speedup analysis of commonly used approximations to these methods. An analysis of basis set effects on higher-order corrections to MP 2 /CBS has been carried out, providing the community error bounds on future benchmarks. We demonstrate how these high-level computations can elucidate a better understanding of non-bonded interactions in chemistry as well as provide high-quality reference data to refit existing methods against to increase the overall accuracy of the method.
