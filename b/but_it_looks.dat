500|$|We {{want to stay}} in New York, New York {{has been}} {{incredibly}} good to us. It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show... Our New York crew is spectacular, they've worked their [...] off to make the show look great. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.|$|E
500|$|Judge Vani Gopal Sharma has {{supposedly}} {{been receiving}} threats since her {{verdict in the}} case. The High Court had directed adequate security to be provided to her, but later she again informed the High Court of the failure to increase security. She sought transfer to Panchkula, a city near Chandigarh. She requested this shortly after her verdict was denounced vehemently by the khap panchayats. The police chief of Karnal district, Rakesh Kumar Arya, claimed that Sharma did not complain about inadequate security. [...] "There is no truth in reports that Karnal's Additional District Sessions Judge wants {{to move out of}} the district on account of inadequate security," [...] he said. [...] "I don't know whether any such request was made, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> unlikely." ...|$|E
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude {{there is no time}} to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> a bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of the}} Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, President Bush {{dismissed}} Arafat as {{a negotiating}} partner, {{saying he had}} [...] "failed as a leader" [...] and accused him of undercutting Abbas when he was prime minister (Abbas resigned the same year {{he was given the}} position). Arafat had a mixed relationship with the leaders of other Arab nations. His support from Arab leaders tended to increase whenever he was pressured by Israel; for example, when Israel declared in 2003 it had made the decision, in principle, to remove him from the Israeli-controlled West Bank. In an interview with the Arabic news network Al Jazeera, Arafat responded to Ariel Sharon's suggestion that he be exiled from the Palestinian territories permanently, by stating, [...] "Is it his [...] homeland or ours? We were planted here before the Prophet Abraham came, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like they [...] don't understand history or geography." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Dean of Faded Glamour {{believed}} that Strike Back [...] "remains {{pretty good at}} what it does—providing Sky viewers with their weekly Die Hard fix," [...] adding [...] "series two won't win any new converts, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> very much like {{it will continue to}} serve up the same pacey, unpretentious and unambiguous action as its predecessor." [...] Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated it 2.5 out of five. Foley felt the death of Porter in the first episode was [...] "striking" [...] since Armitage was the [...] "main reason for watching." [...] The reviewer also {{believed that}} while the first series [...] "offered a keen mix of Spooks and 24 that expertly blended top-drawer action with some emotional complexity and intrigue," [...] the second series [...] "already feels inferior to both by virtue of the fact that its brains appear to lie in its pants, or blown from Porter's head." [...] Keith Watson of Metro stated that Project Dawn was merely [...] "gung-ho nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|The artwork of Gunnerkrigg Court {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "stylized," [...] with simple character designs."What he did was make an intentional choice to make his characters very cartoony." [...] At least one reviewer, on the other hand, has noticed that the backgrounds, in contrast to the characters, are often very elaborate."His characters are really simple, and some of his backgrounds are really complicated." [...] The comic has also been described as having a [...] "rich" [...] look in spite of its limited color palette,"I love his use of color, too, in particular, because he never has more than like ten colors on the average page, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> really really rich." [...] and Siddell himself has stated that he first developed the idea for the comic using {{only a limited number of}} colors.Siddell: [...] "I did another sketch right after that of the same girl and, wanting to color it but only having a very limited selection of marker pens, put her in an ugly school uniform with some crazy makeup." [...] The pieces of artwork that Siddell has posted at the end of each printed book, entitled [...] "Treatise" [...] and [...] "Second Treatise," [...] demonstrate many such of Siddell's artistic and storytelling motifs: they integrate alchemical symbols, mythological figures, nature, and technology.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California. On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres THIS Wednesday on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{structure}} in subdomain 2 {{that is called}} the “D-loop” because it binds with DNase I, it is located between the His40 and Gly48 residues. It has {{the appearance of a}} disorderly element in the majority of crystals, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a β-sheet when it is complexed with DNase I. Domínguez “et al.” suggest that the key event in polymerization is probably the propagation of a conformational change from the centre of the bond with the nucleotide to this domain, which changes from a loop to a spiral. [...] However, this hypothesis has been refuted by other studies.|$|E
2500|$|There were 33 {{letters in}} Jaᶇalif; nine were for vowels. The {{apostrophe}} {{was used for}} the glottal stop (həmzə/hämzä) and was sometimes sorted as a letter. Other characters were also in use for foreign names. The small letter B looks like ʙ (to prevent confusion with Ь ь), and the capital letter Y looks like У. The letter Ꞑ ᶇ [...] ( [...] ) looks like N n/ŋ [...] which has a descender as in Cyrillic letters Щ, Җ, Ң. The letter no. 33 (similar to Zhuang Ƅ) isn't represented in Unicode, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> exactly like Cyrillic soft sign (Ь). Capital Ə also looks like Russian Э in some fonts.|$|E

2500|$|Gabriel grossed {{approximately}} [...] in its Australian opening week, ranking fifth at the Australian box office. Gabriel's opening week gross {{represented the}} second highest of an Australian-made film released in 2007, behind Rogue which opened the previous week with approximately A$667 000. In its opening weekend, Gabriel opened on 98 screens and averaged $4,797 per screen, the third highest per screen average of the top 20 grossing films for the weekend. The Age journalist Jim Schembri described Gabriel's opening week as [...] "impressive," [...] writing that [...] "The gloom-laden film may not be for all tastes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like it's hitting the right spots with its intended audience of goths, emos {{and people who have}} trouble sleeping at night." [...] In its five weeks playing in theaters, Gabriel grossed $1,462,320. Gabriels earnings ranked it at 110th among all the 295 films released in Australia in 2007.|$|E

60|$|Cole {{halted the}} Fixit cart and leaped {{down onto the}} pavement. He {{selected}} a house at random and approached it cautiously. The house was attractive. It had a certain simple beauty. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> frail--and exactly like the others.|$|R

50|$|On 11 April 2009 Leyton Orient beat Colchester United 2-1.
