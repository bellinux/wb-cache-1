5|$|A French-aligned Haitian general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E

5|$|A castle {{may have}} been {{constructed}} on Castle Island by 1257, when the 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time and were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, possibly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of William Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Amyntas III {{was forced}} to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383BC (based on {{conflicting}} accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis.

AmyntasIII was also nearly overthrown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E

Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E

5|$|For a time, Arsaces {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in Parthia and Hyrcania {{by taking advantage of}} the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by Ptolemy III Euergetes (r.246–222BC) of Egypt. This conflict with Ptolemy, the Third Syrian War (246–241BC), also allowed Diodotus I to rebel and form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia. The latter's successor, Diodotus II, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of Seleucus II Callinicus (r.246–225BC). After spending some time in exile among the nomadic Apasiacae tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, Antiochus III the Great (r.222–187BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of Molon in Media.|$|E

5|$|Former Viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{organized}} a counter-revolution in Córdoba, and this {{became the first}} military campaign of the independent government. Despite the importance of Liniers himself, and his prestige as a popular hero for his role when the British invaded, the population of Córdoba preferred to support the revolution. This reduced {{the power of the}} counter-revolutionary army by means of desertions and sabotage. Liniers's troops were quickly defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> led by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo. Ocampo refused to shoot the captive Liniers; hence the execution ordered by the Junta was carried out by Juan José Castelli. After the victory, the Primera Junta sent military expeditions to many other cities, to demand support and the election of representatives to it.|$|E
5|$|From October to November 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans, {{supported}} {{by both the}} Western Allies and the Soviet Union, and assisted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and two brigades of Albanian partisans, retook the region of Kosovo as the Germans withdrew. The area was reincorporated into the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. With no chance of victory, the withdrawing Germans helped Albanian collaborators escape the country as the communists drew closer. Many failed to escape and were executed by the communists upon capture. On 28 November 1944, the communist forces of Enver Hoxha emerged victorious in Albania. Hoxha subsequently implemented a totalitarian Stalinist government which banned all religions in the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{between these}} campaigns Rupert had visited his uncle's court in England. The Palatinate cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public {{subscription}} helped fund an expedition under Charles Louis to try and regain the electorate {{as part of a}} joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|In {{disputes}} {{prior to}} the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced {{with a series of}} towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malmö and Lübeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During {{the second half of the}} century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
