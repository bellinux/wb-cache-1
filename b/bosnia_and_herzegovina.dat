5|$|The Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> and Croatia {{was signed}} by Alija Izetbegović, President of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina,</b> and Franjo Tuđman, President of the Republic of Croatia, in Zagreb on 21 July 1992 during the Bosnian and Croatian wars for {{independence}} from Yugoslavia. It established cooperation, albeit inharmonious, between the two {{and served as a}} basis for joint defense against Serb forces. It also placed the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) under the command of the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH).|$|E
5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in the Bosnian War as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina,</b> supported by the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina,</b> shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b> It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b> This declaration would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, the Bosnian Serb army bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> faced the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations.|$|E
5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b> In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina,</b> most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> in early May, proclaimed {{cessation of hostilities}} between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased dramatically {{in the first few}} months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> were confronted by the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> to support the HVO.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{signing of}} the Split Agreementa mutual defence agreementby Tuđman and the President of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina,</b> Alija Izetbegović in Split on 22 July, {{permitting}} large-scale deployments of the HV in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b> Besides Tuđman and Izetbegović, the agreement was signed by President of the Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> Krešimir Zubak, and the Prime Minister of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> Haris Silajdžić. It was mediated by Demirel. The agreement specifically stated that Croatia requested urgent military aid, especially for the Bihać area, and that {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to coordinate their military activities. The full title of the Split Agreement, or Split Declaration, is Declaration on implementation of the Washington Agreement, joint defence against Serb aggression and achievement of a political solution in accordance with the efforts of the international community (Deklaracija o oživotvorenju Sporazuma iz Washingtona, zajedničkoj obrani od srpske agresije i postizanju političkog rješenja sukladno naporima međunarodne zajednice).|$|E

On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> {{happened on}} a larger scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina,</b> just as each was {{fighting with the}} Bosnian Serbs. The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July, the RSK and the VRS militaries started Operation Sword-95, a push {{to capture}} Bihać by {{expanding}} on gains made during Operation Spider. The move provided the HV {{with a chance}} to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter '94 by advancing from the Livno Valley. On 22 July, President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman and President of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> Alija Izetbegović signed the Split Agreement on mutual defence, permitting the large-scale deployment of the HV in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b>|$|E
