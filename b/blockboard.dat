40|$|As a large {{producer}} and consumer of wood building materials, China suffers product formaldehyde emissions (PFE) but lacks systematic investigations and basic data on Chinese standard emission tests (CST), so {{this paper presented}} a first effort on this issue. The PFE of fiberboards, particleboards, <b>blockboards,</b> floorings, and parquets manufactured in Beijing region were characterized by the perforator extraction method (PE), 9 - 11 L and 40 L desiccator methods (D 9, D 40), and environmental chamber method (EC) of the Chinese national standard GB 18580; based on statistics of PFE data, measurement uncertainties in CST were evaluated by the Monte Carlo method; moreover, PFE data correlations between tests were established. Results showed: (1) Different tests may give slightly different evaluations on product quality. In PE and D 9 tests, <b>blockboards</b> and parquets reached E 1 grade for PFE, which can be directly used in indoor environment; but in D 40 and EC tests, floorings and parquets achieved E 1. (2) In multiple tests, PFE data characterized by PE, D 9, and D 40 complied with Gaussian distributions, while those characterized by EC followed log-normal distributions. Uncertainties in CST were overall low, with uncertainties for 20 material-method combinations all below 7. 5 %, and the average uncertainty for each method under 3. 5 %, thus being acceptable in engineering application. A more complicated material structure and a larger test scale caused higher uncertainties. (3) Conventional linear models applied to correlating PFE values between PE, D 9, and EC, with R 2 all over 0. 840, while novel logarithmic (exponential) models can work better for correlations involving D 40, with R 2 all beyond 0. 901. This research preliminarily demonstrated the effectiveness of CST, where results for D 40 presented greater similarities to EC-the currently most reliable test for PFE, thus highlighting the potential of Chinese D 40 as a more practical approach in production control and risk assessment...|$|R

50|$|Until {{the mid-1950s}} {{it was widely}} {{considered}} vulgar and pretentious to frame a photograph for a gallery exhibition. Prints were usually simply pasted onto <b>blockboard</b> or plywood, or given a white border in the darkroom and then pinned at the corners onto display boards. Prints were thus shown without any glass reflections obscuring them. Steichen's famous The Family of Man exhibition was unframed, the pictures pasted to panels. Even as late as 1966 Bill Brandt's MoMA show was unframed, with simple prints pasted to thin plywood. From the mid-1950s to about 2000 most gallery exhibitions had prints behind glass. Since about 2000 {{there has been a}} noticeable move toward once again showing contemporary gallery prints on boards and without glass.

Since <b>blockboard</b> is not well known in China and the free market only became officially effective for the wood industry in Heilongjiang Province {{at the end of the}} project (November 1992), it is recommended that a marketing study for <b>blockboard</b> be formulated before the plant reaches full production. To assist the Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory in this new task, it is suggested that links with the Chinese Research Institute of the Wood Industry (CRIWI) be strengthened in order {{to establish a}} sound marketing strategy and to implement it. CRIWI could serve as a promoter of <b>blockboard</b> to other parts of the country, and assure the dissemination of information about the <b>blockboard</b> production unit at Xinqing in order to attract other investors or entrepreneurs. Since the <b>blockboard</b> production unit will consume only a part of the wood waste generated by the Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory, it is recommended that XTMPF create alternative products (other than <b>blockboard)</b> by developing items from ordinary timber, i. e. flooring, laminated furniture, laminated parquet, collapsible boxes, tooth picks, chopsticks, etc. Furthermore, maximizing the use of the existing wood drying kilns would enable kiln-dried wood to be sold at a higher price to local craftsmen who are always in need of dry wood for furniture making and other purposes. In conclusion, it was felt that the project had achieved its objectives. It is hoped that these achievements may enable Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory to obtain full industrial production of good quality <b>blockboard</b> in the near future...|$|E

The strains that milling machines and planer head with reversible knives suffered were measured by an amperemeter using an experimental mechanism with six different wood-based panels, three different engine revolution speeds (rev/min), and three drive forward speeds (m/min). Using the experimental data and the data derived from wood-based panels, engine revolution speed, and drive forward speed, several regression equations were developed in order to anticipate probable strains {{for each of the}} wood-based panels. As a consequence, the utmost strains observed on machinery during planing were caused by okoume plywood, followed by MDF, OSB, particleboard, <b>blockboard,</b> and poplar plywood in decreasing order of intensity. It was also observed that the spent current values (A) increased during planing in which engine revolution speed and drive forward speed are always kept high. It was also clearly seen that the wood-based panels were more resistant to the machinery and the knives when they were operated at higher speeds.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to study the mechanical properties of recovered solid wood and wood-based materials, to create new panels made of strips of recovered oak and spruce wood, particleboards and blockboards and to study their mechanical properties, feasibility and use. Flatness, MOR and MOE were determined for the solid wood and wood-based materials recovered from construction and demolition sites. Four types of experimental panels (PL 1, PL 2, PALL 1 and PALL 2) were manufactured from solid wood strips alternating with either particleboard or <b>blockboard</b> strips glued edge to edge. Some of their physical and mechanical properties were investigated. All new panels made from recovered materials fell within allowable limits specified in European standard requirements for panel flatness. Panels type PL 2, PALL 1 and PALL 2 show better values for MoR and MoE parallel to the grain {{when compared to the}} respective values for the recovered wood-based materials of which they are made, but panels type PL 1 show no change. Panels type PALL 2 are preferable to panels type PALL 1 due to better mechanical properties. Panels type PL 1 and PL 2 show no such differences in their structure.
