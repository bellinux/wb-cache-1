5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> easy to repel.|$|E

25|$|While several {{third-party}} projects (e.g. GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony) created {{free software}} partial Java implementations, the large {{size of the}} Sun libraries combined {{with the use of}} clean room methods meant that their implementations of the Java libraries (the compiler and VM are comparatively small and well defined) were incomplete and not fully compatible.

25|$|The XOR metric allows Kademlia {{to extend}} routing tables beyond single bits. Groups of bits {{can be placed}} in k-buckets. The group of bits are termed a prefix. For an m-bit prefix, there will be 2m-1 k-buckets. The missing k-bucket is a further {{extension}} of the routing tree that contains the node ID. An m-bit prefix reduces {{the maximum number of}} lookups from log2 n to log2m n. These are maximum values and the average value will <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less,</b> increasing the chance of finding a node in a k-bucket that shares more bits than just the prefix with the target key.|$|E
25|$|Taking to {{the field}} on 13 November 1932, the {{military}} found a degree of success over the first two days, with approximately 40 emus killed. The third day, 15 November, proved to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> successful, but by 2 December the guns were accounting for approximately 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10 December, and in his report he claimed 986 kills with 9,860 rounds, {{at a rate of}} exactly 10 rounds per confirmed kill. In addition, Meredith claimed 2,500 wounded birds had {{died as a result of}} the injuries that they had sustained.|$|E
25|$|Surge - is {{the point}} at which the {{compressor}} cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance or backpressure. This causes a rapid flow reversal (i.e., surge). As a result, high vibration, temperature increases, and rapid changes in axial thrust can occur. These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor driver and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may be very durable, the cycles/processes that they are used within can <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> robust.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of that}} investigation, Transit {{considered}} {{whether it}} would have been worthwhile to toll new capacity to assist in funding its construction. This could have been in the form of tolling the new lanes along this route, which would have ensured an untolled alternative was available (as legally required), while the tolled new lanes would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> congested. In mid 2007, Transit indicated that it would not seek a decision on funding the bridge via road tolls before starting work on construction. Auckland Airport had accused Transit of threatening to defer the project if it could not gain backing from the public and local Councils. As the bridge was to be finished for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, further delays would possibly have resulted in the bridge not being completed in time.|$|E
25|$|The New Voice group, however, {{understood}} that their {{only hope for}} success was to move the debate out of the executive council. In the executive council, each union—no matter how small—had an equal vote. A group of 20 small unions could make binding decisions even though their membership might <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> than that of their opponents. But at the AFL-CIO convention, each union was allotted delegates proportional {{to the size of}} its membership. At the convention, a coalition of large unions could triumph even if they did not represent a majority of unions. It would have been foolish for the New Voice slate, whose base was in some of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO, to pursue their goals in the executive council where their votes counted for less.|$|E

Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize, only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only a snapshot of the process of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which will never demonstrate an exact half-way point.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} and {{improvements to the}} basic Dickson charge pump. [...] Many of these are concerned with reducing {{the effect of the}} transistor drain-source voltage. [...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>less</b> than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. [...] However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.Yuan, 14-21 ...|$|E
