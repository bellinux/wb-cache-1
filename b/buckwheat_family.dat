5000|$|Polygonum is a genus {{of about}} 220 species of {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} <b>buckwheat</b> and knotweed <b>family</b> Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed, knotgrass, bistort, tearthumb, mile-a-minute, smartweed and several others. In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita ( [...] 1400-1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes {{been included in the}} genus as Polygonum fagopyrum.|$|R
5000|$|Plants that {{contribute}} to nitrogen fixation include the legume family [...] - [...] Fabaceae [...] - [...] with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa, lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within the nodules, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants and this helps to fertilize the soil. The great majority of legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., Styphnolobium) do not. In many traditional and organic farming practices, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually includes one consisting mainly or entirely of clover or <b>buckwheat</b> (non-legume <b>family</b> Polygonaceae), which are {{often referred to as}} [...] "green manure".|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies show}} that pollen resides in the {{intestinal}} tract {{for a minimum of}} seven days to at least 21 days. Because of this long residence time, pollen analysis is an important avenue of forensic research. Pollen provides evidence of the environment of the decedent as well as foods and medicine. We analyzed a coprolite recovered from a Korean mummy. The decedent was a high-ranking general who lived during the 16 th or 17 th centuries. Twenty pollen types were recovered. These ranged from 100 s to 10, 000 s of pollen grains per gram of coprolite. Importantly, comparison of the coprolite pollen spectrum to modern aeropalynology studies of Korea suggests that the general died in winter between middle November to late February. Economic pollen types were most abundant. Economic refers to dietary, medicinal, spice, and beverage types. Dietary pollen types include pollen from Oryza (rice), Eriogonum (<b>buckwheat),</b> Brassicaceae (mustard <b>family),</b> and Solanaceae (tomato-chile pepper family). Pollen consistent with dandelion is present and may represent its use as food. Tens of thousands of grains from water plants, bur-reed or cattail, dominate the pollen spectrum. We believe that this was introduced with water. The large numbers of water-related pollen suggest that the general consumed broth, tea, or soup for a considerable time before death...|$|R
