It was very certain {{to me that they}} had run from London without stopping, and I felt an intense curiosity as to their destination. However, I said no more to them. I made my adieux to Delora, and bowed profoundly to the Chinese ambassador, who opened his eyes in time solemnly to return my farewell. The chauffeur was already in his place, and I stopped to speak to him. I saw Delora spring forward and whistle down the speaking-tube, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> was already asked.|$|E

60|$|This resistance, whereby {{it keeps}} other bodies {{out of the}} space which it possesses, is so great, that no force, how great soever, can surmount it. All the bodies in the world, {{pressing}} {{a drop of water}} on all sides, {{will never be able to}} overcome the resistance which it will make, soft as it is, to their approaching one another, till it be removed out of their way: whereby our idea of solidity is distinguished both from pure space, which is capable neither of resistance nor motion; and from the ordinary idea of hardness. For a man may conceive two bodies at a distance, so as they may approach one another, without touching or displacing any solid thing, till their superficies come to meet; whereby, I think, we have the clear idea of space without solidity. For (not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body) I ask, whether a man cannot have the idea of the motion of one single body alone, without any other succeeding immediately into its place? I think it is evident he can: the idea of motion in one body no more including the idea of motion in another, than the idea of a square figure in one body includes the idea of a square figure in another. I do not ask, whether bodies do so EXIST, that the motion of one body cannot really be without the motion of another. To determine this either way, is to beg the question for or against a VACUUM. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is,--whether one cannot have the IDEA of one body moved, whilst others are at rest? And I think this no one will deny. If so, then the place it deserted gives us the idea of pure space without solidity; whereinto any other body may enter, without either resistance or protrusion of anything. When the sucker in a pump is drawn, the space it filled in the tube is certainly the same whether any other body follows the motion of the sucker or not: nor does it imply a contradiction that, upon the motion of one body, another that is only contiguous to it should not follow it. The necessity of such a motion is built only on the supposition that the world is full; but not on the distinct IDEAS of space and solidity, which are as different as resistance and not resistance, protrusion and not protrusion. And that men have ideas of space without a body, their very disputes about a vacuum plainly demonstrate, as is shown in another place.|$|E

3000|$|An {{interesting}} point {{in that regard}} is whether {{the powers of the}} sanction of the architect, the chef and the artist are absolute and, in any case, alike. Has a cook the power to make her culinary work constitutively X-specific? Certainly one can make a culinary work de facto site- or time-specific by requiring some perishable location-specific (geographical indications), 17 or seasonal, food products as essential ingredients for its preparation; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is rather whether Marchesi had the power to arbitrarily decree that Dripping of Fishi can only exist in Milan (hence, not merely in Il Marchesino) or, maybe, in a stormy night, in winter time, or during the Pontificate of Joseph Ratzinger (2005 – 2013). The same questions can be raised for architecture. Has the architect the unquestionable power to establish that her work can only exist for a three-year lifespan, or if the building is plant-covered or inhabited by a certain kind of people?

40|$|Along the time, {{enterprises}} {{were created}} as economic entities meant to supply {{goods and services}} {{to the members of}} society. Profit is the main incentive for entrepreneurs. First, the enterprise was the basic economic unit form for our society. Therefore, its main role was to produce the goods and services necessary to consumers and to achieve an acceptable profit along that process. At some point, the profit seen as incentive changed into the concept of maximum profits, the one that lasted until now. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> crucial <b>question</b> is: to what extent should a company pursue the profit?

40|$|A {{group of}} elderly and retired women from a {{northern}} village in Spain (they call themselves las chicas, the girls), try gather every week {{to take a}} walk together. Assembling my ethnographic notes, I describe the walk and offer an analytical foray into the following questions: What can we learn about the rural and the relationship of these women with the rural? What is the specificity of walking here? Walking is a practice that has in this case a twofold capacity: walking creates a mobile space for visibility in in which rural women’s work is considered private, and thus, walking provides a precious inter-subjective space for relationality; and second, the walk enacts a particular archaeology of memoir. The landscape bears witness to the socioeconomic changes of the rural environment. Such memoirs are actualized in the walk. Finally, as las chicas walk, not only do they travel across space and time, their movement allows for a particular methodological engagement of the researcher with the methods of research. Mobilities often question what hinders mobilities. <b>But</b> here <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is, what is the walking telling us about both the rural and these women in the rural context...|$|R

40|$|This short note {{is aimed}} to open discussion. Asset pricing models assume capital markets are competitive, <b>but</b> then <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> were: Why would a diversified {{investor}} {{be willing to}} accept a supposedly lower equilibrium risk adjusted rate of return in emerging markets (like Argentina), that the one sought from a foreign investor, being both comfortable with it? The second: Do the sale of securities and finance in general benefit from, applying concepts and tools borrowed from consumer theory and particularly demand theory? Finally: May companies benefit from some sort of market power when selling risk to investors in the form of securities (particularly shares), in the same way they may benefit from holding market power for their products and services? The purpose of this short note is to share debate about the assumption of competitive markets in the determination of the equilibrium risk adjusted rate of return, which could become more interesting in emerging markets where lack of depth of capital markets, lack of information and lack of sophistication are more plausible to find giving rise to the possibility of sort of market power in the sale of risk, and to perhaps introduce some points of contact between the consumer theory -particularly demand and marketing (which holds for consumption of current products and services), to securities (particularly in this note herein shares) which are no more than packed rights for future consumption. However, concepts may apply to developed capital markets where companies want to promote not only their products and services, but also their shares...|$|R

40|$|What distinguishes full-on stating a {{proposition}} from merely communicating it? For instance, what distinguishes claiming/asserting/saying {{that one has}} never smoked crack cocaine from merely implying/conveying/hinting this? The enormous literature on ‘assertion’ provides many approaches to distinguishing stating from, say, asking and commanding: only the former aims at truth; only the former expresses one’s belief; etc. <b>But</b> this leaves <b>my</b> <b>question</b> unanswered, since in merely communicating {{a proposition}} one also aims at truth, expresses a belief, etc. 	My aim is not to criticize extant accounts of the state-vs. -merely-convey contrast, but rather to draw on clues from Dummett, functional linguistics and moral theory, to offer a novel one. The main idea is that full-on stating is distinctively conventionalized {{in a way that}} conversationally implicating, hinting, giving to understand, etc., are not. Specifically, full-on stating is constitutively tied to a particular conventional, linguistic, function-bearing device, the declarative sentence. To full-on state that p is to hit that ‘target speech act’ which owes its existence to that special-purpose device. It is therefore also to make one’s action lie-prone. Nonetheless, once that sui generis target is there to be aimed for, a person may reach it without using the special-purpose tool – e. g., one may full-on state using a mere word or phrase, or coded hand signals, or semaphore. 	I end by considering several philosophical implications of this means of capturing the contrast...|$|R
