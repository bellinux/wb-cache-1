40|$|To gain {{further insight}} into {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) -action of beta-adrenergic {{blocking}} agents (<b>beta-blockers),</b> we examined the effects of various kinds of <b>beta-blockers</b> on opioid receptors (Op-Rs) using radiolabeled receptor assay (RRA). We demonstrated that <b>beta-blockers</b> are competitively bound to Op-Rs in the CNS. Sodium index of <b>beta-blockers</b> in [3 H]naloxone binding study indicated that <b>beta-blockers</b> had the mixed agonist-antagonist activity of opiates. The relative potency of <b>beta-blockers</b> in opioid RRA was negatively correlated with their membrane stabilizing activity. Neither beta-blocking activity nor intrinsic sympathomimetic activity was correlated with IC 50 values of <b>beta-blockers</b> in opioid RRA. While it is widely accepted that <b>beta-blockers</b> have a tranquilizing activity, a part of the tranquilizing action of <b>beta-blockers</b> may be mediated through Op-Rs in the CNS. Although <b>beta-blockers</b> may have effects on their own receptors (beta-receptors) in the CNS, the more precise mechanisms of central action of these drugs must be further investigated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Convincing {{evidence}} {{of the decline of}} mortality has been achieved with <b>beta-blockers</b> in patients with an acute myocardial infarction and in post-infarction follow-up. The <b>beta-blockers</b> are also the most efficient antianginal medications for the decrease of ischemia in outpatients. They are highly efficient as a monotherapy for angina and are also a medication of choice for angina after the coronary. The objective of this work was an estimate of the use of <b>beta-blockers</b> in secondary prevention of the ischemic heart disease and eliminating doubts concerning their prescription. The method of the analysis sums up the results of a twenty-five- year study on of the outcome of the treatment with <b>beta-blockers</b> in secondary prevention of the ischemic heart disease. The method of the work implies an examination of the professional literature and the data-bases, such as MEDLINE, PubMed and KOBSON. The first studies concerned non-selective <b>beta-blockers,</b> used orally. The following studies concerned cardioselective <b>beta-blockers,</b> metoprolol and atenolol. Several studies followed also the effect of <b>beta-blockers</b> and heparin, or <b>beta-blockers</b> and antagonists of calcium towards placebo, in patients with an unstable angina pectoris. <b>Beta-blockers</b> are an essential drug in secondary prevention of the myocardial infarction and in chronic heart failure. The necessary condition for the efficiency of <b>beta-blockers</b> is an early use. <b>Beta-blockers</b> should be given within 12 hours after the appearance of pain. The continuation of the therapy with <b>beta-blockers</b> after the acute phase is considered to be important in the decrease of the infarction zone expansion. Prophylactic use of <b>beta-blockers</b> after the coronary has an excellent effect, above all in patients with a minor, uncomplicated coronary. Though certain groups of <b>beta-blockers</b> have some special characteristics, {{when it comes to the}} treatment of angina pectoris, all <b>beta-blockers</b> are efficient. Generally, patients react well to them. Preference is given to cardioselective remedies, in patients with diabetes or lung disease. Exhaustive controlled clinical studies affirm <b>beta-blockers</b> as drugs that reduce mortality in secondary prevention of the ischemic heart disease...|$|R

40|$|Until National Institute Guidelines for Health and Clinical Excellence of 2006 were published, {{there was}} a general {{consensus}} on major hypertension guidelines as to <b>beta-blockers</b> being used as first-line treatment in uncomplicated hypertension.

40|$|Background: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} (ED) frequently precedes {{cardiovascular diseases}} (CVD) {{and is a}} well-established risk factor of major adverse cardiac events. <b>Beta-blockers</b> are the fundamental drugs used in CVD treatment. Methods: A systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials investigating influ-ence of <b>beta-blockers</b> on endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was performed in the PubMed and Cochrane Databases. Results: Sixteen full-text studies involving a total of 1, 273 patients {{were included in the}} final analysis. The mean age of participating patients ranged from 44. 9 to 63. 2 years, the follow-up duration from 1 to 12 months.

50|$|Since β2 {{adrenergic}} receptors {{can cause}} vascular smooth muscle dilation <b>beta-blockers</b> may cause some vasoconstriction. However, this effect {{tends to be}} small because the activity of β2 receptors is overshadowed by the more dominant vasoconstricting α1 receptors.

40|$|<b>Beta-blockers</b> {{substantially}} improve {{survival in}} chronic heart failure and after myocardial infarction. However, concern about side-effects may deter clinicians from prescribing these life-saving drugs. In reality, absolute contraindications are rare. Only 3 – 5 % of patients are intolerant because of hypotension or bradycardia. Data from randomized controlled trials and retrospective {{studies show that}} most patients eligible to receive <b>beta-blockers</b> tolerate them well. <b>Beta-blockers</b> are not contraindicated in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD); in fact, these patients also benefit because of their high cardiovascular risk. In patients with COPD, as in the elderly, <b>beta-blockers</b> should be started at a low dose and uptitrated slowly. Monitoring of lung function during initiation is important, as undiagnosed coexistent asthma could be revealed. When patients are unaware of the drug in use, erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported no more often with <b>beta-blockers</b> than with any other drug prescribed for heart failure or hypertension. However, when patients are aware of the potential side-effects of <b>beta-blockers,</b> the resultant anxiety may cause ED.

40|$|Single-dose {{administration}} of beta-adrenoceptor agonists produces bronchodilation and inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), {{and is the}} standard treatment for the acute relief of asthma. However, chronic repetitive {{administration of}} beta-adrenoceptor agonists may increase AHR, airway inflammation, and risk of death. Based upon the paradigm shift that occurred {{with the use of}} <b>beta-blockers</b> in congestive heart failure, we previously determined that chronic administration of <b>beta-blockers</b> decreased AHR in a murine model of asthma. To elucidate the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of <b>beta-blockers,</b> we examined the effects of chronic administration of several beta-adrenoceptor ligands in a murine model of allergic asthma. Administration of <b>beta-blockers</b> resulted in a reduction in total cell counts, eosinophils, and the cytokines IL- 13, IL- 10, IL- 5, and TGF-β 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage, and attenuated epithelial mucin content and morphologic changes. The differences in mucin content also occurred if the <b>beta-blockers</b> were administered only during the ovalbumin challenge phase, but administration of <b>beta-blockers</b> for 7 days was not as effective as administration for 28 days. These results indicate that in a murine model of asthma, chronic administration of <b>beta-blockers</b> reduces inflammation and mucous metaplasia, cardinal features of asthma that may contribute to airflow obstruction and AHR.

In this study we evaluated in vivo the effects of nebivolol on airway responsiveness compared to atenolol, pindolol, and propranolol. In New Zealand white rabbits total lung resistance (R(L)) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were calculated.

Furthermore, the changes induced by <b>beta-blockers</b> (higher doses) in R(L) and Cdyn after a treatment with salbutamol were calculated. In acute treatment, airway responsiveness to histamine was not modified by nebivolol at any dosage, but increased significantly following the exposure to the higher doses of the other <b>beta-blockers.</b> In chronic treatment, the thirty-day exposure to nebivolol, did not modify the airway responsiveness to histamine, whereas the other <b>beta-blockers</b> significantly increased airway responsiveness. Moreover, nebivolol affected the salbutamol-induced relaxation less markedly than other <b>beta-blockers</b> do. These data demonstrate that nebivolol respect the other <b>beta-blockers</b> used in this study, does not significantly affect the airway responsiveness, therefore it could be used in patients with both cardiovascular and bronchial diseases more safely than other <b>beta-blockers</b> drugs...|$|R
