Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the ride in 2001, {{which was based on}} a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain Blackheart.|$|E
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, Rockefeller {{expanded}} into iron ore and ore transportation, forcing {{a collision with}} steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and their competition became a major subject of the newspapers and cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out. Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> retirement. The daily management of the trust {{was turned over to}} John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E

5|$|Harry K. Danziger succeeded Wax as rabbi in 1978. The {{son of a}} rabbi, Danziger was a {{graduate}} of the University of Cincinnati, and ordained by the HUC. He joined Temple Israel as assistant rabbi in 1964, but in 1969 moved to Monroe, Louisiana, to lead Congregation B'nai Israel. He was replaced first by Howard Schwartz, then by Richard Birnholz. Birnholz tendered his resignation in 1973, and Wax <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> retirement. Danziger, then at Baltimore's Temple Oheb Shalom, was approached as Wax's successor, and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi. Synagogue membership had been around 1,350 families from the mid-1960s, but increased after the move to East Massey Road. By Wax's retirement it had reached around 1,500, and over half Memphis's 10,000 Jews were members of Temple Israel.|$|E
5|$|Immersed in the university's violent gang culture, in 1947 he {{took part}} in a quashed attempt to {{overthrow}} the military junta of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. Returning to student politics, Castro was involved with violent demonstrations in which protesters clashed with riot police, at which he became increasingly left-wing in his views. Traveling to Bogotá, Colombia, he fought for the Liberals in the Bogotazo before returning to Havana, where he embraced Marxism. In 1948 he married the wealthy Mirta Díaz Balart, and in September 1949 their son Fidelito was born. Obtaining his Doctorate of Law in September 1950, he co-opened an unsuccessful law firm before entering parliamentary politics as a Partido Ortodoxo candidate. When General Fulgencio Batista launched a coup and overthrew the elected presidency, Castro brought legal challenges against him, but as this proved ineffective, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> other ways to oust Batista.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{was dismayed}} by Spencer's decision, and {{declared}} that he would rather have received no title {{than that of a}} mere barony. He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of Naples, the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and the comforts he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite enjoying his lifestyle in Naples, Nelson <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> returning to England, but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, {{during the}} First World War, South African forces invaded and the {{following}} year an Anglican priest, Nelson Fogarty, established the first Anglican presence, initially to minister to the South African troops and civilians who had followed the military occupation.

25|$|The idea of freely debating {{rights to}} {{political}} representation took form during the Putney Debates of 1647.

John Locke (1632–1704), one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers, argued that property - which to him included life, liberty and possessions - was an unalienable human right, that is, one which cannot be taken away. He articulated that every person is created equal and free but, in return for the advantages of living in an organised society, a person may need to give up some of this freedom.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s Gardner's {{activities}} {{had moved from}} those exclusively of a civil servant, and he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> himself more as a folklorist, archaeologist and anthropologist. He was encouraged in this by {{the director of the}} Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) and by his election to Fellowship of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1936. En route back to London in 1932 Gardner stopped off in Egypt and, armed with a letter of introduction, joined Sir Flinders Petrie who was excavating the site of Tall al-Ajjul in Palestine. Arriving in London in August 1932 he attended a conference on prehistory and protohistory at King's College London, attending at least two lectures which described the cult of the Mother Goddess. He also befriended the archaeologist and practising Pagan Alexander Keiller, known for his excavations at Avebury, who would encourage Gardner to join in with the excavations at Hembury Hill in Devon, also attended by Aileen Fox and Mary Leakey.|$|E
25|$|After a furore {{in which}} the {{eccentric}} John Brande Morris preached for him in St Mary's in September 1839, Newman <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> moving away from Oxford. One plan that surfaced was {{to set up a}} religious community in Littlemore, outside the city of Oxford. Since accepting his post at St. Mary's, Newman had a chapel (dedicated to Sts. Nicholas and Mary) and school built in the parish's neglected area. Newman's mother had laid the foundation stone in 1835, based on a half-acre plot and £100 given by Oriel College. Newman planned to appoint Charles Pourtales Golightly, an Oriel man, as curate at Littlemore in 1836. However, Golightly had taken offence at one of Newman's sermons, and joined a group of aggressive anti-Catholics. Thus, Isaac Williams became Littlemore's curate instead, succeeded by John Rouse Bloxam from 1837 to 1840, during which the school opened. William John Copeland acted as curate from 1840.|$|E
500|$|... "MH 4.18.2011" [...] was {{a working}} title {{for a song}} {{that was to be}} named [...] "Hold On", and {{represents}} a combination of Hoppus' initials and the date he wrote the song. However, DeLonge convinced Hoppus to keep the original title because he thought it sounded cool, likening it to a virus. The song was inspired by one occasion in which Hoppus was idle at a stoplight when a helicopter flew over ahead, casting a large shadow. He <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> war-torn countries and impoverished areas in which circling helicopters are a [...] "way of life," [...] and wrote the song to capture that mentality. [...] "Love Is Dangerous" [...] arose from a minimalist, electronic ballad, but gradually took on a heavier sound when combined with guitars. Hoppus described [...] "Fighting the Gravity" [...] as a [...] "very strange song," [...] and highlighted its production: he ran a drum machine through his bass amp, and when the volume was turned up, it shook the entire building, causing a light fixture in the control room to start shaking. Hoppus and Holmes mic-ed up the fixture, creating the rattling heard near the beginning. [...] "Even If She Falls" [...] is an upbeat, [...] "catchy love song," [...] that Hoppus viewed as a positive note to end the record on.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, Christgau {{stated that}} {{although}} few critics agreed with Goldstein {{at the time}} of his negative contemporary review, many later came to appreciate his sentiments. In the opinion of Lester Bangs – the so-called [...] "godfather" [...] of punk rock journalism, also writing in 1981 – [...] "Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll." [...] He notes: [...] "In the sixties rock and roll <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> itself as an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts." [...] The musicologist John Kimsey cites the preservation of authenticity as a guiding tenet of rock music and suggests that many purists denounce Sgt. Pepper in that respect, accusing the album of [...] "mark a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness." [...] In his opinion, detractors regard the LP as less a breakthrough and more a [...] "break with all that's good, true and rocking". According to Christgau: [...] "Although Sgt. Pepper is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous. In retrospect it seems peculiarly apollonian – precise, controlled, even stiff – and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream". In Moore's estimation, [...] "because its cultural impact was so large, it was simply being asked to do too much." ...|$|E
500|$|During the American Civil War, Gray was a steadfast {{supporter}} of the North and the Republican Party. About February 1861two months before the war started, Gray lost part of his left thumb, just above {{the base of the}} nail, in an accident in the garden. Despite now being 50 years old, he regretted that this accident ended his [...] "fighting days". After hostilities began, he joined a company that guarded the Massachusetts State Arsenal in Cambridge. He also bought war bonds, was surprised more people did not do likewise, and supported a 5%tax to support the war. Gray regretted not having children because he had [...] "no son to send to the war". Gray considered Abraham Lincoln as a second George Washington {{because of the way he}} managed to preserve the Union during the war. He also predicted that the fate of slavery depended upon the length and bitterness of the war, and the longer it lasted the more disastrous it would be for the South. As a corollary, he felt that if the South had given up early in the war, they would have had a chance of preserving slavery longer. Regarding his botanical endeavors, the war sundered his supply of information and specimens from the South. Even the Southern botanists who supported the North, such as Alvan Wentworth Chapman and Thomas Minott Peters, were soon forced to cease communications with Gray. It was during the war that Gray first <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> retiring from his professorial duties so he could concentrate on completing Flora of North America.|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{enduring}} folklore of the Titanic sinking {{is that the}} musicians played the hymn [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee" [...] as the ship sank, but {{this appears to be}} dubious. The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking, and the hymn became so closely associated with the Titanic disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of Titanics bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished. Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played. In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then [...] "Autumn", by which he may have meant Archibald Joyce's then-popular waltz [...] "Songe d'Automne" [...] (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, Carpathia, who spoke with survivors, related: [...] "The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After Titanic struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs– anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken... various awe-stricken passengers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'." [...] According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were [...] "cheerful" [...] but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper [...] "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic." [...] Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: [...] "I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. The next time I passed where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen." ...|$|E
