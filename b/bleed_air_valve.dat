The Mi-17 can be recognized {{because it has}} the tail rotor {{on the port side}} instead of the starboard side, and dust shields in front of the engine intakes.

40|$|Aircraft {{flying in}} regions of high ice crystal {{concentrations}} {{are susceptible to}} the buildup of ice within the compression system of their gas turbine engines. This ice buildup can restrict engine airflow and cause an uncommanded loss of thrust, also known as engine rollback, which poses a potential safety hazard. The aviation community is conducting research to understand this phenomena, and to identify avoidance and mitigation strategies to address the concern. To support this research, a dynamic turbofan engine model has been created to enable the development and evaluation of engine icing detection and control-based mitigation strategies. This model captures the dynamic engine response due to high ice water ingestion and the buildup of ice blockage in the engines low pressure compressor. It includes a fuel control system allowing engine closed-loop control effects during engine icing events to be emulated. The model also includes <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> and horsepower extraction actuators that, when modulated, change overall engine operating performance. This system-level model has been developed and compared against test data acquired from an aircraft turbofan engine undergoing engine icing studies in an altitude test facility and also against outputs from the manufacturers customer deck. This paper will describe the model and show results of its dynamic response under open-loop and closed-loop control operating scenarios {{in the presence of}} ice blockage buildup compared against engine test cell data. Planned follow-on use of the model for the development and evaluation of icing detection and control-based mitigation strategies will also be discussed. The intent is to combine the model and control mitigation logic with an engine icing risk calculation tool capable of predicting the risk of engine icing based on current operating conditions. Upon detection of an operating region of risk for engine icing events, the control mitigation logic will seek to change the engines operating point to a region of lower risk through the modulation of available control actuators while maintaining the desired engine thrust output. Follow-on work will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of such control-based mitigation strategies...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air, registration VH-SKC, serial number BB-47, manufactured in 1975.

50|$|The 1971 January 22 Surgut Aeroflot Antonov An-12 crash {{occurred}} on 22 January 1971, when an Aeroflot Antonov An-12B, registered CCCP-11000, flying from Omsk Tsentralny Airport, in the Soviet Unions Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR), crashed 15 km {{short of the}} runway on approach to Surgut International Airport, Surgut, RSFSR.

5000|$|Pressurization is {{achieved}} by the design of an airtight fuselage engineered to be pressurized with a source of compressed air and controlled by an environmental control system (ECS). The most common source of compressed air for pressurization is <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> extracted from the compressor stage of a gas turbine engine, from a low or intermediate stage and also from an additional high stage; the exact stage can vary depending on engine type. By the time the cold outside air has reached the <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves,</b> it is {{at a very high}} pressure and has been heated to around [...] The control and selection of high or low bleed sources is fully automatic and is governed by the needs of various pneumatic systems at various stages of flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was {{determined}} to be a stall caused by the leading edge slats (strictly speaking, Krueger flaps) having been left in the retracted position. Even though the trailing edge flaps were deployed, without the slats being extended the aircraft's stall speed was higher and the maximum angle of attack was lower. As a result, the aircraft was unable to climb out of ground effect. The flight engineer was found to have failed to open the slat system <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> as required on the pre-flight checklist. This prevented <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from flowing to the 747's pneumatic slat system and, since the leading edge slats on the 747 are pneumatically driven, kept it from deploying the leading edge slats for takeoff. The take-off warning system that would have sounded an alarm due to the flaps not being lowered did not have a separate warning that the slats' pneumatic valve had not been opened by the flight engineer.|$|R

This detection is shown through progressive changes, particularly in the high-frequency content, as a function of exposure to greater cumulative quantities of ash. Additionally, detection of the simulated failure of the 14 th stage stability bleed valve and, to a lesser extent, the station 2. 5 stability bleed valve, to their fully-open fail-safe positions was achieved by means of spectral comparisons between nominal (normal valve operation) and seeded fault scenarios...|$|R

To find the combustion temperature characteristics, the combustor is divided into several zones. The temperature for each zone is calculated by applying an energy balance. To predict NOx and CO, several correlations explored by various researchers are used and compared against each other, using the calculated temperatures, pressures and equivalence ratios. A comparison between collected emissions examples from a turbine test cell data spreadsheet and predicted emissions by the developed model under the same conditions show a highly accurate match for NOx emission at any load. Because of the high variation of CO at part load, the model predictions only match the CO data set at full load...|$|R

The rotating disk of the turbine then flew from the starter's compartment and entered the engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines.

The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of flames on the engine no 2. The engine no 2 burst into flames.|$|R

50|$|Various {{devices such}} as manual and {{automatic}} air vents are used to address free air which floats up to the high points throughout the system.

When water reaches (fills) the valve, the float lifts, blocking the water from escaping. Small (domestic) versions of these valves in older systems are sometimes fitted with a Schrader-type <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> fitting, and any trapped, now-compressed air can be bled from the valve by manually depressing the valve stem until water rather than air begins to emerge.|$|R

The approach in the determination of the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> was to measure their response to flow acceleration/ decelerations, which are imposed upon the valve. In this way, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> behaviour following events like system start-up, pump trip and pipe rupture is simulated.

The research undertaken in this thesis examined previous investigations into these matters {{and the consequences of}} using <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on flight safety and crew and passenger health. This research examined: (a) health issues reported by aircrew as a consequence of exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> whilst flying by way of several descriptive surveys; (b) various aviation air monitoring studies previously undertaken were reviewed to assess the knowledge base of the chemicals present during contaminated air events; (c) air sampling data were evaluated for their usefulness in determining any potential adverse health effects; (d) a review was undertaken of the frequency of contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> events; (e) a review was undertaken of some of the information known by the aviation industry and others about contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> Analysis of the evidence that <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> contaminated by synthetic jet engine oils and hydraulic fluids, is a regular and normal occurrence and far more common than previously accepted and is a consequence of the current <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system design.

The thesis argues that the precautionary principle, occupational health and safety guidelines and aviation regulations are being ignored by the aviation industry, who continue to claim that cabin air is safe. The systemic misuse of available data is widespread, secondary to commercial objectives, and places passenger and crew health and flight safety at serious risk. The thesis concludes that the use of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on commercial aircraft with no form of contaminated air detection or filtration system present should be discontinued.
