5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have <b>brushed</b> <b>it</b> off with a humorous comment.|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just <b>brushed</b> <b>it</b> off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E
500|$|Although {{no music}} video was officially {{confirmed}} or produced, media outlets {{reported that a}} music video for [...] "Superstar" [...] was to be shot in October 2012. Madonna wanted to dress as a [...] "Terror Bride", which {{is a combination of}} an Iraqi bridal veil and a US soldier's uniform. The dress was to be portrayed as a statement for oppression against women and warfare. However, the singer's advisers talked her out of wearing the costume because they thought it would [...] "put her life at risk". Sources then stated [...] " [...] had the outfit ready to go. She was really proud of it and said it was her 'Terror Bride' costume [...] At first, when people started telling her it was madness, she just <b>brushed</b> <b>it</b> off, but when they mentioned that her actions could put her life at risk, she decided to ditch it from her video and certainly won't be wearing it on stage." [...] Madonna said she was [...] "really disappointed" [...] about not wearing the outfit, but had put aside the idea for a future use.|$|E

500|$|A later {{analysis}} by the Toronto Star in 2011 suggested that the [...] "macho" [...] attitude of the NHL in that era, {{as well as his}} aggressive playing style, {{played a significant role in}} Masterton's death. [...] Coach Wren Blair believed that Masterton was playing despite a pre-existing brain hemorrhage, and was concerned enough that he wanted to have Masterton checked out by a doctor. [...] However, Masterton <b>brushed</b> <b>it</b> off. [...] Longtime NHL coach John Muckler, who was then the coach of the Stars' second-tier farm team, the Memphis South Stars, believed that Masterton may have suffered a brain injury as early as training camp. [...] During the season, several players and coaches recalled seeing Masterton black out during rushes in practice. [...] Goaltender Cesare Maniago recalled that the night before the fatal hit, Masterton had been complaining of severe migraines that he'd had for over a week. [...] They felt it caused what was otherwise viewed as a routine, albeit hard, bodycheck to turn fatal. [...] Toronto neurosurgeon and concussion expert Charles Tator reviewed Masterton's autopsy and opined that Masterton had suffered second-impact syndrome, which occurs when a person suffers a second concussion on top of an earlier, untreated concussion. [...] When this happens, it can cause rapid and often fatal brain swelling.|$|E
