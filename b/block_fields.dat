5000|$|All of the {{observed}} ringing rock boulder fields in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey are a form of felsenmeer. Felsenmeer is a German term meaning [...] "sea of rock". These barren <b>block</b> <b>fields</b> occur in periglacial environments where outcrops of resistant rock are exposed with a slope of less than 25°. Frost wedging breaks up the upper portion of the rock formation, and the slight dip of the field allows the fine weathering materials to be flushed away before soil can develop. Often the boulders are lifted and rotated by the accumulation of snow and ice, leaving {{a considerable amount of}} vacant space between them. The felsenmeer boulder fields form in-situ due to the low slope angles. In situations where the slope angles are steeper than 25°.gravity tends to move the boulders downhill to form scree or talus slopes. In fields where the angle is too flat the spaces between the boulders fills with soil and the boulders break down due to weathering.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{and image}} {{spectroscopy}} for mapping of selected rocks in peak {{areas of the}} Krkonoše Mountains Abstract This thesis deals with geological mapping of selected rocks in peak areas of the Krkonoše Mountains. Four areas of interest were situated in two parts of Krkonše Mountains - {{on the west side}} it is the area of Vysoké kolo and Harrachovy kameny and on the east side there is the area of Sněžka and the area of Kozí hřbety. The main data were acquired by the hyperspectral sensor APEX. Ground spectral measurments of selected rocks and <b>block</b> <b>fields</b> were executed and the laboratory spectral measurments of geological samples and lichens were executed. Practical part aims at classification of rocks and lichens in selected areas using four classification methods: SAM, SID, MESMA and LSU. The spectral library is one of the outputs of this thesis. This spectral library contains the spectra of pure rocks and lichens and mixtured spectra of rocks and lichens. The output of this thesis is the comparation of used classification methods, the analysis of spatial and geological accuracy and evaluation of lichens influence on the classification results, spectral library and maps of classified rocks occurrence.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a factorization of the fermion determinant in lattice QCD with Wilson-type fermions {{that leads to}} a bosonic action local in the <b>block</b> <b>fields.</b> The interaction among gauge fields on distant blocks is mediated by multiboson fields located on the boundaries of the blocks. The resultant multiboson domain-decomposed hybrid Monte Carlo passes extensive numerical tests carried out by measuring standard gluonic observables. The combination of the determinant factorization and of the one of the propagator, that we put forward recently, paves the way for multilevel Monte Carlo integration in presence of fermions. We test this possibility by computing the disconnected correlator of two flavor-diagonal pseudoscalar densities, and we observe a significant increase of the signal-to-noise ratio due to a two-level integration...|$|E

40|$|North-eastern part of Frýdlantský Spur is {{situated}} at the northern foothills of the Jizera Mountains. It represents an area, which was at least twice covered by North-European ice sheet during the Middle Pleistocene. At the same time, it is the region whose hills have the summits around the expected altitudinal limit of the maximum ice sheet extent. Therefore, it is a suitable area to study glacial trimline altitude. Schmidt hammer testing was applied to determine different state of rock surface weathering. Obtained R-values were taken as the most relevant data for glacial trimline determination. Nevertheless, other approaches (GIS analysis, outcrops, <b>block</b> <b>fields</b> and erratics mapping) were also incorporated. Interpretation of these approaches gave the altitudinal limit of ice sheets in the north-eastern part of the Frýdlantský Spur at 500 m a. s. l. ± 20 m...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new 1 : 10 000 scale geomorphological map of Cadair Idris, Wales. The geomorphology was mapped by {{the interpretation of}} colour aerial photographs (scale 1 : 10 000) and field investigations of landform/sediment associations. Digital Elevation Models (horizontal resolution 5 m, vertical resolution 1 m) sourced from NEXTMap Britain were used to supplement the geomorphological mapping, significantly enhancing the ability to observe and identify landforms, bedrock structure and landscape composition. The geomorphological map shows the spatial distribution of glacial, periglacial and postglacial landforms such as cirques, end moraines, glacial striations, <b>block</b> <b>fields,</b> tors, meltwater channels, scree slopes and alluvial fans. Some of these features have not previously been identified, such as recessional moraines. The mapped landforms are used to make inferences about the glacial history of the area and will thereby give insight into the palaeoglaciology of the central Welsh uplands. The geomorphological mapping will {{also be used as}} basis for geoconservation planning by th...|$|E
40|$|Only limited {{parts of}} Tasmania were glaciated {{during the late}} Pleistocene. The extra-glacial regions exhibit many landforms and {{deposits}} that were developed at least partly by periglacial processes. Block streams, <b>block</b> <b>fields</b> and screes are well developed above 900 m on the dolerite plateaux {{of central and eastern}} Tasmania, while slope deposits of angular clasts occur on the siliceous rocks of western mountain areas. Extensive fossil solifluction deposits extend down to c. 500 m in central Tasmania, whereas modern frost-creep terraces and solifluction lobes occur only locally above 900 m in poorly vegetated areas. Active sorted polygonsmay occur on bare areas down to 600 m, and contemporary snowpatch erosion occurs above 1000 m. Fossil ice-pushed shoreline features occur on some lakes on the dolerite Central Plateau, while stabilized terrestrial sand dunes occur at lower altitudes in theMidlands and east. Few of these landforms and deposits are yet well dated, and many may have been formed during several cold stages of the Pleistocene. There is little evidence for Pleistocene permafrost below 1000 - 1200 m on the island...|$|E

40|$|Thie thesis {{consists}} of three main parts: an introduction, a description of physical conditions in the studied area and a main part which includes results of geomorphologic research and mapping. The area of interest is situated in central Bohemia in preserved area called Blanik. In the region there are two structural hills where the research was done. The names of these hills are Velký and Malý Blaník. Geologic structure of the region is built of Proterozoic - Paleozoic metamorphic rocks of Moldanubicum. Moldanubicum is represented here by muscovite - biotite orthogneiss (called blanicka) and muscovite - biotite paragneiss. Both hills are created by muscovite - biotite orthogneiss so all the landforms are of its origin. There were classified structural, cryogenic, fluvial and other landforms in this thesis. Special {{attention was paid to}} cryogenic forms: frost - riven cliffs, cryoplanation plateaux, pseudocirques, <b>block</b> <b>fields</b> and many others. Almost 1000 measurements of joints were done. Cloose` s rosettes show systems of joints which prove tectonic system in the region and determine different mezoforms. Mapping brought some more results. Fluvial erosional and accumulative forms were classified as well as the anthropogenous forms. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|Serra da Estrela is an {{elevated}} granite massif in central Portugal, characterized by extensive plateau surfaces incised by deep valleys affected by Quaternary glaciation, bounded by steep fault-generated escarpments. The presence of seven major textural variants of granite {{provides an opportunity}} to study the relationships between lithology and relief, whereas DEM analysis helped to show the relationships between lithology and topography objectively. The higher ground is associated with fine- tomedium-grained granites and is typified by planar surfaces of low gradient, with occasional angular tors and rock pedestals. <b>Block</b> <b>fields</b> built by angular material are common in the parts that were not previously glaciated. Less elevated parts of the plateau are supported by medium- to coarse-grained granites and show more varied topography, {{with an abundance of}} tors, Boulder piles, and depressions. Lithological boundaries locally coincide with slope breaks {{but this is not the}} rule. In the northern part of the massif a deep topographic basin has evolved in biotite granite, whereas deeply incised valleys follow major fault lines. Geological controls show a hierarchy, in that gross relief reflects the pattern of tectonic uplift and subsidence, whereas lithology and then fracture patterns become more and more important if one focuses on smaller and smaller landforms. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The Mini-RF radar {{instrument}} on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft mapped both lunar {{poles in}} two different RF wavelengths (complete mapping at 12. 6 cm S-band and partial mapping at 4. 2 cm X-band) in two look directions, removing much of the ambiguity of previous Earth- and spacecraft-based radar mapping of the Moon's polar regions. The poles are typical highland terrain, showing expected values of radar cross section (albedo) and circular polarization ratio (CPR). Most fresh craters display high values of CPR in and outside the crater rim; the pattern of these CPR distributions is consistent {{with high levels of}} wavelength-scale surface roughness associated with the presence of <b>block</b> <b>fields,</b> impact melt flows, and fallback breccia. A different class of polar crater exhibits high CPR only in their interiors, interiors that are both permanently dark and very cold (less than 100 K). Application of scattering models developed previously suggests that these anomalously high-CPR deposits exhibit behavior consistent with the presence of water ice. If this interpretation is correct, then both poles may contain several hundred million tons of water in the form of relatively "clean" ice, all within the upper couple of meters of the lunar surface. The existence of significant water ice deposits enables both long-term human habitation of the Moon {{and the creation of a}} permanent cislunar space transportation system based upon the harvest and use of lunar propellant...|$|E
