It was inspired by [...] "visual psychedelia" [...] of the hippie culture of the 1960s, but additionally uses some elements of futurism and symbolism. Another characteristic feature of the book is Saudek's processing of the sequences of pictures, similar to film editing. The formatting of individual pages is unusual, given the time of the creation of the book. It makes use <b>of</b> <b>bevelled</b> <b>frames,</b> enabling innovative work with the space and perspective.|$|R

The modern version is {{generally}} hafted inline, the blade and handle typically having the same long axis. If the <b>bevel</b> <b>of</b> the blade is on the outer surface of the curve the gouge is called an 'outcannel' gouge, otherwise it is known as an 'incannel' gouge. Gouges with angled rather than curved blades are often called 'V-gouges' or 'vee-parting tools'.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Shaping Burrs are {{produced}} {{at the edge}} of a workpiece when a cutter exits it. It causes difficulties in manufacturing and assembly stages. Several attempts were made to minimize burr to suppress deburring to improve productivity. Deburring of the surface in shaping operation in railways industry and other industries is a great problem. An investigation on burr formation at the exit edge of aluminum alloy (4600 -M) flats in shaping operation is done in this work under dry environment. It is found out that burr is negligible at 15 0 exit edge <b>bevel</b> angle. Distribution <b>of</b> shear stress is analyzed using FEM to validate the experimental results. It is found that maximum equivalent stress and deformation at different points on the 15 0 exit edge bevel angle become minimum justifying the experimental observation. Hence, an exit edge <b>bevel</b> <b>of</b> 15 0 may be adopted to have minimum burr formation...|$|R
