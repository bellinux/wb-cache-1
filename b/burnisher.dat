Dr. Gregg, through the prestige of his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent professional tales, was conceded the hammock that was swung between the door jamb and a calabash-tree. Keogh had moved out upon the grass a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed photographs. He was the only busy one of the group.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Neolithic and Chalcolithic stone tools {{found at the}} Măgura ‘Buduiasca’ and Vităneşti ‘Măgurice’ sites in {{southern}} Romania, which might {{been involved in the}} chaîne opératoire of ceramic pottery production. To better understand how ceramic objects were made during this period, {{it is important to know}} what tools were available. Representative artefacts were selected from the sites and have here been grouped based on their possible involvement in various stages of pottery production: a) quarrying of the raw claystone (picks); b) processing the raw materials (mortars and pestles); and c) surface finishing (smoothers, <b>burnishers,</b> polishers). The surface of the tools was examined by non-destructive methods (handheld loupe, stereomicroscope) with the aim of further determining their function and whether they were likely used in the ceramics industry. This study provides examples of specific Neolithic and Chalcolithic stone tool types and illustrates characteristics useful for identifying their use. It also shows the possible chaîne opératoire of pottery produced during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic in the area of southern Romania. It is considered that most of these tools categories, and likely most of the individual tools themselves, had multiple uses, or similar uses with different materials in different industries. It is therefore difficult to determine with much certainty whether they were only used within the ceramics industry...|$|R
2500|$|Gravers come in {{a variety}} of shapes and sizes that yield {{different}} line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as [...] "wriggle" [...] cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and <b>burnishers</b> are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.|$|R
6000|$|... 45. But I cannot {{pass without}} some brief notice our habit--continually, {{as it seems}} to me, gaining strength--of putting a large {{quantity}} of thought and work, annually, into things which are either in their nature necessarily perishable, as dress; or else into compliances with the fashion of the day, in things not necessarily perishable, as plate. I am afraid almost the first idea of a young rich couple setting up house in London, is, that they must have new plate. Their father's plate may be very handsome, but the fashion is changed. They will have a new service from the leading manufacturer, and the old plate, except a few apostle spoons, and a cup which Charles the Second drank a health in to their pretty ancestress, is sent to be melted down, and made up with new flourishes and fresh lustre. Now, so long as this is the case--so long, observe, as fashion has influence on the manufacture of plate--so long you cannot have a goldsmith's art in this country. Do you suppose any workman worthy the name will put his brains into a cup, or an urn, which he knows is to go to the melting-pot in half a score years? He will not; you don't ask or expect it of him. You ask of him nothing but a little quick handicraft--a clever twist of a handle here, and a foot there, a convolvulus from the newest school of design, a pheasant from Landseer's game cards; a couple of sentimental figures for supporters, {{in the style of the}} signs of insurance offices, then a clever touch with the <b>burnisher,</b> and there's your epergne, the admiration of all the footmen at the wedding-breakfast, and the torment of some unfortunate youth who cannot see the pretty girl opposite to him, through its tyrannous branches.|$|E
60|$|In regard of the potter, popularly {{so called}} (says the plate), you don't {{mean to say}} you have {{forgotten}} that a workman called a Thrower is the man under whose hand this grey dough takes {{the shapes of the}} simpler household vessels as quickly as the eye can follow? You don't mean to say you cannot call him up before you, sitting, with his attendant woman, at his potter's wheel - a disc {{about the size of a}} dinner-plate, revolving on two drums slowly or quickly as he wills - who made you a complete breakfast-set for a bachelor, as a good-humoured little off-hand joke? You remember how he took up as much dough as he wanted, and, throwing it on his wheel, in a moment fashioned it into a teacup - caught up more clay and made a saucer - a larger dab and whirled it into a teapot - winked at a smaller dab and converted it into the lid of the teapot, accurately fitting by the measurement of his eye alone - coaxed a middle-sized dab for two seconds, broke it, turned it over at the rim, and made a milkpot - laughed, and turned out a slop- basin - coughed, and provided for the sugar? Neither, I think, are you oblivious of the newer mode of making various articles, but especially basins, according to which improvement a mould revolves instead of a disc? For you MUST remember (says the plate) how you saw the mould of a little basin spinning round and round, and how the workmen smoothed and pressed a handful of dough upon it, and how with an instrument called a profile (a piece of wood, representing the profile of a basin's foot) he cleverly scraped and carved the ring which makes the base of any such basin, and then took the basin off the lathe like a doughy skull-cap to be dried, and afterwards (in what is called a green state) to be put into a second lathe, there to be finished and burnished with a steel <b>burnisher?</b> And as to moulding in general (says the plate), it can't be necessary for me to remind you that all ornamental articles, and indeed all articles not quite circular, are made in moulds. For you must remember how you saw the vegetable dishes, for example, being made in moulds; and how the handles of teacups, and the spouts of teapots, and the feet of tureens, and so forth, are all made in little separate moulds, and are each stuck on to the body corporate, of which it is destined to form a part, with a stuff called 'slag,' as quickly as you can recollect it. Further, you learnt - you know you did - in the same visit, how the beautiful sculptures in the delicate new material called Parian, are all constructed in moulds; how, into that material, animal bones are ground up, because the phosphate of lime contained in bones makes it translucent; how everything is moulded, before going into the fire, one-fourth larger than it is intended to come out of the fire, because it shrinks in that proportion in the intense heat; how, when a figure shrinks unequally, it is spoiled - emerging from the furnace a misshapen birth; a big head and a little body, or a little head and a big body, or a Quasimodo with long arms and short legs, or a Miss Biffin with neither legs nor arms worth mentioning.|$|E

40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of thread mills, instead of taps, roll <b>burnishers,</b> dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of thread mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of thread mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of thread mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of thread mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of thread mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of thread mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of thread mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter of the cut thread. The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated. The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool. Approximation of the specified parameters is carried out and mathematical dependences, which can be further used to calculate and choose the starting values of design data in designing the abovementioned constructions of thread mills. </p...|$|R

5000|$|When {{a copper}} plate is {{roughened}} {{in preparation for}} working on it, thousands of tiny holes are produced {{on the surface of}} the plate to hold the ink. Kipniss's preference has been for mechanically roughened plates because of their greater uniformity. Unlike many makers of mezzotints, he prefers using a <b>burnisher</b> rather than a scraper for reducing the depth of the holes, a process that controls the amount of ink held on the plate. The <b>burnisher</b> allows him freer motion and a greater range of pressure, as a pencil would, giving him the ability to create an image that looks drawn rather than machine crafted. Over time, Kipniss sought [...] "narrower ranges of middle tones" [...] while still bringing out the richness and resonance of darks characteristic of mezzotints.

50|$|The only hotel {{actually}} {{located on}} Union Square is the Westin St. Francis hotel which is celebrated for its historic Magneta Grandfather Clock. It {{is believed to}} be the only hotel in the world that offers its guests, as a courtesy, a coin washing service. The process originated in 1938 at a time when high-society ladies wore white gloves that were easily tarnished during the exchange of money. It uses borax soap in an antiquated, manually-operated <b>burnisher.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{create the}} {{distinct}} round contours of this sculpture, the sculptor primarily worked with an adze, {{which has a}} wooden handle to which a metal blade is attached at an acute angle. Knives and a <b>burnisher</b> were also used. Kuba carvers demonstrated fine hand and eye coordination to bring out details with {{the combination of these}} tools. In addition to the naturalistic shape of the facial features and body parts, the sculptor reproduces realistic detail on the body, including the collarbones and outline of the lips.|$|E

Nobody has ever gone into this castle, the listener is told, and managed to escape with his life, unless he brings a craft. Kai {{says that he is}} a sword <b>burnisher</b> and is allowed admittance. Having burnished the giant’s sword to its owner’s satisfaction, Kai contrives to hold it above the giant’s head whilst pretending to inspect its sheath, cuts off Wrnach’s head and so achieves the task.|$|E
