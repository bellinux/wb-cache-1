5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of camouflage, the {{intention}} of dazzle is not to conceal <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it difficult to estimate a target's range, speed, and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that he had intended dazzle primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship's course and so {{to take up a}} poor firing position.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at {{a meeting at the}} Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

5|$|In Tokyo, after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi's {{plans to}} kill {{everyone}} connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the ougi of the Kamiya Kasshin. Enishi {{says that his}} {{goal is not to}} kill Kenshin, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him suffer by killing the person most important to him: Kaoru. He kidnaps her, leaving a replica of her dead body. Convinced that he again failed to save the one who was most important to him, Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression. When he learns that Kaoru is alive, he and the group rescue her from Enishi. They marry and have a son, Himura Kenji.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large mailbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the whole area around them had broken up. After a desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small glacier tongue. They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to it had gone, leaving a stretch of open water. They had little choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E
5|$|Sardou's five-act play La Tosca {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the characters' motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not really want to complete the project.|$|E

5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the North Vietnamese pay {{too heavy}} a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{built an}} eight-foot foam {{model of the}} Zeppelin to {{complement}} shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan {{was used for the}} shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences.|$|E

25|$|A rocket design can be {{as simple}} as a {{cardboard}} tube filled with black powder, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an efficient, accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems.

25|$|The Oyo Empire, {{like many}} empires before it, used {{both local and}} {{tributary}} forces to expand its domains. The structure of the Oyo military prior to its imperial period was simple and closer aligned to the central government in metropolitan Oyo.

25|$|In 1901, the Society of Arts {{scheme was}} taken over by the London County Council (LCC), which gave much thought to the future design of the plaques. It was {{eventually}} decided to keep the basic shape and design of the Society's plaques, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them uniformly blue, with a laurel wreath and the LCC's title. Though this design was used consistently from 1903 to 1938, some experimentation occurred in the 1920s, and plaques were made in bronze, stone and lead. Shape and colour also varied.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the reform program was not to abandon {{communism}} <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work better by substantially increasing the role of market mechanisms {{in the system and}} by reducing—not eliminating—government planning and direct control. The process of reform was incremental. New measures were first introduced experimentally in a few localities and then were popularized and disseminated nationally if they proved successful. By 1987 the program had achieved remarkable results in increasing supplies of food and other consumer goods and had created a new climate of dynamism and opportunity in the economy. At the same time, however, the reforms also had created new problems and tensions, leading to intense questioning and political struggles over the program's future.|$|E
25|$|Anguissola's {{education}} and training had different implications than that of men, since men and women worked in separate spheres. Her training was not to help her into a profession wherein she would compete for commissions with male artists, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her a better wife, companion, and mother. Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her to transcend the constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or history paintings.|$|E
25|$|After Wilhelm von Starkenberg's {{capitulation}} on 26 November 1426, Oswald was {{the last}} nobleman feuding with Count Friedrich, and was summoned to the Landtag in Bolzano. Oswald again fled Tyrol, but his flight was discovered. He was apprehended near Wasserburg on Lake Constance, brought back to Tyrol, and imprisoned in Castle Vellenberg (later Castle Sonnenburg) in Innsbruck. Oswald now had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace with Count Friedrich, who forced him to pay Martin Jäger a compensation {{in exchange for the}} stolen tithes, and in the process allowed Oswald to acquire full ownership of Castle Hauenstein and its estates. Furthermore, Oswald had to swear to refrain from any contact with nobles from outside Tyrol unless sanctioned by Count Friedrich.|$|E
