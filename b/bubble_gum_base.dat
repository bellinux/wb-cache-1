50|$|Gum {{bases for}} chewing gum are {{different}} from those for bubble gum. A <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> is formulated with the ability to blow bubbles; it contains higher levels of elastomers or higher molecular weight polymers for this purpose. Gum bases for non-acid flavored gum use calcium carbonate as a filler, while gum bases for acid flavored gum use talc as a filler, since acids can react with calcium carbonate to produce Carbon Dioxide gas, which is undesirable.|$|E
50|$|Franklin V. Canning {{became a}} partner with Bowman in 1930. Canning, a New York {{druggist}} who supplied the pink <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> material to Gum, Inc., supplied working capital in return for 50 percent (250 shares) of the company stock. A subsidiary of The William Wrigley Jr. Company developed a better gum base in 1932, which sold for less than Canning's base. President Bowman demanded that Canning reduce {{the price of the}} gum base, which resulted in altercations between the two and ended in Bowman being ousted from the company in 1936. In July 1937, Bowman returned to the company after a long, bitter legal battle which ended in the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court upholding his reinstatement as president of the company. Gum, Inc. had earnings of $49,000 on sales estimated at about $800,000 {{in the first six months}} of 1937. In September 1937, Bowman's estranged second wife, Ruth, filed a suit against Bowman for part ownership of Gum, Inc., claiming a verbal agreement to a half-interest in his holdings.|$|E

It would be another 20 years until Diemer would use the original idea as inspiration for his invention.|$|R

5000|$|Hubba Bubba is a {{brand of}} <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> {{originally}} produced by Wm.

[...] The main gimmick used to promote the gum is that Hubba Bubba is less sticky than other brands of <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> and so burst bubbles are easier to peel from your skin. The first portions of Hubba Bubba were produced in the traditional <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> flavor often referred to as Original, but different flavors of gum have been produced around the world. Many, but not all, of these flavors are based on fruit. Hubba Bubba products also include many flavors of soda, <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> and squeeze pouches.|$|R
