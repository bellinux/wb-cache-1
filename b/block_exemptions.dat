50|$|Exemptions to Article 101 {{behaviour}} {{fall into}} three categories. Firstly, Article 101(3) creates an exemption for practices beneficial to consumers, e.g., by facilitating technological advances, but without restricting all {{competition in the}} area. In practice the Commission gave very few official exemptions and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those fixing sale prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market. In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve. Thirdly, the Commission has also introduced a collection of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> for different contract types.

40|$|PROTECTION OF COMPETITION - <b>BLOCK</b> <b>EXEMPTIONS</b> The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{describe}} and analyze regulation of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> mainly {{in the light of}} Commission's Guidelines. The function of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> is to exempt certain agreements from the prohibition of distortion of competition. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects related to the concept of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions.</b> First chapter is an introduction into the topic of protection of competition and explains basic principles and terminology. Chapter two deals with other exemptions from prohibition of distorting competition. The chapter is divided into four subchapters. The first one analyzes four aspects of the exemption under Article 101 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The second subchapter focuses on de minimis rule. Third subchapter deals with exemption in agriculture sector. Finally, the problem of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> is briefly introduced. Third chapter follows the historic development of the concept of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> both in European law and Czech law. Firstly, it describes the reasons for introduction of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> by the Commission and then it focuses on the change of approach in year 2004, when ex post control was introduced.

40|$|PROTECTION OF COMPETITION - <b>BLOCK</b> <b>EXEMPTIONS</b> The {{main purpose}} of my thesis is to {{describe}} and analyze one aspect of a block exemption regulation for vertical agreements, namely resale price maintenance. The thesis is composed of six parts, one of them dealing with <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> {{in general and the}} rest of them focusing on resale price maintenance. Chapter one introduces the topic of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> and explains the features of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> that are common to all of them. Chapter two presents the definition of resale price maintenance and describes the difference between fixed, minimum, maximum and recommended prices. Chapter three describes economic theories, which have influence on legal treatment of resale price maintenance. The chapter is divided into three subchapters, whereas the first one explicates pro-competitive effects of resale price maintenance, the second one focuses on its anticompetitive effects and the third one summarizes the economic theories of impact of resale price maintenance. Chapter four examines the legal framework of resale price maintenance in European law. Firstly, it describes the treatment of fixed, minimum, recommended and maximum prices. Then it analyzes resale price maintenance as an object restriction and examines possible exemption under Article 101 (1) of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>Exemptions</b> {{represent}} {{means of}} exemption from {{the prohibition of}} restrictive agreements set by the Article 101 (1) TFEU. The main aim of my thesis is to analyze and describe {{the development of an}} approach to <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> and to present how the <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> work in practice. Generally, <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> are issued in the form of Block Exemption Regulations according to Article 101 (3) TFEU. The wording of this provision specifies the conditions under which certain types of agreements may be exempted from the prohibition set by Article 101 (1) TFEU. Regulations are issued by the Council or by the Commission, which is more often. If an agreement accomplishes the criteria laid down in a block exemption regulation, {{there is no need to}} notify that agreement individually because the agreement is automatically valid and effective. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The first two chapters are introductory. Chapter One refers to the protection of competition in general. Subsequently, Chapter Two deals with main exemptions from the prohibition of restrictive agreements, such as agreements exempted from the prohibition under Article 101 (3) TFEU or the de minimis rule of exemption from the prohibition. Chapter Three, which is subdivided into three parts, explains the development of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the application of}} Community principles of freedom to provide services and of free competition in international shipping lines in relation to unilateral and bilateral measures implemented by various countries to defend the interests of their flag shipping companies and in relation to agreements between shipowners (conferences, shipping consortia, strategic alliances) {{in order to reduce}} competition. With regard to the latter aspect is taken into account the question of the compatibility between agreements in liner shipping and EU antitrust rules (article 101 and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) with particular attention to liner conferences. In 1986 a <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> from the application of the European antitrust law had been justified on the assumption that liner conferences brought stability, ensuring shippers reliable services that could not be achieved by less restrictive means. The <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> had been in place for two decades. More recently a study conducted by the European Commission determined that liner conferences operating in EU trades were not producing the anticipated benefits that had justified the original <b>block</b> <b>exemption.</b> So, in 2006 the European Union decided to repeal the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> from competition law for liner shipping conferences. After a two years transition period, the repeal went into effect in October 2008. It is therefore examined the impact of the repeal of the conference <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> on the shipowners, on the shippers and in general on the international liner trades. The importance and actuality of the subject taken into account in this book are, inter alia, confirmed {{by the fact that the}} Federal Maritime Commission, in a recent study, published in 2012, compares US and EU liner trades in order to identify the effects of the UE repeal of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Master's thesis {{provides}} {{readers with}} a basic analysis of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010. The mentioned regulation confers a benefit of the so called <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> on broad spectrum of vertical agreements including in this context also certain agreements among competing undertakings. Since agreements enjoying {{the benefit of the}} <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> are presumed to meet criteria stipulated in Article 101 (3) TFEU, the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> eliminates legal uncertainty which undertakings whose agreements distort competition within the meaning of Article 101 (1) TFEU would otherwise face. It follows that {{it is not necessary to}} examine such agreements on its merits. Thus, transaction costs are reduced. Structure of the thesis is chosen so that it reflects three main questions concerning applicability of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption,</b> namely whether (i) an agreement falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010, whether (ii) it contains black clauses (hard-core restrictions) and whether (iii) it contains (non-severable) grey clauses. After a brief description of wider connections and general issues in Chapter One, in Chapter Two the thesis deals with the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010 with respect to the notion of vertical agreement, the role of intellectual property rights, the treatment of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> in the {{automobile}} industry. It analyses their position within EU competition law. The {{aim of the}} thesis is {{to answer the question}} whether the sector-specific <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> regulating the automobile industry comply with general aims of EU competition law and to analyse their relationship with EU competition law as lex generalis and lex specialis. In order to achieve these goals, the thesis is divided into 5 chapters. The first chapter deals with <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> in general. It describes the reason why <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> have been invented and their subsequent development. In the first chapter there is also an explanation of their structure and method of legal regulation. This chapter then describes development of the general block exemption for vertical agreements and of the block exemption in the automobile industry. Description of their development is based on the decision in BMW case because rules set in this decision were the basis of the first block exemption in automobile industry. Second chapter deals with the newest block exemption in automobile industry - regulation No. 461 / 2010. With the newest block exemption the era of sector specific rules for the sale of new vehicles has ended. Regulation No. 461 / 2010 creates specific rules only for the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my thesis was to {{describe}} and analyse {{the system of the}} <b>block</b> <b>exemptions.</b> Briefly, the block exemption is a kind of exemption from the prohibition under article 101 (1) TFEU because it is supposed to fulfil the criteria of article 101 (3) TFEU. It exempts certain category of agreements, which are covered by the special regulation issued by the Council or more often by the Commission. The paper is divided into seven chapters and the first opening chapters are dealing with more general aspects of block exemption: the function, process of issuing, non- application and the advent of block exemption where the regulation 1 / 2003 (Modernisation Regulation) should be of special attention. It abolished the regime of previous notification of agreements to the Commission. An introduction to the system of other exemptions from the prohibition under article 101 (1) TFEU is also described there. The following part (chapter 4) focuses more detailed on the kinds of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions,</b> which are divided into the vertical, horizontal and sector exemptions. The former exemptions issued by the Czech Office for the Protection of Competition are no longer applicable and therefore only the <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> of the EU are of the concern of this paper. Furthermore, the special competition regime of some [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation is an {{exemption}} {{in a business}} line or industry, which debars organizations in the industry from some business activities {{in order to create}} competition. The regulation is highly known in the automobile industry due to the effect caused by the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation (BER) from the European Commission. BER has changed the automobile industry in the last decade. Prior to 2003 automobile owners in the EU region risk nullifying their vehicle warranty when the vehicles were serviced or repaired in workshops not belonging to the vehicle manufacturer or its dealers. This barrier was broken in October 2003, when the European Commission (EC) passed a law allowing vehicle owners the freedom of having their servicing and repairs done at their chosen workshop.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{consequences}} of the new laws regulating vertical relations in automotive retailing. The automotive industry has its own set of competition laws regulating vertical relations, called the Motor Vehicle <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption.</b> The name meaning that the distribution of motor vehicles is exempted as a block from the general European competition policy. The regulation covers the European Economic Area, i. e. The European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The automotive industry is a large and important industry in Europe. The top manufacturers are some of the largest firms in the world and of high importance to the domestic industries. Certain aspects have for a long time characterized the distribution of cars in Norway and more generally Europe. The up-stream market is more concentrated and relative stronger than the down-stream market. A large majority of the dealers is independent retailers, i. e. not owned by the manufacturers. The brand aspects of the industry are strong; there are distinct differentiated brands with names, logos and attributes well known to most consumers. Cars {{are some of the most}} complex and important consumer products available. Many consumers are dependent on cars and if they malfunction it may have disastrous consequences. Because of the importance of the industry; The European Commission has for a long time recognized that the automotive industry requires its own set of competition rules. The Commission changed the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> in 2002 because they were of the opinion that the old <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> from 1995 was outdated. The 1995 regulation had for example no rules regulating sales on the Internet. The scope for the thesis is hence to first discuss the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> compared to the old, determine the effects and then analyzing them. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> also regulates the supply of spare parts and after sale services, but my focus will entirely be on the distribution of new passenger cars. I will first discuss the main effects in a general context and then build a model to analyze them in a vertical framework. I will try to give some answers to the following questions: ·	Why do we have economic regulation in general and why does motor vehicle distribution have its own regulation? ·	Which vertical restraints were affected by changes made in the regulation with the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption?</b> ·	What are the effects normally associated with these vertical restraints? ·	How are the vertical relations between suppliers and dealers in the automotive industry affected by the regulatory changes? In Chapter 2 I will give a brief characterization of the industry. The focus will be on the main aspects, such as market concentration and demand. I will also see if the Norwegian market has any special attributes compared to the rest of Europe. Chapter 3 consists of three parts. In the first part I discuss theories explaining the existence of competition policy. The motivation for this is that it is also important to have in mind why a set of regulation exists when discussing its consequences. I will discuss vertical relations generally in the second part. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> concerns vertical relations and a general discussion of this felt necessary before discussing the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> in detail. The main part of the chapter will be a detailed discussion of the important changes in the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> compared to the old and which forms of vertical restraints that are affected. I will give a discussion of the two important vertical restraints found in Chapter 3, exclusive dealing and exclusive territories, in Chapter 4. I will discuss the important aspects that are normally associated with these vertical restraints and how different settings affect the effects of them. The main model will be found in Chapter 5. The model consists of two producers selling close substitutes and competing in prices. The idea is to observe how the possibility to use different vertical restraints affects the producers’ incentives to use independent retailers. The model is based on several existing papers analyzing vertical relations. I will show that the possibility to use two-part tariffs is necessary for vertical separation to be a dominant strategy. If franchise-fee is possible then nonexclusive dealing will remove the gain that the producers get from using independent retailers, but will not alone give the producers incentives to integrate vertically. I will also show that nonexclusive dealing only leads to lower prices if the producers may use franchise-fees. The conclusion is found in Chapter 6. Here I will sum up the effects the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> has and give some remarks on possible developments in the Norwegian market...|$|R

40|$|In 1992 the European Commission {{adopted an}} {{exempting}} regulation {{for the insurance}} market that was replaced in 2010 by the so called Insurance <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation (IBER) that will expire on 31 March 2017. The exemption regards the application of competition rules to certain types of agreements in the insurance sector, joint compilations, tables and studies which involve the exchange of information between insurers; and also the common coverage of risk via co-(re) insurance pools. On 17 March, the European Commission released a report focusing {{on the future of}} the Insurance <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation in which it is recommended to not renew IBER. This recommendation comes from the consideration that consumers were not receiving a fair share of the resulting benefits from the cooperation exempted by IBER and that is a Commission’s long-term strategy to eliminate industry-specific exemptions from competition law. This paper aims to investigate, under a law and economics approach, if other factors can be relevant in deciding to not provide any more exemptions for the insurance companies. After an introduction, in the following part, the economics effects of the exchange of information are analysed in terms of asymmetric information remedy and competition restrictions; then the story of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> is presented and the next paragraph deals with the change in the insurance market after the end of the exemption; finally, some conclusive remarks are drawn in the light of the Big Data era...|$|R

There are significant cross-country differences both in the magnitude and the type of instruments used for state aids. The European Commission acts as a de-facto regulator by using competition law to approve state aids. We analyze the rationale of this two step process by pointing out the benefits of decentralizing redistributive decisions to the member states and the costs linked to reduced coordination (the use of structural funds, viewed as a complement to state aids, reduces some of these costs). We then point out that in a second best world objectives of redistribution are not incompatible with competition but that their relationship is less straightforward than with perfect markets; this has consequences for the rationale of having <b>block</b> <b>exemptions,</b> and for the effects of structural funds.

40|$|The {{framework}} {{of this research}} is competition law and IPRs. Competition law regulation concerning <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Articles 101 and 102 mean that companies have to take into consideration certain regulation {{in order to avoid the}} intervention of competition authorities. As the system of TTBER is based on a self-announcement system, companies may take more or less risk in their agreement praxis. The research questions were: What are the preconditions for a competition according to the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) ? This research question can be divided into the following sub-questions: 1) 	How small and medium size companies (SMEs) fulfill the criteria of permitted competition after the changes in <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation concerning the Transfer of Technology? – how SMEs try to achieve market shares 2) 	How small and medium size companies fulfill the criteria of <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> according the new regulation? These questions were scrutinized by litterature reviews, case analysis and updated materials from experts e. g. corporate lawyers and attorneys. The main results of the research were as follows: The doctrine of the misuse of a dominant position has often been a core issue in case law of European Court of Justice (ECJ) and especially the essential facilities problem. It has a chain effect to TTBER regulation. A dominant company can decide how to promote innovations. To identify the market shares it is important to find the relevant markets. The strength and knowledge of the licensee effects to the possibilities to succeed in license negotiations. A powerful company having the resources can take into account the TTBER regulation to favour its goals and take advantage of the economic condition. Often a high royalty is agreed in order to avoid claims. In R&D projects the amount of innovations is relevant in contract negotiations. In some cases companies have agreed of royalties in relation to the amount of the IPRs. SMEs grow into large companies and form joint ventures: it is not easy to evaluate how and when they fulfil the conditions of permitted competition.
