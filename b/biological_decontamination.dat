Radio frequency (rf) atmospheric pressure glow discharges (APGDs) have received growing attention for their exciting scope of new science and their immense potential for widespread applications. While geometrically similar to conventional low-pressure discharges used in the semiconductor industry for decades, rf APGDs present new physics that require investigation. This thesis presents an experimental and computational study of helium rfAPGDs aimed at making {{a contribution to the}} current understanding of these discharges and enabling their optimization for different applications. The timely interest and significance of this work is highlighted by the publication of different parts of this thesis in 10 peer-reviewed international journals. Starting with the electron trapping in rf APGDs, the thesis looks into the electron heating mechanism responsible for sustaining the discharges, the influence of the rf excitation frequency on the discharge characteristics, the role of impurities in the discharge chemistry as well as the evolution of the discharge as the size is reduced down to microplasma dimensions. The findings of this research are based on the synergistic use of electrical measurements, optical diagnostics and self-developed computational models.

For small applied voltages, these effects lead to well known linear electrokinetic phenomena. In this paper, we predict some surprising nonlinear dynamics that can result from the competition between bulk and interfacial transport at higher voltages. When counterions are selectively removed by a membrane or electrode, a “deionization shock” can propagate through the microstructure, leaving in its wake an ultrapure solution, nearly devoid of coions and colloidal impurities. We elucidate the basic physics of deionization shocks and develop a mathematical theory of their existence, structure, and stability, allowing for slow variations in surface charge or channel geometry. Via asymptotic approximations and similarity solutions, we show that deionization shocks accelerate and sharpen in narrowing channels, while they decelerate and weaken, and sometimes disappear, in widening channels.

40|$|This {{project will}} probe {{fundamental}} scientific issues regarding a microbial process with potential for decontaminating corroding metal surfaces. We hypothesize that dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (DIRB), via anaerobic respiration, can quantitatively dissolve amorphous and crystalline iron oxides and thereby release oxide-associated radionuclide contaminants. Associated actinides will be sorbed by cell surfaces or precipitated within biofilms {{that can be}} removed and recovered by enzymatic digestion of microbial attachment factors. This environmentally benign, enzymatic process avoids the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals, minimizes the volume and toxicity of secondary wastes, and could be applied in situ. Although an increasing body of scientific literature supports this working hypothesis, a basic understanding is needed of the biological and chemical processes that impact (1) attachment and detachment of iron reducing bacteria to oxide surfaces; (2) the rate, extent, and products of iron reduction; and (3) the fate of radionuclides following enzymatic reduction of corroding steel (which is needed to evaluate and develop effective <b>biological</b> approaches for <b>decontamination</b> of aging metallic structures and piping). The goal of this project is to provide the scientific underpinnings {{for the development of}} biologically based approaches for the removal of contaminants from corroding steel surfaces. Specifically, this research will accomplish the following: (1) determine the role of oxide structure, topology, and composition on bacterial attachment and subsequent reductive dissolution of Fe(III) oxide corrosion products that form on stainless and mild steels; (2) identify how soluble electron ''shuttles'' can facilitate the rate and extent of microbial reductive dissolution of iron oxide corrosion products, including surface features and pores inaccessible to bacteria; (3) determine the distributions of radionuclides released during reductive dissolution of oxide films on metal surfaces as a function of aqueous geochemical composition. This project uniquely couples PNNL's expertise in microbial metal reduction and biogeochemistry with Montana State University's Center for Biofilm Engineering's expertise and capabilities in biofilm analysis, engineering, and corrosion.

It has been applied in several domains like depollution of industrial effluents, disinfection of water and air, sterilization of various surfaces for food and medical industry and, recently, biomedical applications (wounds disinfection and treatment of diseases). The main interest of NTP is their ability to produce very reactive species (e. g. radicals, excited species, UV [...] .) without heating the bulk of gas: the energy deposited in the plasma is mainly transferred to electrons that will generate reactive species by inelastic collisions with the gas molecules. The gas temperature is typically a few tens of Celsius degrees, so NTP are suitable for decontamination of thermally sensitive materials. Different NTP {{technologies have}} been developed for <b>biological</b> <b>decontamination</b> of surfaces and have shown promising results. Many of them are based on direct exposure of the surface to an electrical discharge: the target must be placed between electrodes and only very thin objects can be treated. Another technique has emerged: atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma jets. The plasma is not confined between electrodes; it expands toward the target, {{so that it can be}} applied to objects with a large volume or a complex shape. In this paper, we present an innovative NTP jet technology based on “plasma bullets” phenomenon: the jet consist of ionization waves that travel through the gas up to the surface. The reactive species are then generated in the vicinity of the microbial target instead of being transported from a remote plasma source. The device developed at ONERA consists of an electrical discharge reactor fed by helium and powered by a high-voltage pulse generator. It allows the propagation of parallel plasma jets over several centimeters in ambient air (see Fig. 1).
