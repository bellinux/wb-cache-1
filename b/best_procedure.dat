50|$|In {{artificial}} intelligence and computer programming, state space planning {{is a process}} used in designing programs to search for data or solutions to problems. In a computer algorithm that searches a data structure {{for a piece of}} data, for example a program that looks up a word in a computer dictionary, the state space is a collective term for all the data to be searched. Similarly, {{artificial intelligence}} programs often employ a process of searching through a finite universe of possible procedures for reaching a goal, to find a procedure or the <b>best</b> <b>procedure</b> to achieve the goal. The universe of possible solutions to be searched is called the state space. State space planning is the process of deciding which parts of the state space the program will search, and in what order.|$|E
5000|$|If White can {{exchange}} all pieces, {{he has a}} big practical {{advantage in}} the endgame due to the better pawn structure. Max Euwe gave the pure pawn ending (without pieces—see diagram) resulting after the exchange of White's d-pawn for Black's e-pawn as a win for White in 1940. The <b>best</b> <b>procedure</b> is detailed in [...] and has been refuted with best play by black to be a draw. In essence, the best plan {{is to create a}} passed pawn on the kingside, while Black is unable to do the same on the queenside because of the doubled pawns. If this is achieved the passed pawn can ties down the Black king and allows White to transfer his King to the queenside at an opportune moment, creating a pawn through to promotion. Modern analysis have shown Black can force a draw with precise defense and preventing the white king entering the 4th rank.|$|E

The shooting remains controversial not only because the killer's motive remains unknown, but also because of purposefully withholding information from the public by the authorities and what is generally perceived as a failed police action.|$|R

50|$|Acute Toxicity Comparison & Inhibition Tests are the <b>best</b> <b>procedures</b> {{for testing}} samples {{with a low}} level of {{toxicity}} when an ECxx can not be determined using the Basic Test. These protocols are recommended for testing waste water treatment plant effluent, stormwater runoff, drinking water, pore water, and eluate.

Similar to the Basic Test, the Comparison Test protocol uses zero time light readings used for correcting the timed light level readings. The Inhibition Test procedure does not use zero time light readings and therefore, can not use a correction factor for the timed light level readings. Both of these tests consists of five controls and five replicates of the sample at a single concentration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{idea that}} at least some aspects of word meaning can be induced from {{patterns}} of word co-occurrence is becoming increasingly popular. However, there is less agreement about the precise computations involved, and the appropriate tests to distinguish between the various possibilities. It is important that the effect of the relevant design choices and parameter values are understood if psychological models using these methods are to be reliably evaluated and compared. In this paper, we present a systematic exploration of the principal computational possibilities for formulating and validating representations of word meanings from word co-occurrence statistics. We find that, once we have identified the <b>best</b> <b>procedures,</b> a very simple approach is surprisingly successful and robust over a range of psychologically relevant evaluation measures...|$|R

40|$|Conversion of Mediterranean maquis and/or {{natural forest}} into agro-pastoral lands {{is a cause}} of soil {{degradation}} in many Mediterranean areas. Indicators of soil physical quality (SPQ) quantitatively linked to soil hydraulic properties are a valuable tool to assess the effect of land use changes. In this investigation, the Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters (<b>BEST)</b> <b>procedure</b> for soil hydraulic characterization was used to estimate SPQ indicators. Four areas of the Baratz Lake watershed, Sardinia, Italy, characterized by both typical natural vegetation (holm oak [Quercus ilex L. ] forest and high maquis) and degraded vegetation (grassland established after fire or clearing of the maquis) were considered. The SPQ was assessed by either independently measured soil physical attributes, like soil bulk density, organic C content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and sorptivity, and “capacitive” and “dynamic” indicators calculated from the water retention curve estimated by the <b>BEST</b> <b>procedure.</b> Measured and estimated SPQ indicators unanimously showed that clearing of the maquis caused a severe deterioration of SPQ associated with soil compaction, organic matter loss, and decrease of macropore volume and soil aeration capacity as well as reduced water circulation. A different and unexpected result was obtained for the fire-affected area, where the SPQ was {{comparable to that of}} the neighboring oak forest area. We deduced that vegetation restoration after fire passage contributed to maintain a high organic matter content and to mitigate rain compaction effects. We concluded that SPQ indicators derived by applying the <b>BEST</b> <b>procedure</b> are suitable to detect land degradation in the natural environments studied...|$|E
