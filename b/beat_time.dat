In late May, his condition worsened, and his five surviving children rushed to join him. Fanny asked if he would enjoy singing some hymns. Although he was unable to sing, his children sang favorite hymns while he <b>beat</b> <b>time</b> with his hands and feet. On May 24, 1879, Garrison lost consciousness and died just before midnight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We aim at {{enabling}} a biped robot {{to interact}} with humans through real-world music in daily-life environments, e. g., to autonomously keep its steps (stamps) in <b>time</b> with musical <b>beats.</b> To achieve this, the robot {{should be able to}} robustly predict the <b>beat</b> <b>times</b> in real time while listening to musical performance with its own ears (head-embedded microphones). However, this has not previously been addressed in most studies on music-synchronized robots due to the difficulty in predicting the <b>beat</b> <b>times</b> in real-world music. To solve this problem, we implemented a beat-tracking method developed in the field of music information processing. The predicted <b>beat</b> <b>times</b> are then used by a feedback-control method that adjusts the robot’s step intervals to synchronize its steps in <b>time</b> with the <b>beats.</b> The experimental results show that the robot can adjust its steps in <b>time</b> with the <b>beat</b> <b>times</b> as the tempo changes. The resulting robot needed about 25 [s] to recognize the tempo change after it and then synchronize its steps. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{developed}} to investigate the potential of coir fibres {{to be used as}} secondary raw material in order to promote environmentally friendly packaging. In addition, old newspapers were embedded in the specimen to hold the coir fibres each other. The main objective was to determine mechanical properties of paper with different <b>beating</b> <b>times</b> and percentages of coir fibres. The responses of this research are tensile index and tear factor. Mechanical pulping process was chosen to produce the pulps in random orientation with cross-machine direction. Regression and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine significant differences between percentages of fibres used and <b>beating</b> <b>time</b> for each response variables. The results show that as <b>beating</b> <b>time</b> increased, the mechanical properties of papers increased. Otherwise, the increment of fibres percentages has caused the mechanical paper properties decreased. The combination of 25 % fibres and 75 % newspaper with 20 min of <b>beating</b> <b>time</b> has produced the best mechanical properties. The conclusion suggests that coir fibres {{can be one of the}} alternative raw materials which can be applied for packaging product...|$|R

In 1964 Williams was {{purchased}} by [...] the Seeburg Corporation. [...] Its 1966 pinball machine A-Go-Go, with its avant-garde 60s theme, sold a record 5,100 units. Early Williams pinball machines often included innovative features and pinball firsts, such as mechanical reel scoring and the [...] "add-a-ball" [...] feature for locations that didn't allow game replays. [...] By 1967, pinball {{was in the middle}} of its so-called [...] "golden age", and the number of pinball units that sold began to increase dramatically.
