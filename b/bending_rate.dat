40|$|The {{absolute}} {{light sensitivity}} of Phycomyces sporangiophores {{was determined by}} analyzing the intensity dependence of the phototropic <b>bending</b> <b>rate</b> and of the light growth and dark growth responses to step changes of the intensity. We found that the different methods give approximately the same results for the wild-type strain, {{as well as for}} several behavioral mutants with defects in the genes madA, madB, and madC. A crucial factor in the determination of thresholds is the light intensity at which the strains grow during the 4 d after inoculation and prior to the experiment. When the wild-type strain grows in the dark, its threshold for the <b>bending</b> <b>rate</b> is 10 (- 9) W X m- 2, compared with 2 X 10 (- 7) W X m- 2 when it is grown under continuous illumination. Further, the maximal <b>bending</b> <b>rate</b> is twice as high in dark-grown strains. This phenomenon is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the diameter and growth rate of the sporangiophores also depend on the illumination conditions prior to the experiment: light-grown sporangiophores have an increased diameter and an increased growth rate compared with dark-grown ones. Some of the behavioral mutants, however, are indifferent to this form of light control. Another factor that is controlled by the growth conditions is adaptation: the kinetics of dark adaptation are slower in light-grown sporangiophores than in dark-grown ones. We found empirically a positive correlation between the slower dark adaptation constant and the threshold of the <b>bending</b> <b>rate,</b> which shows that the two underlying phenomena are functionally related...|$|E

The {{effect of this}} loss on the pulvinus graviresponse was evaluated by following changes in the kinetics of response during the 5 -day dark period. Over 5 days of dark pretreatment, the lag to initial graviresponse and the subsequent half-time to maximum steady state <b>bending</b> <b>rate</b> increased significantly while the maximum <b>bending</b> <b>rate</b> did not change. The change in response to applied indoleacetic acid (100 micromolar) plus gibberellic acid (10 micromolar) without gravistimulation, under identical dark pretreatments, {{was used as a}} model system for the response component of gravitropism. Dark pretreatment did not change the lag to initial response following hormone application to vertical pulvini, but both the maximum <b>bending</b> <b>rate</b> and the half-time to the maximum rate were significantly reduced. Also, after dark pretreatment, significant bending responses following hormone application were observed in vertical segments with or without added sucrose, while gravistimulation produced a response only if segments were given sucrose. These results indicate that starch-filled amyloplasts are required for the graviresponse of barley pulvini and suggest that they function in the stimulus perception and signal transduction components of gravitropism...|$|E

In the manufacturing, the staggered connections using sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D.

The main results are summarized as follows: The pallet weight became small in decreasing the number of sheets of the top board and the difference of the weight was about 6 kgf (20 %). The <b>bend</b> <b>rate</b> in the <b>bending</b> test for each type pallet was smaller than 2. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. The residual <b>bend</b> <b>rate</b> in the <b>bending</b> test for each type pallet was also smaller than 0. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. Therefore, it was confirmed that the condition as the pallet of both the <b>bend</b> <b>rate</b> and the residual <b>bend</b> <b>rate</b> was cleared. In each type pallet, the condition as the pallet in the change rate of the diagonal length in the fall down test was cleared because the change rate of the each value was smaller than 3 % of the standard value of JIS. The remarkable difference of the withdrawal strength of each type pallet in the pull–out test for the staggered connections using sugi compressed dowel was not recognized. Moreover, it became clear that approximately 56 minutes in manufacturing process of one pallet can be shortened and the manufacturing cost can be decreased because four top boards of the backside of the pallet were decreased...|$|R

Polyacrylamide gels with triphenylmethane leucocyanide groups reversibly dilated as much as 18 time by ultraviolet irradiation. Photodissociation of the chromophores generated the osmotic pressure difference between the gel and the outer solution, and the osmotic effect caused the gels to expand.

The nanowires show ultra-high yield strengths, and the achievable large elastic strains directly influence the dislocation nucleation through the change of the unstable stacking fault energy. In agreement with theory and experiments on face-centered cubic 〈 110 〉 nanowires under uniaxial load, the tensile part of the wires exhibit deformation twinning, while plastic deformation in the compressed part takes place by slip of perfect dislocations.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems, Mathematical Modeling, 2006 Plants orient {{themselves}} in a gravitational field through {{a process known as}} gravitropism. In cereal grasses, for example, gravitropic bending raises the seed heads in crops that have been knocked down, thus protecting the seeds from damage. Many details of gravitropism, however, continue to elude the research community despite over 100 years of active research. Because we believe that growth rates hold important clues about gravitropism, we designed a new method for measuring gravitropism in oat (Avena sativa L.) shoot segments. Oat shoot segments, enclosed in CD jewel cases, are placed into vertically-oriented scanners programmed to capture images at regular intervals. We measure the bending angles using custom image processing software and then compute <b>bending</b> <b>rates</b> by differentiating numerically. Using a geometrical model, together with statistical analysis, we show that these <b>bending</b> <b>rates</b> are proportional to growth rates. Finally, by comparing the measured data against mathematical models of the physiology, we show that the gravitropic reaction in pulvini (the graviresponding organs in oats) most likely results from a single pulse of growth factor that is subsequently consumed. If true, then pulvini represent an important exception to the standard feedback model of gravitropism and may therefore be a useful tool for teasing apart the gravitropic process. We believe that our research will provide an important contribution to solving the longstanding puzzle of how plants detect and react to gravity...|$|R

Stable swimming movements, similar to real flagellar movements, can be generated routinely with a 25 -segment model using 16 time steps/beat cycle.

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the mechanism regulating spermatozoa motility, {{it is important}} to investigate the mechanism regulating the conversion of microtubule sliding into flagellar bending. Therefore, we analyzed microtubule sliding and its conversion into flagellar bending using a demembranated spermatozoa model in which microtubule sliding and flagellar bending could be analyzed separately by treating the demembranated spermatozoa with and without dithiothreitol, respectively. Using this model, we examined the roles of cAMP and its target molecules in regulating flagellar bending and microtubule sliding. Although flagellar bending did not occur in the absence of cAMP, microtubule extrusion occurred without it, suggesting that cAMP is necessary for the conversion of microtubule sliding into flagellar bending, but not for microtubule sliding itself. The target of cAMP for regulating flagellar bending was not cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), since flagellar bending was still observed in the spermatozoa treated with a PKA-specific inhibitor. Alternatively, the Epac/Rap pathway may be the target. Epac 2 and Rap 2 were detected in hamster spermatozoa using immunoblotting. Since Rap 2 is a GTPase, we investigated the flagellar bending of demembranated spermatozoa treated with GTPγS. The treatment markedly increased the beat frequency and <b>bending</b> <b>rate.</b> These results suggest that cAMP activates the Epac/Rap pathway to regulate the conversion of microtubule sliding into flagellar bending...|$|E

At these wavelengths, dark adaptation follows a biexponential decay as found previously with broadband blue light (Russo, V. E. A., and P. Galland, 1980, Struct. Bonding., 41 : 71; Lipson, E.

Maximal latencies were found at 383, 477, and 530 nm; minimal latencies were found at 409 and 507 nm.

40|$|Orbiting disks may exhibit bends {{due to a}} {{misalignment}} {{between the}} angular momentum of {{the inner and outer}} regions of the disk. We begin a systematic simulational inquiry into the physics of warped disks with the simplest case: the relaxation of an unforced warp under pure fluid dynamics, i. e. with no internal stresses other than Reynolds stress. We focus on the nonlinear regime in which the <b>bend</b> <b>rate</b> is large compared to the disk aspect ratio. When warps are nonlinear, strong radial pressure gradients drive transonic radial motions along the disk's top and bottom surfaces that efficiently mix angular momentum. The resulting nonlinear decay rate of the warp increases with the warp rate and the warp width, but, at least in the parameter regime studied here, is independent of the sound speed. The characteristic magnitude of the associated angular momentum fluxes likewise increases with both the local warp rate and the radial range over which the warp extends; it also increases with increasing sound speed, but more slowly than linearly. The angular momentum fluxes respond to the warp rate after a delay that scales with the square-root of the time for sound waves to cross the radial extent of the warp. These behaviors are at variance with a number of the assumptions commonly used in analytic models to describe linear warp dynamics. Comment: 38 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

Kinetics measurements of DNA bending when in complex with the protein are essential for understanding the molecular mechanism that leads to precise recognition of specific DNA-binding sites. Previous kinetics measurements on several DNA-bending proteins used stopped-flow techniques that have limited time resolution of few milliseconds. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to probe, with submillisecond time resolution, the kinetics of bending/unbending of a DNA substrate bound to integration host factor (IHF), an architectural protein from Escherichia coli. The kinetics are monitored with time-resolved FRET, with the DNA substrates end-labeled with a FRET pair. The temperature-jump measurements, in combination with stopped-flow measurements, demonstrate that the binding of IHF to its cognate DNA site involves an intermediate state with straight or, possibly, partially bent DNA. The DNA <b>bending</b> <b>rates</b> range from ≈ 2 ms− 1 at ≈ 37 °C to ≈ 40 ms− 1 at ≈ 10 °C and correspond to an activation energy of ≈ 14 ± 3 kcal/mol.

The {{results showed that the}} optimal ways to reduce the <b>bending</b> of strain <b>rate</b> sensitive materials in ECAP without varying the strain homogeneity are the usage of lower processing speed and the increase in length of the die exit-channel...|$|R
