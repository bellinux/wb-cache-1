40|$|By {{combining}} depth-peeling with {{a linear}} formulation of a Boolean expression called <b>Blist,</b> the Blister algorithm renders an arbitrary CSG model of n primitives in at most k steps, where k {{is the number}} of depth-layers in the arrangement of the primitives. Each step starts by rendering each primitive to produce candidate surfels on the next depth-layer. Then, it renders the primitives again, one at a time, to classify the candidate surfels against the primitive and to evaluate the Boolean expression directly on the GPU. Since <b>Blist</b> does not expand the CSG expression into a disjunctive (sum-of-products) form, Blister has O(kn) time complexity. We explain the <b>Blist</b> formulation while providing algorithms for CSG-to-Blist conversion and Blist-based parallel surfel classification. We report real-time performance for nontrivial CSG models. On hardware with an 8 -bit stencil buffer, we can render all possible CSG expressions with 3909 primitives...|$|E
40|$|To {{eliminate}} the need to evaluate the intersection curves in explicit representations of surface cutouts or of trimmed faces in BReps of CSG solids, we advocate using Constructive Solid Trimming (CST). A CST face is the intersection of a surface with a <b>Blist</b> representation of a trimming CSG volume. We propose a new, GPU-based, CSG rendering algorithm, which trims the boundary of each primitive using a <b>Blist</b> of its Active Zone. This approach is faster than the previously reported Blister approach, eliminates occasional speckles of wrongly colored pixels, and provides additional capabilities: painting on surfaces, rendering semitransparent CSG models, and highlighting selected features in the BReps of CSG models...|$|E
40|$|Set {{membership}} classification algorithms visit nodes of a CSG tree {{through a}} recursive divide-and-conquer process, which stores intermediate {{results in a}} stack, whose depth equals the height, H, of the tree. During this process, the candidate sets is usually subdivided into uniform cells, whose interior is disjoint from primitives ’ boundaries. Cells inside the CSG object are identified by combining the binary results of classifying them against the primitives. In parallel systems, which allocate a different process to each leaf of the tree, and in algorithms that classify large collections of regularly spaced candidate sets (points, pixels, voxels, rays, or cross-sections) against the primitives using forward differences, a separate stack is associated with each candidate or cell. Our new representation for CSG trees, called <b>Blist,</b> distributes the merging operation to the primitives and reduces the storage requirement for each cell to log(H+ 1) bits. <b>Blist</b> can represent any Boolean expression as a list of primitives, each containing {{a reference to the}} primitive's description (type, parameter, transformation), a sign, a stamp, and a name. During set membership classification, a label is attached to each cell and passed to the successive primitives in the <b>Blist.</b> When the name written on the label matches the primitive’s name, the cell is classified against the primitive. If the result matches the primitive’s sign, the name stored in the primitive’s stamp is put on the label—if not, a zero name is used. The elimination of the intermediate CSG nodes and of the recursive merging operations make the <b>Blist</b> architecture particularly well suited for parallel hardware configurations. We provide a simple algorithm for converting CSG expressions to Blists. It uses rotations on the positive form of the tree {{to reduce the number of}} bits needed for each label...|$|E
