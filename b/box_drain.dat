Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan <b>box,</b> <b>drain</b> the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E

An ovoid brick drain running the length of Adelaide Street from Albert to Creek Street joins the culvert and carries the water to the Brisbane River. At the time of its heritage listing, it was reported that the sheer weight of the culvert appeared to hold the structure together as there was little mortar visible in the lower levels. There was however some patches of mortar visible between the blocks in the upper levels. At the western end there was some slurry build up on the floor from outside building projects but it is generally in good condition.|$|E

50|$|The {{cam shaft}} of the battery broke and the <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> for {{water from the}} river was {{insufficient}} in 1935 closing it down for repairs. The Hornsby engine was installed in February. 4,560 tons of stone were treated for a yield of 663 oz of gold. The battery operated 4,094 hours in 1936 producing 980 oz of gold from 6,951 tons of stone. G. Price at the Town View open cut had 750 tons treated at the Kidston battery for a yield of 55.77 oz of gold. The box water race from Copperfield River worked well as did the new Hornsby gas producer. 57 parcels were dealt with during the year. 66 parcels of ore were treated in 1938.

5000|$|Before the 1840s simple {{surface drains}} or covered drains {{were used in}} towns. Surface drains carried off surface water by making the road section higher in the centre than at the sides. The {{simplest}} form of covered drain was the <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> that had a broad flat bottom. These drains caused problems because it was common for the entire volume of the drain to be completely filled and blocked. Another type of covered drain was the circular or barrel drain. They were rarely used, as they were more expensive and less effective than box drains. With {{the development of the}} ovoid or [...] "egg-shaped" [...] drains there was a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness of drainage systems. John Phillips designed the first ovoid drain in the 1840s and advocated that in order to have proper drainage of towns, separate drainage systems should be used for stormwater and sewage. The ovoid drains concentrated the flow of the water {{to the bottom of the}} drain and therefore decreased the likelihood of silting and blockage. In the beginning, these drains were made of stone but by the 1870s they were mainly built of cheaper brick ...|$|E
50|$|A new {{alignment}} {{from the}} state line to Elk City {{was built in the}} late 1920s. It only coincided with the earlier route through Texola and through Sayre; the rest was entirely separate. Except in Sayre, where the city had paved the road with Portland cement (PC) in 1926, the state began paving the road in 1928 and 1929 with asphalt over a concrete base from Elk City to several miles east of Hext. It switched to PC in 1929, paving the remainder from east of Hext to the state line from 1929 to 1931. This alignment followed E1240 Road {{from the state}} line to Texola, and then the present main road through Erick and Hext to south of Sayre. The old cement lies {{in the center of the}} four-lane road through Texola, and then mainly follows the westbound lanes to Erick, through which it again lies in the center. A short abandoned piece of PC, including ruins from a former bridge over a creek, is located to the south of the road, between N1700 and N1710 Roads. Beyond Erick, the PC was again built in the present location of the westbound lanes, but has since been paved over until the I-40 interchange (exit 11). Just past exit 11, the road becomes two lanes, and the original road — mostly built as PC, but later resurfaced in asphalt, and once the westbound lanes of a divided highway - is now abandoned to the north of the open roadway; a 1928 concrete federal aid primary marker lies 0.8 mi west of Hext. Beyond Hext, where I-40 comes in from the south, the two-lane road crosses to the original roadway; the later eastbound lanes are now the westbound lanes of I-40. The 1929 alignment curved to the north into N1870 Road west of exit 20, following Main Street and Fourth Street as the original route did. However, it continued beyond Benton Boulevard to Sayre Avenue, turning off onto the present four-lane I-40 Bus. towards I-40 exit 25. Just prior to the exit, Route 66 curved northeast along the northside frontage road. It crossed to the south side after exit 26, crossing Timber Creek on a 1928 through truss bridge, and crossed again just east of the N1910 Road overpass. This part of the north frontage road, from east of N1910 Road to exit 32, retains the original 1928-1929 paving, as well as a 1926 <b>box</b> <b>drain.</b> Between exit 32 and Elk City, the original road (resurfaced) is now the westbound lanes of I-40 Bus., where another 1926 <b>box</b> <b>drain</b> still stands.|$|E

40|$|AbstractImproved {{equipment}} and husbandry practices {{are required to}} effectively grade and harvest fish in large land-based culture tanks. The objective of our work was to develop and evaluate several types of relatively inexpensive, portable, and efficient fish handling equipment to reduce the labor requirement for grading and harvesting fish from large circular culture tanks. This {{equipment and}} husbandry practices also had to provide for worker safety and minimize the stress or damage to the fish. Two techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the entire population from a large and deep circular tank, i. e. (a) purse seine and (b) carbon dioxide avoidance response. Two other techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the fish from a large (150 m 3) and deep (2. 44 m) circular culture tank after they had been top-graded in situ using a 3 -panel clam-shell grader: (c) an airlift fish pump and hand sorting/dewatering box and (d) a sidewall <b>drain</b> <b>box</b> for hand sorting/dewatering. Some of these technologies are new, while others (such as the purse seine) {{have been used in}} other applications. Our commercial-scale evaluation of these technologies provided insight into {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each option. With use of the clam-shell grader, the majority of the fish in the culture tank were never lifted from the water during the self-sorting process, which minimized stress, perhaps enhancing final product quality. In contrast, harvesting the tank using the purse seine and hand brailing was much more labor intensive and increased the stress on the fish, as indicated by a nearly 10 -fold increase in fish mortality compared to the mortality observed when the clam-shell type crowder/grader system and an airlift fish pump or sidewall <b>drain</b> <b>box</b> were used during fish harvest. The combination of the clam-shell crowder/grader with the sidewall <b>drain</b> harvest <b>box</b> was our preferred harvest method, because of its low labor requirement, relatively low fish mortality, and rapid harvest rate. We also think that the carbon dioxide avoidance harvest technique can be used effectively, with little labor input and practically zero mortality when the entire fish population must be removed from a fish culture tank, but not during a selective harvest using in situ grading. Ultimately, the more effective technologies and practices should help fish farmers overcome scale-up issues and improve land-based fish farm profitability...|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{is strong}} in compression; however, {{it is quite}} fragile in tension. To {{overcome}} this flaw, concrete is frequently reinforced with bars typically made of low grade, low carbon steel. The environment inside of concrete is favorable for steel; unfortunately when passive steel is exposed to chlorides, active corrosion can initiate, resulting in damage to the structure. One source of chloride contamination is through anti-icing agents which are used to inhibit the formation of ice on roadways, ensuring safe driving conditions. This represents a serious concern from both the cost associated with rehabilitation (Canadian infrastructure deficit in 2003 was $ 125 billion [1]) and as a safety concern to the public. In Canada, 5 million tonnes of road salts are used each year [2], of which Ontario uses 500 to 600 thousand tonnes [3]. As a result, the Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) has requested a study of four frequently used anti-icing agents: 25. 5 % NaCl, 31. 5 % MgCl 2, 37. 9 % CaCl 2 and 32. 6 % multi Cl- (12 % NaCl, 4 % MgCl 2 and 16 % CaCl 2). The objective {{of the study is}} two-fold, the first is comparing the effects of the solutions on steel embedded in concrete (high pH environment) and the second is to compare the effects of the anti-icing agents to a variety of construction steels in atmospheric conditions (neutral pH). Macro-cell and micro-cell corrosion in concrete were tested using both modified ASTM G 109 prisms and concrete beams with 6 embedded black steel bars. Unfortunately, these tests proved inconclusive; all of the steel remained passive. This was a result of casting a high quality concrete in laboratory conditions which ultimately lead to minimal diffusion of the anti-icing solutions. Therefore, it is recommended that for short term corrosion testing (< 2 years), poor quality concrete or cement paste should be used. Micro-cell testing in synthetic concrete pore solution contaminated with the anti-icing solutions was conducted in order to obtain results in the period of the M. A. Sc. program and to directly observe the corrosion. The initial concentration of Cl- in each solution was 0. 00 % Cl-; this was incrementally increased by 0. 005 % Cl-/week. Potentiostatic linear polarization to resistance measurements and pH measurements were used to monitor the corrosion on a weekly basis. The results of this test showed that MgCl 2 has the most detrimental effects due to the drop in pH (from 13. 5 to 9. 1) caused by Mg replacing Ca in Ca(OH) 2 to form the less soluble Mg(OH) 2. The transition from passive to active corrosion initiated at 0. 7, 0. 4 - 0. 9, 0. 6 and 0. 6 % Cl- for NaCl, MgCl 2, CaCl 2 and multi Cl-, respectively. The active corrosion current densities were 11 mA/m 2 for NaCl, CaCl 2 and multi Cl-, whereas MgCl 2 had active corrosion rates of ~ 100 mA/m 2. One bar exposed to CaCl 2 showed corrosion rates as high as 600 mA/m 2. This was a result of crevice corrosion between the shrink fitting and the rebar. Once the expansive corrosion products broke through the shrink fitting and ample supply of oxygen became available, allowing the corrosion rates to spike dramatically. The following steels were tested directly in the diluted solution in a cyclic corrosion chamber: stainless steels: 304 L, 316 LM, 2101, 2205, 2304, XM 28; corrosion resistant steel reinforcing bars (rebar) : galvanized rebar, guard rail (galvanized plate steel) and MMFX; carbon steels: black steel rebar, <b>box</b> girder, <b>drain,</b> weathering steel. The reinforcing bars were virgin steels whereas the remaining steels were components from the field. The testing regime followed SAE J 2334 using the anti-icing solutions diluted to 3 % by wt. Cl- as the immersion liquid. Unfortunately, the mutli Cl- solution was not tested due to time constraints. The mass change per unit area was measured every five cycles. All stainless steels exposed to all anti-icing solutions exhibited similar changes in mass per unit area, less than 10 g/m 2. All plain carbon steels including weathering steel exhibited mass changes per unit area of more than 1000 g/m 2 with some variability between the various anti-icing solutions and steel types, although the black steel rebar typically outperformed the other carbon steels. The corrosion products of MMFX were non-adherent, resulting in inconclusive results. The galvanized layer on the guard rail, which had been exposed to the environment in service, proved to be more protective than the fresh zinc coating on the galvanized rebar. When exposed to the MgCl 2 solution, the mass change of both new and used galvanized steels was comparable to that found in the stainless steels. When exposed to NaCl solutions, the galvanized guard rail also exhibited this trend, whereas the new galvanic coating did not, suggesting that with exposure to the atmosphere a galvanic coating will protect the steel against NaCl. In all cases galvanized steel exposed to CaCl 2 solutions exhibited mass changes per unit area of less than 100 g/m 2 this is considered moderate, as this value is one order of magnitude higher than the stainless steels and one order of magnitude lower than the carbon steels exposed to the same test. It is recommended that galvanic coatings be utilized in areas heavily exposed to anti-icing solutions. The weathering steel offers no advantages over carbon steels when directly exposed to anti-icing solutions. Furthermore, in areas with high amounts of exposed galvanized steel, CaCl 2 should be avoided. Between the four solutions tested, NaCl solutions are recommended as the anti-icing agents that, overall, causes the least amount of damage to both the reinforcing steel in concrete and to exposed metallic components. NaCl is followed by multi Cl- and CaCl 2. Even though MgCl 2 causes less damage when directly exposed to carbon steels and galvanized steels than CaCl 2, {{it is much easier to}} repair external components than internal components. Therefore, MgCl 2 is not recommended...|$|R
