5|$|Edward now {{expected}} Isabella {{and their}} son to return to England, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage {{appears to have been}} successful, {{but by the time the}} Queen left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's. She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given the custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he falls into a dangerous coma. Hoping {{to find a cure}} for her partner, Scully rushes to Africa and discovers a massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the ocean. Skinner and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) desperately attempt to find the truth behind the alien object. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner.

5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{development}} of the first game, the female Shepard was given equal importance as the male counterpart; unique lines were written for her as well as a unique romance option. In fact, the early model for animation tests featured a female Shepard. When describing her, Casey Hudson said [...] "she's not a caricature of the idea of role-playing as a female, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she's</b> very impressive as a strong female character that's sensitive yet extremely confident and assertive".|$|R
60|$|Jane {{looked as}} if she did not mean to be conquered; <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> of answering, <b>she</b> began {{speaking}} again to Mr. John Knightley.|$|R

25|$|Scarborough was an East Indiaman {{launched}} in December 1734 that performed two voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). The Admiralty purchased her in 1739 and commissioned her as HMS Scarborough.

25|$|At dawn, Venus sets {{a second}} task for Psyche. She is {{to cross a}} river and fetch golden wool from violent sheep who graze on the other side.

According to a news broadcast Drake sees after waking from her gunshot wound operation in 2008, Hunt's undiscovered grave was recently found by a group of travellers.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, John {{was chosen}} to marry his first cousin, the 20-year-old Eleanor of Austria, eldest {{daughter}} of Philip the Handsome of Austria-Burgundy and Queen Joanna of Castile, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> married his widowed father Manuel. John took deep offence at this: his chroniclers say he became melancholic and was never quite the same. Some historians also claim {{this was one of}} the main reasons that John later became fervently religious, giving him name the Pious (Portuguese: o Piedoso).|$|E
5000|$|Margareta (played by Anna-Carin Franzén) has a {{chocolate}}-wheel at the Christmas market, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> {{of chocolate}} <b>she</b> gives the winners carrots because [...] "det är nyttigare" [...] ("it's more nutritious").|$|R

25|$|It transpired that Dyer {{was expecting}} her new client (the decoy) to call, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> found detectives waiting on her doorstep. On 3 April (Good Friday), police raided her home. They were {{apparently}} {{struck by the}} stench of human decomposition, although no human remains were found. There was, however, plenty of other related evidence, including white edging tape, telegrams regarding adoption arrangements, pawn tickets for children's clothing, receipts for advertisements and letters from mothers inquiring about the well-being of their children.|$|E
25|$|Manticore {{reinforces}} {{the system in}} time to greet the “visiting” Haven task force, who leave after a suitable interval to inform Haven of failure.

25|$|Nilsson began {{preparations}} for the 2006 European Athletics Championships, held in her native Sweden in Gothenburg, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> decided to finish her career as she had tired of the sport. Her Lumberjacks coach John Hayes later remarked how Nilsson's dedication to running had wavered – she would work intensely in training, but other times would completely miss large segments of training, opting to travel instead, for which she retained a great interest. Nilsson committed suicide in 2013, dying {{at the age of}} thirty.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>instead</b> of this <b>she</b> {{paused to}} hear Mrs. Rowe declare {{he was a}} bad 'un, with a nasty sulky temper {{that no one could}} do nothing with, and just then she saw Florence Cray {{crossing}} the village green.|$|R
25|$|Lilya {{lives with}} her mother in a {{run-down}} apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union (principal filming took place in Paldiski, Estonia).

25|$|In 1946, Empire Cromer {{was sold}} to the Donaldson Line, Glasgow and renamed Corrientes, the second ship of that name to serve with Donaldson Line. In 1954, Corrientes {{was sold to}} the Blue Star Line. It was {{intended}} {{that she would be}} renamed Oakland Star, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> was declared surplus to requirements.

On 3 April 1962, Inchmay ran aground at Wakayama, Japan. There were no injuries amongst her 45 crew.

25|$|After he {{attained}} arhatship, {{he began}} to think deeply of his parents, and wondered what happened to them. He used his clairvoyance to see where they were reborn and found his father in the heavenly realms i.e. {{the realm of the}} gods. However, his mother had been reborn in a lower realm, known as Avīci, or the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. His mother took on the form of a hungry ghost (preta)– so called because it could not eat due to its highly thin and fragile throat in which no food could pass through, yet it was always hungry because it had a fat belly. His mother had been greedy with the money he left her. He had instructed her to kindly host any Buddhist monks that ever came her way, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> withheld her kindness and her money. It was for this reason she was reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> didn't. <b>Instead</b> <b>she</b> saw every dahlia {{carefully}} {{tied up in}} a newspaper, {{and over}} all the beds newspapers spread out and held neatly in place with pebbles.

Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, <b>but</b> <b>instead,</b> <b>she</b> finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E
500|$|Within days of {{completing}} {{her work in}} Gone with the Wind in June 1939, deHavilland returned to Warner Bros. and began filming Michael Curtiz's historical drama The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex with Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. She had hoped her work on Selznick's prestige picture would lead to first-rate roles at Warner Bros., <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> received third billing below the title as the queen's lady-in-waiting. In early September, she was lent out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Sam Wood's romantic caper film Raffles with David Niven, about a high-society cricketer and jewel thief.

Teachers told her she would never amount to anything: she would be promiscuous, have children out of wedlock, become an alcoholic, and do no better than find a job in childcare. She begged {{to go to a}} school where she could get higher education and become a teacher, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>she</b> was transferred to a boarding school where she was taught how to work with young children. After two years of training she was unable to find employment, although her white roommate immediately found a position.|$|E

Currently living with Runa, as the adult she tries to teach Runa to act more childlike, <b>but</b> <b>instead,</b> <b>she's</b> the only one who ever ends up doing what she's told. Be that as it may, she doesn't harbor any ill will towards Runa for being so assertive, and occasionally even admires the way she carries herself with such distinction. Rather, she has to desperately resist the urge to come out by reminding herself, [...] "That girl is your student!". Before meeting Rena, she lived with her mother and her unknown brother.|$|R
