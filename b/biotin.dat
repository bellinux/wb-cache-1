5|$|Microbes {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that {{live within the}} human digestive system contribute to human health through gut immunity, the synthesis of vitamins such as folic acid and <b>biotin,</b> and the fermentation of complex indigestible carbohydrates.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and <b>biotin,</b> and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., <b>biotin</b> in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and <b>biotin,</b> convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, <b>biotin</b> is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> {{deficiency}} is rare. The amounts needed are small, a {{wide range}} of foods contain <b>biotin,</b> and intestinal bacteria synthesize <b>biotin,</b> which is then absorbed by the host animal. For that reason, statutory agencies in many countries, for example the USA and Australia, have not formally established a recommended daily intake of <b>biotin.</b> Instead, an Adequate Intake (AI) is identified based on the theory that average intake meets needs. Future research could result in <b>biotin</b> AIs with EARs and RDAs (see Dietary Reference Intake section).|$|E
25|$|In mammals <b>biotin</b> is {{imported}} into cells by the Na+-dependent multivitamin (pantothenate, <b>biotin,</b> lipoate) transporter (SMVT).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} rare {{metabolic}} disorders exist {{in which an}} individual's metabolism of <b>biotin</b> is abnormal, such as deficiency in the holocarboxylase synthetase enzyme which covalently links <b>biotin</b> onto the carboxylase, where the <b>biotin</b> acts as a cofactor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> is {{synthesized}} by intestinal bacteria, {{but there}} is a lack of good quality studies about how much <b>biotin</b> they provide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> {{deficiency}} typically occurs from dietary {{absence of}} the vitamin. Daily consumption of raw egg whites for several months may result in <b>biotin</b> deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant {{women tend}} to have a higher risk of <b>biotin</b> deficiency. Nearly half of {{pregnant}} women have abnormal increases of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, which reflects reduced status of <b>biotin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The wide {{variability}} in <b>biotin</b> bioavailability {{may be due}} to the ability of an organism to break various biotin-protein bonds from food. Whether an organism has an enzyme with that ability will determine the bioavailability of <b>biotin</b> from the foodstuff.|$|E
25|$|Concerning organic requirements, most {{strains of}} S. cerevisiae require <b>biotin.</b> Indeed, a S. cerevisiae-based growth assay laid the {{foundation}} for the isolation, crystallisation, and later structural determination of <b>biotin.</b> Most strains also require pantothenate for full growth. In general, S. cerevisiae is prototrophic for vitamins.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{egg whites}} contain a protein (avidin) that blocks the {{absorption}} of <b>biotin,</b> so people who regularly consume {{a large number of}} eggs may become biotin-deficient. The dietary <b>biotin</b> intake in Western populations has been estimated to be 35 to 70micrograms per day (143–287nmol per day).|$|E
25|$|In bacteria, several {{families}} of proteins, especially the BioY family of transporters, imports <b>biotin</b> into cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> is a {{water-soluble}} B-vitamin, {{also called}} vitamin B7 and {{formerly known as}} vitamin H or coenzyme R.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with {{hereditary}} disorders of <b>biotin</b> deficiency {{have evidence}} of impaired immune system function, including increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> is also {{available}} in dietary supplements, as an ingredient in multi-vit/min products or as a biotin-containing supplement with health benefit claims.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect <b>biotin</b> metabolism. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning or skin rash typically on the face. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984 and today many countries test for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, thus the true prevalence of the disorder is unknown.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the strongest}} non-covalent interactions, the binding of <b>biotin</b> to {{streptavidin}} is commonly used as the target molecular interaction in the research of biosensors and cell sorting.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of cradle cap {{appears to be a}} common manifestation of <b>biotin</b> insufficiency. This may be due, in part, to the {{influence}} of <b>biotin</b> on fatty acid biosynthesis. Possibly {{it has to do with}} overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release a greasy substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry. There may be a relationship with skin yeasts (Pityrosporum ovale, newly renamed Malassezia furfur). Seborrheic dermatitis is the adult version of cradle cap.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biotin</b> binds {{tightly to}} the tetrameric protein avidin (also {{streptavidin}} and neutravidin), with a dissociation constant Kd {{on the order}} of 10−15 M, {{which is one of the}} strongest known protein-ligand interactions. This is often used in different biotechnological applications. Until 2005, very harsh conditions were thought to be required to break the biotin-streptavidin bond.|$|E
25|$|Insufficient vitamin B12 {{can lead}} to {{excessive}} dryness, darkened nails, and rounded or curved nail ends. Insufficient intake of both vitamin A and B results in fragile nails with horizontal and vertical ridges. Some over-the-counter vitamin supplements such as certain multivitamins and <b>biotin</b> may help in growth of strong nails, although this is quite subjective.|$|E
25|$|Inherited {{metabolic}} disorders {{characterized by}} deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include {{deficiencies in the}} enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase or biotinidase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using <b>biotin</b> effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, skin rash, feeding problems, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma.|$|E
25|$|Addition {{of extra}} {{nitrogen}} generally decreases cellulose production while addition of precursor molecules such as amino acids and methionine improved yield. Pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid and <b>biotin</b> are vitamins important for cellulose production whereas pantothenate and riboflavin have opposing effects. In reactors where {{the process is}} more complex, water-soluble polysaccharides such as agar, acetan, and sodium alginate are added to prevent clumping or coagulation of bacterial cellulose.|$|E
25|$|Affinity {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very robust. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of proteins bound to tags. These fusion proteins are labeled with compounds such as His-tags, <b>biotin</b> or antigens, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{alcoholic}} beverages can also contain congeners that {{may also be}} bioactive; therefore, the consumption of varying {{alcoholic beverages}} may result in different health consequences. An individual’s nutritional intake also {{plays a role in}} the development of this disease. Depending on the specific dietary habits, they may have a deficiency of one or more of the following: thiamine (vitamin B1), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid and <b>biotin,</b> vitamin B12, folic acid, niacin (vitamin B3), and vitamin A.|$|E
25|$|These {{bacteria}} {{also produce}} {{large amounts of}} vitamins, especially vitamin K and <b>biotin</b> (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. Although this source of vitamins, in general, provides {{only a small part}} of the daily requirement, it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. An individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Minerals or milk salts, are {{traditional}} names {{for a variety}} of cations and anions within bovine milk. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chlorine are all included as minerals and they typically occur at concentration of 5–40 mM. The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate. In addition to calcium, milk is a good source of many other vitamins. Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, K, E, thiamine, niacin, <b>biotin,</b> riboflavin, folates, and pantothenic acid are all present in milk.|$|E
25|$|For U.S. {{food and}} dietary {{supplement}} labeling purposes {{the amount in}} a serving is expressed {{as a percent of}} Daily Value (%DV). For <b>biotin</b> labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 300 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 30 μg to bring it into agreement with the AI. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women and men over age 18 the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 40 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 40 μg/day, for lactation 45 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35 μg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in United States - that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for <b>biotin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B was {{originally}} {{considered to have}} two components, a heat-labile vitamin B1 and a heat-stable vitamin B2. In the 1920s, vitamin B2 {{was thought to be}} the factor necessary for preventing pellagra. In 1923, Paul Gyorgy in Heidelberg was investigating egg-white injury in rats; the curative factor for this condition was called vitamin H (which is now called <b>biotin</b> or vitamin B7). Since both pellagra and vitamin H deficiency were associated with dermatitis, Gyorgy decided to test the effect of vitamin B2 on vitamin H deficiency in rats. He enlisted the service of Wagner-Jauregg in Kuhn’s laboratory. In 1933, Kuhn, Gyorgy, and Wagner found that thiamin-free extracts of yeast, liver, or rice bran prevented the growth failure of rats fed a thiamin-supplemented diet.|$|E
25|$|Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively {{measured}} by northern blotting, which provides size and sequence {{information about the}} mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an autoradiograph. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and <b>biotin</b> chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern blotting are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in {{an image of a}} gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including <b>biotin,</b> folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. It is important to emphasize that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), <b>biotin,</b> and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using <b>biotin</b> and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E
