5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> into the food chain.|$|E

5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He {{shows that the}} shape of the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2009, {{a second}} motion {{to recall the}} bill from committee, {{initiated}} by Senator Les Ihara, Jr., was successful after 10Democrats voted in favor. The Senate Democratic Leadership, Democrats opposed to civil unions, and Senate Republicans {{voted in favor of}} an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between civil unions and marriage and allowing same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter civil unions. The amendment was adopted, which killed the bill, as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Legislature adjourned May 8, 2009. Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> again before 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{matter of}} {{cooperation}} had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> {{at the highest}} level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, {{to work with the}} Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, {{and the head of the}} British Mission.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes {{in the last}} phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he {{took part in the}} battle of Gniew. His involvement in this conflict, which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, was rather limited, and he spent much time {{in other parts of the}} country. During that period and afterward, he lobbied for support of his candidature for the Polish throne, as his father, Sigismund, was getting more advanced in his age, and the succession to the Polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through the process of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father Sigismund, tried to ensure Władysław's election during Sigismund's life, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. Sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the issue to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> again.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows a tendency to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of}} a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{assembling}} NAD de novo {{from simple}} amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors {{used in these}} salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> from the diet and are termed vitamin B or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for {{the high level of}} reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD+ levels | journal = J.

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by those that followed on from his work.|$|E

5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{there was very little}} patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E
5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host {{is not an easy}} task though, despite the fact that several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E

The bill {{moved back to the}} House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say, requiring a vote of two-thirds of Representatives to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> again in 2010, and was considered dead. In April 2010, {{on the last day of}} the legislative session, the House suspended the rules on the Senate bill and passed it with a majority, sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle, who vetoed it in July 2010.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the RNZAF {{considered}} options to replace or upgrade its A-4Ks. A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France, the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft, and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals {{to upgrade the}} Skyhawks. After {{the decision was made}} to disband the RAN's fighter force, the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A-4Gs and spare parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $NZ40 million. The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of this deal on 5 September 1983. A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A-4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition. The commander of the RNZAF, Air Vice-Marshal David Crooks, favoured purchasing the A-4Gs and then upgrading the entire A-4 fleet over the alternative of buying new aircraft, as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force's capabilities. He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up,</b> and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984. As part of the purchase agreement, the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service.|$|E
5|$|Nasmyth {{was also}} a highly {{influential}} teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included Andrew Wilson (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist Hugh William Williams (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845). Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work Fast Castle from Below (1824). Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of Walter Scott. Knox's Landscape with Tourists at Lock Katrine (c. 1820), was a commentary on the tourist trade that {{grew up in the}} Trossachs {{in the aftermath of the}} publication of Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake in 1810. He {{was also a}}mong the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow. Towards the end of his career he undertook panoramic works of the views from the top of Ben Lomond, which played a part in opening up the Highlands as a spectacle that would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> by artists in the second half of the century.|$|E
