5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, <b>barrel-shaped</b> {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands {{can be found in the}} surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) {{though they may}} be as large as 4mm in the case of Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are <b>barrel-shaped</b> or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished.|$|E
5|$|Kumi-daiko performance, {{characterized}} by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of Daihachi Oguchi and has continued with groups such as Kodo. Other performance styles, such as hachijō-daiko, have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. Kumi-daiko performance groups are active not only in Japan, {{but also in the}} United States, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, form, stick grip, clothing, and the particular instrumentation. Ensembles typically use different types of <b>barrel-shaped</b> nagadō-daiko as well as smaller shime-daiko. Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|Snow gauge: The {{first use}} of snow gauges were {{precipitation}} gauges that was widely used in 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. The Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao records the use of gathering rain and snowfall measurements in the Song mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book discusses the use of large conical or <b>barrel-shaped</b> snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei {{is a large}} eomyid, {{though not}} as large as Megapeomys lindsayi and M.bobwilsoni. Megapeomys repenningi from Japan is similar in size, but its cheekteeth are not as high-crowned. A.savagei shows a series of traits that are {{characteristic}} for the apeomyines: high-crowned cheekteeth with thick enamel that are bilophodont (divided into two lobes) in form and a very long diastema (gap) between the lower incisor and cheekteeth. However, the cheekteeth are higher-crowned than those of other apeomyines, including Apeomys, Megapeomys, and Arikareeomys, and they are rectangular in shape, while other apeomyines have <b>barrel-shaped</b> teeth. Similarly, the oldest apeomyine, Zophoapeomys, is smaller and has lower-crowned cheekteeth. The known material of Apeomyoides consists {{of a number of}} fragmentary mandibles (lower jaws) and isolated cheekteeth. The length of the first and second lower molars (m1 and m2) ranges from 1.74 to 2.58 mm, the width from 2.08 to 2.33 mm.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a <b>barrel-shaped</b> chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape {{is one of}} the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on <b>barrel-shaped</b> basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging <b>barrel-shaped</b> pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is {{believed}} that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or <b>barrel-shaped,</b> 6–15mm tall, 4–8mm wide at the mouth, {{sometimes}} short-stalked, {{golden brown}} to blackish brown in age. The outside {{wall of the}} peridium, the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a tomentum) may be completely worn off. The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes C.stercoreus is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus Nidula.|$|E
5|$|Tianchi Basins: As {{precipitation}} was {{for important}} agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao developed a precipitation gauge that was {{widely used in}} 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement. Tianchi Basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were conical or <b>barrel-shaped</b> with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding {{has always been a}} problem in China.|$|E
25|$|Chaperonins are {{characterized}} by their <b>barrel-shaped</b> structure with binding sites for client proteins inside the barrels.|$|E
25|$|File:Opisthoproctus soleatus.png|The Barreleye has <b>barrel-shaped,</b> tubular eyes {{which are}} {{generally}} directed upwards {{but can be}} swivelled forward.|$|E
25|$|Each domain {{comprises}} two β-pleated sheets. The {{sheets are}} linked by a disulfide bridge and together form a roughly <b>barrel-shaped</b> structure {{known as a}} β-barrel.|$|E
25|$|The Dawula is a <b>barrel-shaped</b> drum, and it {{was used}} as a {{companion}} drum in the past, to keep strict time with the beat.|$|E
25|$|The eggs of tessaratomids are <b>barrel-shaped</b> or globular. The eggs {{exhibit a}} ring of small protuberances, known as micropylar process, which permit entry of sperm for {{fertilization}} into the eggs (through micropylar canals). They also provide openings for air for the developing embryos.|$|E
25|$|This process uses {{multiple}} diamond-plated, <b>barrel-shaped</b> {{tools to}} finish a bore. The tool has a single layer of diamonds bonded to the tool, with about half of each diamond exposed. These special tools are made to a specific diameter and are only meant {{to open up the}} hole to that size.|$|E
25|$|These {{fish are}} named {{because of their}} <b>barrel-shaped,</b> tubular eyes, which are {{generally}} directed upwards to detect the silhouettes of available prey; however, according to Robison and Reisenbichler, these fish are capable of directing their eyes forward, as well. The family name Opisthoproctidae {{is derived from the}} Greek words opisthe ("behind") and proktos ("anus").|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Sawyer and Maley {{used the}} Kebara 2 ribcage and pelvis in their full {{reconstruction}} of a Neanderthal skeleton. This {{was the first}} time a Neanderthal ribcage was rebuilt. The lower rib area flared, giving the whole ribcage a bell-shaped appearance, rather than the <b>barrel-shaped</b> one Neanderthals were for {{a century and a half}} thought to have had.|$|E
25|$|The Stipa-Caproni, also {{generally}} {{called the}} Caproni Stipa, was an experimental Italian aircraft designed in 1932 by Luigi Stipa (1900–1992) and built by Caproni. It featured a hollow, <b>barrel-shaped</b> fuselage {{with the engine}} and propeller completely enclosed by the fuselage—in essence, the whole fuselage was a single ducted fan. Although the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) {{was not interested in}} pursuing development of the Stipa-Caproni, its design was an important step in the development of jet propulsion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the South Stand terrace {{was covered}} with a wooden <b>barrel-shaped</b> roof and {{came to be known as}} the Scratching Shed. Another stand was built on the east side {{terracing}} called the Lowfields. Behind the goal at the north end was a terrace known as the Spion Kop, or simply Kop, from a hill in South Africa on which 322 British soldiers lost their lives in the Battle of Spion Kop, in January 1900, in the Boer War.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{cast iron}} posts support {{galleries}} with painted panelled fronts which extend {{for the full}} length of the nave on each side. The ceiling is <b>barrel-shaped,</b> with pine trusses, and is painted orange and brown. The apse has stained glass windows designed by Henry Holiday and made by James Powell and Sons, and windows in the aisles include three produced by Savell {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century, and one by Walter Tower of Kempe & Co., dated 1910, which honours Prebendary Arthur Perfect.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the diadectomorphs, the terrestrial forms were moderately sized creatures that appeared in the early Carboniferous. The vertebrae of the group foreshadowed that of primitive reptiles, with small pleurocentra, which grew and fused to become the true centrum in later vertebrates. The most well known genus is Seymouria. Some members of the most advanced group, the Diadectomorpha, were herbivorous and grew to several meters in length, with great, <b>barrel-shaped</b> bodies. Small relatives of the diadectomorphs gave rise to the first reptiles in the Late Carboniferous.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{decline in}} Antarctic krill biomass {{may have been}} caused by the reduction of the pack ice zone due to global warming. Antarctic krill, especially {{in the early stages of}} development, seem to need the pack ice structures in order to have a fair chance of survival. The pack ice provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low pack ice conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a <b>barrel-shaped</b> free-floating filter feeder that also grazes on plankton.|$|E
25|$|Lodner D. Phillips {{designed}} the first wholly enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a <b>barrel-shaped</b> upper torso with domed ends and included {{ball and socket}} joints in the articulated arms and legs. The arms had joints at shoulder and elbow, and the legs at knee and hip. The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing port, entrance through a manhole cover on top, a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators {{at the ends of}} the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, Phillips' suit was ever constructed.|$|E
25|$|A {{row counter}} for hand {{knitting}} is a tally counter for counting rows or courses worked, for counting stitch pattern repetitions, or for counting increases or decreases {{of the number}} of stitches in consecutive rows. The first commercially produced one appeared on the market in the 1920s after the general public started regularly knitting from unfamiliar printed and complex patterns. Design variations include on-needle <b>barrel-shaped</b> counters for straight-needle work, stitch-marker counters for knitting on double-pointed and circular needles, complex counters which attempted to assist with decreases, increases and lacework, stand-alone hand-held counters in imitation of the hand-tally, pendant counters worn round the neck and online software for iPhones.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in compact clusters. They may be round or <b>barrel-shaped</b> with a lid or a cap {{at the top}} (known as the operculum). They also contain a ring of small protuberances near the cap called micropylar processes. They permit the passage of sperm into the egg for {{fertilization}} and enable gaseous exchange from within the egg and the outside world for the embryos. The eggs are white or cream colored when freshly laid but can change color as the embryo matures. When hatching, the prolarva (the advanced embryo) exit the egg by opening the lid through peristaltic movements {{and with the help}} of a T-shaped internal structure in the egg (known as the egg burster).|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to the older engine, {{the position of the}} inlet trumpets and exhaust manifolds had been switched, so that the exhausts exited on the upper surface of the engine, within the cylinder vee, and the inlets protruded above the chassis pontoons {{on either side of the}} car. Between the chassis pontoons the engine was covered with a removable, curved panel. Completing the engine cowling was a near-circular gearbox and differential cover at the rear, through which the tail pipes of the exhausts protruded. Shifting the inlets to the outer edges of the car allowed the engine to ingest cooler, denser air, boosting the motor's power output. The compact exhaust bundle also allowed a svelte packaging of the engine bay. However, the heat build-up from the confined manifold necessitated cutting a hole in the top of the engine cover. Despite this, the BRM P261's <b>barrel-shaped</b> rear end became one of its most distinctive visual characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{are typically}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles. Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber. A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims {{by means of a}} long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a <b>barrel-shaped</b> body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.|$|E
25|$|While most labyrinthodonts {{remained}} aquatic or semi-aquatic, {{some of the}} reptile-like amphibians {{adapted to}} explore the terrestrial ecological niches as small or medium-sized predators. They evolved increasingly terrestrial adaptions during the Carboniferous, including stronger vertebrae and slender limbs, and a deeper skull with laterally placed eyes. They probably had watertight skin, possibly covered with a horny epidermis overlaying small bony nodules, forming scutes, {{similar to those found}} in modern caecilians. To the modern eye, these animals would appear like heavyset, lizards betraying their amphibious nature only by their lack of claws and by spawning aquatic eggs. In the middle or late Carboniferous, smaller forms gave rise to the first reptiles. In the late Carboniferous, a global rainforest collapse favoured the more terrestrially adapted reptiles, while the many of their amphibian relatives failed to reestablish. Some reptile-like amphibians did flourish in the new seasonal environment. The reptilomorph family Diadectidae evolved herbivory, becoming the largest terrestrial animals of the day with <b>barrel-shaped,</b> heavy bodies. There were also a family of correspondingly large carnivores, the Limnoscelidae, that flourished briefly in the late Carboniferous.|$|E
500|$|It had {{an ornate}} basin, a marble cannon <b>barrel-shaped</b> spout, {{topped by a}} bronze statue of Neptune holding a trident in one hand, {{with the other hand}} resting on an {{escutcheon}} containing Wignacourt's coat of arms. The statue is based on the Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune. The marble of the spout has a Latin inscription which says: ...|$|E
500|$|Like other sauropods, Opisthocoelicaudia had a {{small head}} on a long neck, a <b>barrel-shaped</b> body on four {{columnar}} limbs, and a long tail. It was relatively small for a sauropod; the type specimen was estimated at [...] to [...] from the head {{to the tip of}} the tail. The body mass has been estimated at , , , [...] and [...] in separate studies.|$|E
500|$|Common hippos are {{recognisable}} {{by their}} <b>barrel-shaped</b> torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults average [...] and [...] {{for males and}} females respectively, making them the largest species of land mammal after the three species of elephant and the white and Indian rhinoceros. Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running [...] over short distances.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{influences}} on Netherlandish art are first {{apparent in the}} late 15th century, {{when some of the}} painters began to travel south. This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, [...] "picturesque gables, bloated, <b>barrel-shaped</b> columns, droll cartouches, 'twisted' figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours – actually employ the visual language of Mannerism". Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result, painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.|$|E
500|$|The Cyrus Cylinder is a <b>barrel-shaped</b> {{cylinder}} {{of baked}} clay measuring [...] by [...] at its maximum diameter. It {{was created in}} several stages around a cone-shaped core of clay within which there are large grey stone inclusions. It was built up with extra layers of clay {{to give it a}} cylindrical shape before a fine surface slip of clay was added to the outer layer, on which the text is inscribed. It was excavated in several fragments, having apparently broken apart in antiquity. Today it exists in two main fragments, known as [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B", which were reunited in 1972.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Microbes", which {{consists}} of call-and-response shehnai parts and was partly based on the raga Darbari Kanada. The waltz-time [...] "Red Lady Too" [...] includes what musicologist Walter Everett describes as [...] "'Moonlight' Sonata-like suspensions on piano, honky-tonk piano, Mellotron, and drums". Ashton performed the tack piano part, with Barham supplying the lower-register piano accompaniment. On [...] "Tabla and Pakavaj", Mahapurush Misra played {{the two types of}} hand drums named in the title, the <b>barrel-shaped</b> pakhavaj being another mainstay of Hindustani classical music. [...] "In the Park" [...] features Sharma's santoor alternating solos with surbahar and tabla tarang. Neither of these last two tracks appears in the film.|$|E
500|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that taiko were used in Japan {{as early as the}} 6th century CE, during {{the latter part of the}} Kofun period, and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals. This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture. Two of these figures are depicted playing drums; one of them, wearing skins, is equipped with a <b>barrel-shaped</b> drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height. This statue is titled [...] "Man Beating the Taiko" [...] and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan. Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions.|$|E
