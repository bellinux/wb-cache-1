500|$|Several of Rivera's colleagues credit {{him with}} popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen, who adopted the pitch {{later in his}} career, said, [...] "I think he's been an {{influence}} on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [...] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, <b>but</b> <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> talk about {{the evolution of the}} cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody's throwing one. And they hate it." [...] Al Leiter, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: [...] "Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|Some campaigning by party {{workers of}} the True Finns caused {{controversy}} over {{the nature of their}} actions. Most complaints emanated from the Helsinki region. Jussi Saramo of the Left Alliance in the Uusimaa electoral district said of their actions that [...] " [...] I have been involved in politics for 12 years and I have never seen such excesses." [...] This followed an event in Korso in Vantaa where he parked his campaign trailer in a spot the True Finns said was reserved for party chairman Timo Soini. True Finns' candidate Mika Niikko however said those involved in the spat were no longer working for his campaign and he apologised to Saramo despite maintaining his stance that the placement of the trailer was a deliberate provocation: [...] "I do not approve of being provoked when someone tries to provoke;" [...] he also added that the volunteers working for the True Finns campaign come [...] "from here and there" [...] and {{it was not possible to}} verify everyone beforehand. He further added a claim that True Finns supporters have also been targets of aggressive behaviour. [...] "A month ago we were not verbally abused, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> can hear all kinds of language." [...] The Social Democrats' foreign-born candidate Ranbir Sodhi was allegedly confronted by True Finns supporters in the Myyrmäki district of Vantaa who were said to have told him to go back [...] "to his own country" [...] where he could become a politician. A week after the confrontations, however, he said that [...] "the same guys came to Tikkurila to apologise." [...] The National Coalition Party MP Raija Vahasalo also complained that during a campaign event in Kirkkonummi the True Finns handed out leaflets at the same time that claimed she favoured Swedish-speaking residents in allocating local school funding. The action was due to two local members of the True Finns who are not running to become MPs. The chairman of Kirkkonummi True Finns and a candidate in the election Pekka Sinisalo said he confiscated the remainder of the leaflets. [...] "I do not approve of attacking Vahasalo’s person. Election fever sometimes leads to these kinds of excesses." [...] This was controversial as negative campaigning is unusual in Finnish elections. In response to such actions the party secretaries of the largest political parties held a meeting to discuss certain ground rules for the rest of the campaign, however the True Finns' Ossi Sandvik could not make it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} been both criticized and praised for its {{handling}} of subject matter, including the portrayal of harsh interrogation techniques, commonly classified as torture. The use of these techniques was long kept secret by the Bush administration. (See Torture Memos.) Glenn Greenwald, in The Guardian, stated that the film takes a pro-torture stance, describing it as [...] "pernicious propaganda" [...] and stating that it [...] "presents torture as its CIA proponents and administrators see it: as a dirty, ugly business {{that is necessary to}} protect America." [...] Critic Frank Bruni concluded that the film appears to suggest [...] "No waterboarding, no Bin Laden". Jesse David Fox writes that the film [...] "doesn't explicitly say that torture caught bin Laden, but in portraying torture as one part of the successful search, it can be read that way." [...] Emily Bazelon said, [...] "The filmmakers didn't set out to be Bush-Cheney apologists", but [...] "they adopted a close-to-the-ground point of view, and perhaps they're in denial about how far down the path to condoning torture this led them." [...] Journalist Michael Wolff slammed the film as a [...] "nasty piece of pulp and propaganda" [...] and Bigelow as a [...] "fetishist and sadist" [...] for distorting history with a pro-torture viewpoint. Wolff disputed the efficacy of torture and the claim that it contributed to the discovery of bin Laden. In an open letter, social critic and feminist Naomi Wolf criticized Bigelow for claiming the film was [...] "part documentary" [...] and speculated over the reasons for Bigelow's [...] "amoral compromising" [...] of film-making, suggesting that the more pro-military a film, the easier it is to acquire Pentagon support for scenes involving expensive, futuristic military equipment. Wolf likened Bigelow to the acclaimed director and propagandist for the Nazi regime, Leni Riefenstahl, saying: [...] "Like Riefenstahl, you are a great artist. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> will be remembered forever as torture's handmaiden." [...] Author Karen J. Greenberg wrote that [...] "Bigelow has bought in, hook, line, and sinker, to the ethos of the Bush administration and its apologists" [...] and called the film [...] "the perfect piece of propaganda, with all the appeal that naked brutality, fear, and revenge can bring". Peter Maass of The Atlantic said the film [...] "represents a troubling new frontier of government-embedded filmmaking".|$|E
