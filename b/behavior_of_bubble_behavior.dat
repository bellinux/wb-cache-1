In the present study, the effect <b>of</b> vapor <b>bubble</b> on fluid flow and heat transfer in a microchannel is investigated via lattice Boltzmann (LB) modeling. With respect to boiling flow in a single microchannel, the bubble nucleation, growth, and departure are simulated by using an improved hybrid LB model. Relating <b>bubble</b> <b>behavior</b> with fluid flow and boiling heat transfer provides {{some insight into the}} relevant fundamental physics on flow boiling in the microchannel.

40|$|Most {{real life}} bubble {{dynamics}} applications involve multiple bubbles, for example, in cavitation erosion prevention, ultrasonic baths, underwater warfare, and medical applications involving microbubble contrast agents. Most scientific dealings with bubble-bubble interaction focus on two similarly sized bubbles. In this study, {{the interaction between}} two oscillating differently sized bubbles (generated in tap water) is studied using high speed photography. Four types <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> <b>behavior</b> were observed, namely, jetting toward each other, jetting away from each other, bubble coalescence, and a behavior termed the "catapult" effect. In-phase bubbles jet toward each other, while out-of-phase bubbles jet away from each other. There exists a critical phase difference that separates the two regimes. The <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bubbles</b> is fully characterized by their dimensionless separation distance, their phase difference, and their size ratio.

40|$|For the {{improvement}} of the design and operation of the FBC systems, the insight into the intrinsic transient bubbling phenomena in freely bubbling fluidized beds is of vital importance. The authors have found several basic new bubbling mechanisms in this work experimentally, and some of them have not been published in past literature. Using the two dimensional fluidized bed, the images <b>of</b> transient <b>bubbling</b> <b>behavior</b> were recorded by videos, and processed and analyzed by computers. As the results of experiments, the following new experimental facts were found: (1) transient bubbles change and fluctuate their size and shape over very short time intervals (on the order of 30 milliseconds); (2) bubble disappearance and reappearance occurred in the emulsion phase in addition to the known phenomena of coalescence and splitting. The bubble interaction occurred between the bubbles and adjacent emulsion phase and also among the transient bubbles; (3) bubble`s velocity fluctuated significantly, e. g., 0. 6 to 3. 0 m/s; (4) under one single specific fluidization condition, two different fluidization patterns appeared to occur randomly shifting from one pattern to the other or vice versa; (5) the erosion rates of in-bed tubes at ambient and elevated temperature could be predicted using material property data and transient <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles.</b> By introducing a new quantitative criterion which the authors call a gas stress index in the emulsion phase, the comparison of the fluidization quality between two and three dimensional fluidized beds was accomplished.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} which describes the <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> a vapor <b>bubble</b> in a liquid. Its physical basis {{is the assumption}} that the heat transfer effects which accompany the evaporation occurring at the bubble wall when the bubble grows, 0 r the condensation that occurs there when the bubble collapses, are dynamically important. The basic equations of hydrodynamics are shown to reduce, for the problem under consideration, to a dynamic equation which describes the <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bubble</b> wall, and a heat convection equation for the liquid which is coupled to the dynamic equation by a boundary condition at the bubble surface. A solution for the heat problem is obtained under the assumption that significant temperature variation in the liquid occurs only in a thin thermal boundary layer surrounding the bubble wall. An estimate of the correction to the temperature solution is also derived. Once the temperature at the bubble wall is given, the vapor pressure within the bubble is known and the dynamic problem becomes determinate.
