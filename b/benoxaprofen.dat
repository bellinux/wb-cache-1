500|$|Solar {{urticaria}} is an immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity {{that can}} be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization. Primary SU {{is believed to be}} a type I hypersensitivity (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis) in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is [...] "induced by UV or visible radiation." [...] Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as tar, pitch, and dyes. People who use drugs such as <b>benoxaprofen</b> or patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this photosensitivity are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light.|$|E
50|$|A {{structural}} analog of flunoxaprofen is <b>benoxaprofen.</b> The two {{drugs are}} carboxylic acid analogs that form reactive acyl glucurnonides. <b>Benoxaprofen</b> {{has been shown}} to be involved in rare hepatotoxicity. Because of this, <b>benoxaprofen</b> has been removed from the market. In response to this the clinical use of flunoxaprofen has also stopped, even though studies have shown that flunoxaprofen is less toxic than <b>benoxaprofen.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been shown that {{flunoxaprofen}} inhibits leukotriene rather than prostaglandin synthesis. This is similar to <b>benoxaprofen.</b> Flunoxaprofen and <b>benoxaprofen</b> have been shown to have similar absorption characteristics. However, the distribution and elimination of flunoxaprofen {{has been shown to be}} much faster than <b>benoxaprofen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{inversion}} of the R(-) enantiomer and glucuronide conjugation will metabolize <b>benoxaprofen.</b> However, <b>benoxaprofen</b> will not readily undergo oxidative metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>benoxaprofen</b> {{is highly}} phototoxic. The free radical decarboxylated {{derivative}} {{of the drug}} is the toxic agent which, {{in the presence of}} oxygen, yields singlet oxygen and superoxy anion.Photochemical decarboxylation via a radical mechanism and in single-strand breaks of DNA is caused by irradiation of <b>benoxaprofen</b> in an aqueous solution. This also happens to ketoprofen and naproxen, other NSAIDs, which are even more active in this respect than <b>benoxaprofen.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the {{suspension}} of sales in 1982 the toxic effects which <b>benoxaprofen</b> might have on humans were looked into more deeply. The fairly planar compound of <b>benoxaprofen</b> seems to be hepa- and phototoxic in the human body.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>Benoxaprofen</b> on animals {{were tested in}} a series of experiments. <b>Benoxaprofen</b> had a {{considerably}} anti-inflammatory, analgesic and also anti-pyretic activity in those tests. In all six animals tested, which included rats, dogs, rhesus monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice, the drug was well absorbed orally. In three of the six species <b>benoxaprofen</b> was then effectively taken up from the gastrointestinal tract (after oral doses of 1-10 mg/kg). The plasma half life was found to be different, being less than 13 hours in the dog, rabbit and monkey, it was notable longer in mice. Furthermore, there were species differences found in the rate and route of excretion of the compound. Whereas <b>benoxaprofen</b> was excreted into the urine by the rabbit and guinea pig, biliary excretion was the way of clearance found in rats and dogs. In all species only unchanged <b>benoxaprofen</b> was found in the plasma mostly extensively bound to proteins.|$|E
50|$|The Eli Lilly Company {{suspended}} {{sales of}} <b>benoxaprofen</b> that afternoon.|$|E
50|$|Cutaneous {{side effects}} of <b>benoxaprofen</b> are photosensitivity, onycholysis, rash, milia, {{increased}} nail growth, pruritus (itch) and hypertrichosis. Photosensitivity leads to burning, itching or redness when patients are exposed to sunlight.A study shows that <b>benoxaprofen,</b> or other lipoxygenase-inhibiting agents, might be helpful {{in the treatment of}} psoriasis because the migration inhibition of the inflammatory cells (leukocytes) into the skin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen</b> is a {{racemic mixture}} acid. The two enantiomers are R(-) and S(+).|$|E

50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen</b> is an analgesic, {{antipyretic}} and anti-inflammatory drug.Benoxaprofen {{was given}} to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis because of its anti-inflammatory effect. Patients with the Paget’s disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, a painful shoulder, the mixed connective-tissue disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, back pain and the Behçet’s disease received <b>benoxaprofen,</b> too. A daily dose of 300-600 mg is effective for many patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen</b> was {{discovered}} {{by a team of}} Lilly chemists at its British laboratory. This laboratory was assigned to explore new anti-arthritic compounds in 1966. Lilly applied for patents on <b>benoxaprofen</b> seven years later and also filed for permission from the FDA to start testing the drug on humans. It had to undergo the three-step clinical testing procedure required by the Federal Government.|$|E
50|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking <b>benoxaprofen</b> might result in depression, {{lethargy}} and feeling ill.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other NSAIDs, <b>benoxaprofen</b> acts {{directly}} on mononuclear cells. It inhibits their chemotactic response by inhibiting the lipoxygenase enzyme.|$|E

50|$|The {{molecular}} formula of <b>benoxaprofen</b> is C16H12ClNO3 and the systematic (IUPAC) name is 2-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-benzoxazol-5-ylpropionic acid. The molecule has a molecular mass of 301.050568 g/mol.|$|E
50|$|The {{excretion}} of the unchanged compound {{into the}} bile did occur more slowly in rats. This is {{interpreted by the}} authors as evidence that no enterohepatic circulation takes place. Another research in rats showed that the plasma membrane of hepatocytes begun to form blebs after administration of <b>benoxaprofen.</b> This is suggested {{to be due to}} disturbances in the calcium concentration which is possibly a result of an altered cellular redox state which can have an effect on mitochondrial function and therefore cause disturbances in the calcium concentration. In none of the species significant levels of metabolism of <b>benoxaprofen</b> were found to have happened. Only in dogs glucuronide could be found in the bile which is a sure sign of metabolism in that species. Also no differences in distribution of the compound in normal and pregnant rats were found. It was shown in rats that <b>benoxaprofen</b> was distributed into the foetus but with a notable lower concentration than in the maternal tissue.|$|E
50|$|Gastrointestinal {{side effects}} of <b>benoxaprofen</b> are bleeding, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} pain, anorexia (symptom), mouth ulcers and taste change. According to a study the most appearing gastric side effects are vomiting, heartburn and epigastric pain.|$|E
50|$|The fetal {{hepatotoxicity}} of <b>benoxaprofen</b> can {{be attributed}} to the accumulation of the drug after a repeated dosage and also associated with the slow plasma clearance. The hepatic accumulation of the drug is presumably the cause for an increase in the activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450I which will oxygenate benaxoprofen and produce reactive intermediates. <b>Benoxaprofen</b> is very likely a substrate and weak inducer of cytochrome P450I and its enzyme family. Normally it is not metabolized by oxidative reactions but with the S(+) enantiomer of <b>benoxaprofen</b> and cytochrome P450I as a catalyst the oxygenation of the 4-chlorophenyl ring and of the aromatic ring of 2-phenyl propionic acid seems to be possible. Therefore, the induction of a minor metabolic pathway leads to the formation of toxic metabolites in considerable amounts. The toxic metabolites may bind to vital intracellular macromolecules and may generate reactive oxygens by redox cycling if quinone is formed. This could also lead to a depletion of protective glutathione which is responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygens.|$|E
50|$|In female rats, after oral dose of 20 mg/kg, {{the tissue}} {{concentration}} of <b>benoxaprofen</b> {{was the highest}} in liver, kidney, lungs, adrenals and ovaries. The distribution in pregnant females is the same, while {{it can also be}} found -in lower concentrations- in the foetus. There is a big difference between species in the route of excretion. In man, rhesus monkey and rabbit it is mostly excreted via the urine, while in rat and dog it was excreted via biliary-faecal excretion. In man and dog, the compound was excreted as the ester glucuronide, and in the other species as the unchanged compound. This means no major metabolic transformation of <b>benoxaprofen</b> takes place.|$|E
50|$|The {{observed}} skin phototoxicity {{of patients}} treated with <b>benoxaprofen</b> {{can be explained}} {{with a look at}} the structure of the compound. There are significant structural similarities between the benzoxazole ring of <b>benoxaprofen</b> and the benzafuran ring of psoralen, a compound known to be phototoxic. The free decarboxylated derivate of the drug can produce singlet oxygen and superoxy anions in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, possible explanations for the photochemical decarboxylation and oxygen radical formation may be the accumulation of repeated dosage, the induction of cytochrome P450I and the emergence of reactive intermediates with covalent binding. The photochemical character of the compound can cause inflammation and severe tissue damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen</b> {{is absorbed}} well after oral intake of doses ranging from 1 up to 10 mg/kg. Only the {{unchanged}} drug is {{detected in the}} plasma, mostly bound to plasma proteins.6 The plasma levels of <b>benoxaprofen</b> in eleven subjects have been accurately predicted, based on the two-compartment open model. The mean half-life of absorption was 0.4 hours. This means that within 25 minutes, half of the dose is absorbed in the system. The mean half-life of distribution was 4.8 hours. This means that within 5 hours, half of the dose is distributed throughout the entire system. The mean half-life of elimination was 37.8 hours. This means that within 40 hours, half of the dose is excreted out of the system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen</b> is {{essentially}} a planar molecule. This {{is due to the}} co-planarity of the benzoxazole and phenyl rings, but the molecule also has a non-planar side chain consisting of the propanoic acid moiety which acts as a carrier group. These findings were determined with the use of X-ray crystallographic measurements by the Lilly Research Centre Limited.|$|E
50|$|A Sandmeyer {{reaction}} by diazotization of 2-(4-aminophenyl)propanenitrile (1) {{followed by}} acid hydrolysis leads to phenol (2), which undergoes nitration and reduction to give aminophenol (3). Hydrolysis of the nitrile and esterification produces ester 4, which {{is converted to}} <b>benoxaprofen</b> (5) by acylation with p-chlorobenzoyl chloride, followed by cyclization and then by saponification of the ethyl ester.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen</b> has {{a rather}} long half life in man (t1/2= 20-30 h), {{undergoes}} biliary excretion and enterohepatic circulation {{and is also}} known to have a slow plasma clearance (CL p=4.5 ml/min). The half life may be further increased in elderly patients (>80 years of age) and in patients which already have an renal impairment increasing to figures as high as 148 hours.|$|E
50|$|When <b>benoxaprofen</b> was on {{the market}} as Oraflex in the USA {{the first sign of}} trouble came for the Lilly Company. The British Medical Journal {{reported}} in May 1982 that physicians in the UK believed that the drug was responsible for at least 12 deaths, mainly caused by kidney and liver failure. A petition was filed to have Oraflex removed from the market.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen,</b> since {{withdrawn}} {{due to its}} liver toxicity, was {{the most}} photoactive NSAID observed. The mechanism of photosensitivity, responsible for the high photoactivity of the 2-arylpropionic acids, is the ready decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid moiety. The specific absorbance characteristics of the different chromophoric 2-aryl substituents, affects the decarboxylation mechanism. While ibuprofen has weak absorption, {{it has been reported}} as a weak photosensitising agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benoxaprofen,</b> {{also known}} as Benoxaphen, is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula C16H12ClNO3. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and was marketed under the brand name Oraflex in the United States and as Opren in Europe by Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly suspended sales of Oraflex in 1982 after reports from the British government and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of adverse effects and deaths linked to the drug.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the pattern of use of <b>benoxaprofen</b> (Opren) in a single group {{practice}} for a period which included the complete clinical life of the drug. One hundred and seventy-two patients of the 6495 practice patients had been prescribed <b>benoxaprofen,</b> but 55 % had only a small exposure (less than 20 g). Recorded adverse reactions, of which none was serious, appeared in 25 patients. Most were taking <b>benoxaprofen</b> for osteoarthritis (53 %) or non-specific musculoskeletal pain (39. 9 %). The issue of a prescription was not recorded in 19. 6 % of cases and 88 % were on additional drugs. Greater precision in record-keeping is required to avoid problems similar to the experience with <b>benoxaprofen...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} within-patient {{trial in}} rheumatoid arthritis comparing the new anti-inflammatory drug <b>benoxaprofen</b> with naproxen is reported. Patients received naproxen 250 mg b. d. {{for two weeks}} and <b>benoxaprofen</b> 200 mg b. d. for three weeks. Both drugs demonstrated efficacy. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between them, except for grip strength which favoured naproxen. Side-effects were mild, infrequent and similar for both drugs. Evidence is presented which confirms the long duration of action of <b>benoxaprofen,</b> a fact which may be of clinical significance. <b>BENOXAPROFEN</b> [2 -(4 -chlorophenyl) -a-methyl- 5 -benzoxazole acetic acid], LRCL 3794, is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a long plasma half-life of about 33 hours in man (Chatfield et al., 1977). It differs from many other such agents in being a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase, suggesting that other mechanisms are important for its anti-inflammatory activity (Cashin, Dawson and Kitchen, 1977; Ford-Hutchinson et al., 1977). The present trial was designed to compare the effectiveness and acceptability of <b>benoxaprofen</b> 200 mg twice daily with the established anti-inflammatory analgesic naproxen in a dosage of 250 mg twice daily...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of adverse {{dermatological}} reactions to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent <b>benoxaprofen.</b> Photosensitivity was seen in several patients, confined to wavelengths less than 340 nm. Other cutaneous side effects were erythema multiforme, the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, milia, and onycholysis. One case of pancytopenia and toxic epidermal necrolysis was reported. patients were not rechallenged with the drug, but these reactions appear to be true side effects of <b>benoxaprofen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Out of 300 {{patients}} who had taken <b>benoxaprofen</b> for a mean of 6. 4 months, 196 (65. 3 %) reported side effects, resulting in 104 patients (34. 6 %) having the drug withdrawn. Out of 42 patients aged over 70, 35 (83. 3 %) had side effects and 29 (69. 0 %) had the drug withdrawn because of them. cutaneous side effects accounted for 180 (69. 5 %) of all 259 side effects reported. The commonest cutaneous side effect was photosensitivity, which occurred in 86 patients (28. 6 %). Photosensitivity, which occurred in half of the patients treated in the summer, resulted in withdrawal of <b>benoxaprofen</b> in 26 (30. 2 %) of the {{patients who}} experienced it. Onycholysis was observed in 38 patients (12. 6 %) and was frequently unnoticed by patients. The overall incidence of gastric side effects was 12. 6 % (38 patients), and the figure rose to 40. 5 % (17 cases) in patients over 70. During treatment with <b>benoxaprofen</b> one patient developed an active duodenal ulcer but no cases of major gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred. Multiple subepidermal cysts (milia) were observed in 16 patients, who had been treated for a mean of 10. 8 months. These findings show that <b>benoxaprofen</b> is a potent phototoxic drug and that the manufacturers' recommended dosage of 600 mg daily is associated with an unacceptable incidence of side effects in the elderly...|$|E
40|$|By using 51 Cr-labelled {{erythrocytes}} and 141 Ce-labelled microspheres {{to correct}} for daily variations in faecal output, gastrointestinal microbleeding {{was measured in}} hospital patients with rheumatoid arthritis before and after administration of 2 propionic acid derivatives. These were flurbiprofen and <b>benoxaprofen,</b> respectively a potent and a weak prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. Increased faecal blood loss occurred consistently with flurbiprofen and not with <b>benoxaprofen.</b> Our results provide indirect evidence for the cytoprotective effect of prostaglandins on the gastrointestinal mucosa in man. The quantitative correlation between faecal occult blood loss {{as measured by the}} above techniques and the Haemoccult slide test is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Flunoxaprofen {{is a new}} nonsteroidal {{antiinflammatory}} agent that, like <b>benoxaprofen,</b> inhibits leukotriene {{rather than}} prostaglandin synthesis. The absorption and disposition kinetics of flunoxaprofen and <b>benoxaprofen</b> have been compared in six healthy volunteers after oral administration of 100 mg of each drug. The two drugs showed similar absorption characteristics, whereas the distribution and elimination processes were much faster for flunoxaprofen. The renal route of elimination appeared to contribute significantly less to the disposition of flunoxaprofen. These kinetic characteristics render less likely the risk of excessive drug accumulation with flunoxaprofen, especially {{in the presence of}} reduced renal function...|$|E
