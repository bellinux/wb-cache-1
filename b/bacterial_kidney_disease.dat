40|$|Kidney podocytes {{and their}} slit {{diaphragms}} form the final barrier to urinary protein loss. This explains why podocyte injury is {{typically associated with}} nephrotic syndrome. The present study uncovered an unanticipated novel role for costimulatory molecule B 7 - 1 in podocytes as an inducible modifier of glomerular permselectivity. B 7 - 1 in podocytes was found in genetic, drug-induced, immune-mediated, and <b>bacterial</b> toxin–induced experimental <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> with nephrotic syndrome. The clinical significance of our results is underscored by the observation that podocyte expression of B 7 - 1 correlated with the severity of human lupus nephritis. In vivo, exposure to low-dose LPS rapidly upregulates B 7 - 1 in podocytes of WT and SCID mice, leading to nephrotic-range proteinuria. Mice lacking B 7 - 1 are protected from LPS-induced nephrotic syndrome, suggesting a link between podocyte B 7 - 1 expression and proteinuria. LPS signaling through toll-like receptor- 4 reorganized the podocyte actin cytoskeleton in vitro, and activation of B 7 - 1 in cultured podocytes led to reorganization of vital slit diaphragm proteins. In summary, upregulation of B 7 - 1 in podocytes {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of proteinuria by disrupting the glomerular filter and provides a novel molecular target to tackle proteinuric <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases.</b> Our findings suggest a novel function for B 7 - 1 in danger signaling by nonimmune cells...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> are at {{increased}} risk for adverse health outcomes in comparison to patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Therefore, patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> may have greater use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders than patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in the setting of an acute illness. We examined the association between advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and use of DNR orders in patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to all greater Worcester, MA, hospitals as part of an epidemiological study. METHODS: Use of DNR orders in 4, 033 Worcester residents hospitalized with AMI at 11 greater Worcester medical centers during 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003 was examined. Advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> was defined on the basis of serum creatinine level at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and AMI had a DNR order in their medical records compared with 21 % of patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> After controlling for a variety of potentially confounding factors, patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> {{were more likely to have}} a DNR order than patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 55; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 21 to 1. 98).

The presence of anti-Corynebacterium precipitin or agglutinin antibodies in the salmon does not serve as a suitable indicator of current infection by the kidney disease bacterium. Coho salmon anti-Corynebacteriurn antibodies appeared to have either cleared the bacteria from the fish or at least reduced the number of kidney disease bacteria to a level not detectable by cultivation of or microscopic examination of kidney tissue. By immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, two distinct antigens were detected in ammonium sulfate-precipitated material from phosphate-buffered saline extracts of whole Corynebacterium cells. On the basis of chemical analyses, Pronase and heat treatments, both antigens appeared to contain protein and carbohydrate.

The studies completed this year have: (1) identified antigenic material which protect; (2) identified antigenic material which can exacerbate the disease; (3) identified a possibly major mechanism of pathogenesis via the interference with antibody; (4) the general ability to produce delineated a western blot technique for identification of infected fish; (5) described the use of monoclonal antibodies for antigenic analysis; and (6) identified an unusual and dramatic effect of R. salmoninarum cells on phagocytic function...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Juvenile {{coho salmon}} (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were orally immunized against the {{bacterium}} Flexibacter columnaris (formerly Chondrococcus columnaris), the causative agent of columnaris disease in fish, with a vaccine-food preparation containing formalin-killed cells. Fish immunized for 1, 2, 3, and 4 months were challenged with selected concentrations of F. columnaris by exposure in water. Protection from F. columnaris was first detected among fish immunized for 3 months and {{exposed to the}} lowest level of challenge used (- 0. 9 x 10 ⁵ cells/ml). All challenges of fish immunized for 4 months indicated that the vaccine had induced an immune response against columnaris disease. Two polyvalent vaccine studies were conducted to investigate the effect that combining of parenterally administered antigens had on immune responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). Serum aglutinin titers were measured for indication of immune responses. In one study, formalin-killed cells of F. columnaris, Aeromonas salmonicida, and the causative agent (bacterium) of redmouth disease were mixed in all possible combinations and administered to different groups of fish. Responses of fish to antigens administered in the trivalent vaccine and the three divalent vaccines were monitored monthly for 3 months and compared with responses of fish injected with the corresponding monovalent vaccines. Comparisons indicated that responses to the combined antigens were not affected by either F. columnaris or the causative agent of redmouth disease. However, interference from A. salmonicida antigen suppressed responses to F. columnaris and the causative agent of redmouth disease. In the second study, formalin-killed cells of A. salmonicida, A. hydrophila, two strains of F. columnaris, and the causative agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> were combined and injected into rainbow trout brookstock at the Oregon Wildlife Commission's Leaburg Trout Hatchery. Serum agglutinin titers of samples taken before vaccination and 3 and 12 months after vaccination were measured for each entigen. Excellent responses to A. salmonicida antigen and slight responses to the causative agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> occurred. The fish did not respond to antigens of either strain of F. columnaris or A. hydrophila...|$|E
40|$|Chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{progressive}} destruction of kidney structure and continuously. The {{problem is the}} frequent occurrence of generalized weakness and edema tended to occur. Handling and treatment need hemodialysis and strict treatment and also family support. This study aimed {{to find out how}} the treatment in patients with chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> using a family approach. This qualitative research with case study research approach used subject of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> for 7 years with Â± 2604 times hemodialysis. The data was taken with the interview, observation, documentation, and data analysis. The results of this study showed three themes, 1) Treatment of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> with hemodialysis, 2) Treatment of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> at home, 3) Client motivation with chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Treatment of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> with hemodialysis must be done by patients to improve their quality of their life. In addition, treatment of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> at home is believed to maintain the stability condition of the patient. High motivation to patients is believed {{to improve the quality of}} their life...|$|R

40|$|Identifying genes {{underlying}} common {{forms of}} <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in humans has proven difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for several complex traits are concordant among mice, rats, and humans, suggesting that genetic findings from these animal models {{are relevant to}} human disease. Therefore, we reviewed the literature on genetic studies of <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in rat and mouse and examined the concordance between <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> QTL across species. Fifteen genomic regions contribute to <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in the rat, with 12 replicated either in a separate rat cross or in another species. Five loci found in humans were concordant to QTL found in the rat. Two of these were found by homology to a previously identified rat QTL on chromosome 1, demonstrating that <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> loci in animal models can predict the location of <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> loci in humans. In contrast to the rat, the mouse has been underutilized in the genetic analysis of polygenic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> although mutagenesis and QTL analysis in the mouse are likely to contribute new findings in the near future. Knowledge of <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> loci conserved between the mouse and rat will identify prime candidate loci to test for association with chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in humans...|$|R
