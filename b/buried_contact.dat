40|$|Fabrication and {{characterisation}} of <b>buried</b> metal <b>contacts</b> in {{compound semiconductors}} are demonstrated. The contacts {{have been investigated}} due to their usage both as gates in transistors and as active or passive elements in novel devices. A {{detailed description of the}} processing conditions for fabrication of nm-sized W-structures in a lift-off process is given. These structures have been embedded in GaAs or InP by epitaxial overgrowth using metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. The conditions for epitaxial overgrowth are discussed and a special emphasis is given the correlation between processing and electrical characteristics of the <b>buried</b> <b>contacts.</b> Matrices of W discs have been buried in GaAs and a controlled formation of semi-insulating material is demonstrated in structures with varying disc separation. The kinetics of the <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> have been investigated by photo-conductivity measurements, photo-capacitance transients and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The capture and emission have been studied on a signal level of one electron per disc. Thereby, the Coulomb effect on the contacts are revealed. The semi-insulating properties is used for fabrication of vertical channels in vacant postitions in a buried disc lattice. GaInP/GaAs double barriers are combined with the buried metal discs and sub-micrometer resonant tunnelling diodes are created. Three-terminal devices are further discussed. The characteristics of a Heterojunction Permeable Base Transistor has been simulated and the ballistic transport is shown to substantially enhance the device performance. Interference of electron waves is numerically demonstrated to create an interference pattern in the Solid State Biprism Device. Finally, lateral confinement effects are observed in a resonant tunnelling transistor. All these devices rely on the fabrication of three-dimensional metal-semiconductor heterostructures...|$|R

40|$|Positrons from a {{radioactive}} source are implanted into a reverse-biased metal-semiconductor contact and are drifted {{back towards the}} contact by the internal electric field where they trap into voids and annihilate. The electric field dependent interface annihilation fraction is monitored {{by way of the}} intensity of the long (∼ 400 - 500 ps) void lifetime component using positron-lifetime spectroscopy. Unlike previous analyses of such systems a numerical model involving positron drift, annihilation and trapping into the interfacial state has been constructed to describe the positron dynamics {{in the presence of the}} non-uniform junction electric field. The use of the positron-lifetime technique in probing the internal electric field at <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> is thus demonstrated.

40|$|Buried water {{molecules}} (having {{no contact with}} bulk solvent) in 30 helical transmembrane (TM) protein structures were identified. The average amount of buried water in helical TM proteins {{is about the same}} as for all water-soluble (WS) proteins, but it is greater than the average for helical WS proteins. Buried waters in TM proteins make more polar contacts, and are more frequently found contacting helices than in WS proteins. The distribution of the buried water binding sites across the membrane profile shows that the sites to some extent reflect protein function. There is also evidence for asymmetry of the sites, with more in the extracellular half of the membrane. Many of the <b>buried</b> water <b>contact</b> sites are conserved across families of proteins, including family members having different functions. This suggests that at least some buried waters play a role in structural stabilization. Disease-causing mutations, which are known to result in misfolded TM proteins, occur at <b>buried</b> water <b>contact</b> sites at a higher than random frequency, which also supports a stabilizing role for buried {{water molecules}}...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{processing}} is {{an important}} application for fabrication of silicon solar cells, e. g. <b>buried</b> <b>contacts,</b> laser fired contacts or edge isolation. At Fraunhofer ISE a liquid-jet guided laser is used for Laser Chemical Processing (LCP). Both the fundamentals of laser material ablation with this system {{and the application of}} various processes for solar cell fabrication are investigated. The applications are divided into two main areas: Microstructuring and deep laser cutting (wafering) of silicon substrates. Microstructuring contains the investigation and characterization of laser induced damage and selective emitter formation for n- and p-type emitters depending on laser parameters and liquid properties. One of the most important and industrially relevant topics at the moment is the formation of a selective highly doped emitter under the metal fingers of solar cells. Wafering deals with the evaluation of suitable laser parameters, adequate chemicals or chemical additives and the understanding of ablation processes by simulation and experimental work. In this presentation newest results concerning n-type doping for varying laser and liquid parameters will be presented with regard to cell efficiency and contact resistance. Furthermore a short overview of promising LCP applications will be given, e. g. p-type doping and wafering...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D Si integration seems a {{right way}} to go and compete with Moore’s law (more than Moore versus more Moore). However, it {{is still a long way}} to go. In 2010, the question was: Why 3 D? Today, the questions are: When 3 D? and How 3 D? The 3 D chip stacking is considered known to overcome conventional 2 D-IC issues, using in-depth contacts or some trough silicon via for signal transmission. First of all, from any source, we calculate the staggered impedance. For this, our approach is, at least, twofold: a compact Green kernel, or Transmission Line Model, over or into a multi-layered substrate, is derived by solving Poisson's equation analytically. The Discrete Cosine Transform and its variations are used for rapid evaluation. Using this technique, the substrate coupling and loss in IC's can be analyzed. We implement our algorithm in MATLAB. Thus, it permits to extract impedances between any two embedded contacts, real or virtual; this is original, up to our knowledge [...] We investigate our models on both analytical and numerical methods, like finite elements-based simulations. This extended model enables one to extract substrate impedance and parasitic elements between any two points embedded into the substrate. They are fully compatible with SPICE-like solvers and should allow an investigation in depth of the impact of <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> on circuit performance. This work should be an opening for an in depth study on the Transfer Impedance Method concept applied to tridimensional calculations of noise...|$|R
40|$|The roadcut on highway 412 near Pedro, Benton County, Arkansas (MArkUP site L 15), {{has been}} of {{geological}} interest since its excavation in the 1980 s. The roadcut is located within the Springfield Plateau and displays formations of Lower Mississippian age. The roadcut contains three mound-like features believed to be olistoliths. This thesis research work adds geophysical evidence to the geological exposure at the site. The purpose {{of this research is}} to answer the question of whether near surface seismic methods can be used to extend information at the Pedro outcrop below the ground surface. Specifically, can the top of the Middle Ordovician Everton contact be identified? Seismic experiments were conducted by the University of Arkansas MArkUP team, investigating parts of the Middle Ordovician through Lower Mississippian succession, using a 48 -channel Geode seismograph, sledge hammer source, and seismic acquisition software. Interpretation of P-wave refraction events estimate that the top of the Middle Ordovician Everton occurs 69 feet below the natural ground surface {{from the top of the}} Pedro outcrop at the location of the largest mound, or approximately 31 feet below the surface of the base of the roadcut. Estimation of the Chattanooga-Everton contact involved data acquisition, processing to reduce noise, first arrival event picking and manual inversion to estimate layer depths and velocities. Ray Trace modeling confirmed inversion results and local stratigraphy was found to be consistent. The value of this study demonstrates that shallow seismic data can estimate <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> below outcrops and extend geological knowledge in northwest Arkansas...|$|R

Surface metrology {{plays an important role in}} the development and manufacture of photovoltaic cells and modules. Coherence Correlation Interferometry (CCI) is a non-contacting surface metrology tool with potentially important applications in the characterization of photovoltaic devices. Its major advantages are that it is fast, non-destructive and it takes its data from a relatively large and hence representative area. A special mode, called “stitching x-y” can be used to provide information on a wider area, combining measurements taken in different zones of the sample. The technique is capable of providing surface roughness and step height measurements with sub-nanometre precision. It is also capable of measuring quantitatively surface texture and surface form in three dimensions and it now has a new capability to measure thin film and thick film thickness. CCI measurements are presented on a range of features on silicon photovoltaic cells including surface roughness, surface texture, the profile of laser grooves for <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> as well as the roughness and thickness of silicon nitride thin films. Complementary analysis using spectroscopic ellipsometry is also presented for verification. CCI is a sensitive, non-destructive metrology technique with potential use as an in-line quality assurance tool in the large scale production of photovoltaic modules...|$|R

50|$|Four {{discrete}} {{regions of}} CyaA bind calcium-loaded calmodulin {{with a large}} <b>buried</b> <b>contact</b> surface. Of those, a tryptophan residue (W242) at an alpha-helix of CyaA makes extensive contacts with the calcium-induced, hydrophobic pocket of calmodulin. Mutagenic analyses show that all four regions of CyaA contribute to calmodulin binding and the calmodulin-induced conformational change of CyaA is crucial for catalytic activation. A crystal structure of CyaA-calmodulin with adefovir diphosphate, the metabolite of an approved antiviral drug, reveals the location of catalytic site of CyaA and how adefovir diphosphate tightly binds CyaA. The ACD of CyaA shares a similar structure and mechanism of activation with anthrax edema factor (EF). However, the interactions of CyaA with calmodulin completely diverge from those of EF. This provides molecular details of how two structurally homologous bacterial toxins evolved divergently to bind calmodulin, an evolutionarily conserved calcium sensor.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The high {{efficiency}} solar cells, like <b>buried</b> <b>contact</b> solar cells, often require a dense silicon nitride as a diffusion barrier and anti reflection coating. This is normally realized by Low Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (LPCVD) using dichloro silane based nitride deposited at {{temperatures in the}} range of 700 °C- 800 °C. In this work we present bifacial solar cells with front side <b>buried</b> <b>contact</b> and rear side screen printed, realized using a lower temperature LPCVD process based on bis-(tertiary butyl amino) -silane (BTBAS) precursor. The temperature used for the nitride deposition is {{in the range of}} 550 °C to 600 °C. The solar cells produced show fill factors over 77. 6 % on the front side and 76. 8 % on the rear side. This higher fill factor values indicates that this hybrid contact structure works well for the bifacial solar cell structure. In addition the cell structure has better mechanical strength as compared to double side <b>buried</b> <b>contact</b> solar cell...|$|E

Electrical characterization and thermal imaging indicate {{a lack of}} interconnect failures and low overall fill-factor losses. Junction recombination losses are suggested by higher than average diode ideality factors; however, the role of Cu contamination could not be confirmed. Nonetheless, module power degradation rates are observed {{to be similar to}} that of screen-printed modules of similar vintage, suggesting {{that it is possible to}} make Ni/Cu contacts that are as durable as screen-printed contacts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{structures}} are comprised of modular elements known as domains. These units are used and re-used {{over and over}} in nature, and usually serve some particular function in the structure. Thus it is useful to be able to break up a protein of interest into its component domains, prior to similarity searching for example. Numerous computational methods exist for doing so, but most operate only on a single protein chain and many are limited to making a series of cuts to the sequence, while domains can and do span multiple chains. Results This study presents a novel clustering-based approach to domain identification, which works equally well on individual chains or entire complexes. The method is simple and fast, taking only a few milliseconds to run, and works by clustering either vectors representing secondary structure elements, or buried alpha-carbon positions, using average-linkage clustering. Each resulting cluster corresponds to a domain of the structure. The method is competitive with others, achieving 70 % agreement with SCOP on a large non-redundant data set, and 80 % on a set more heavily weighted in multi-domain proteins on which both SCOP and CATH agree. Conclusions It is encouraging that a basic method such as this performs nearly as well or better than some far more complex approaches. This suggests that protein domains are indeed for the most part simply compact regions of structure with a higher density of <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> within themselves than between each other. By representing the structure as a set of points or vectors in space, it allows us to break free of any artificial limitations that other approaches may depend upon. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nine shallow (c 70 ft), closely spaced core holes were {{continuously}} cored in {{the upper}} units of the 1. 22 Ma Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff at Technical Area (TA) - 3 of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The goal of the investigation was to identify faults that may have potential for earthquake-induced surface rupture {{at the site of}} the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building, a sensitive Laboratory facility that houses nuclear materials research functions. The holes were located from 25 ft to 115 ft from the building perimeter. Careful mapping of Lithologic sequences in cores, supplemented with focused sampling for geochemical analyses, yielded high confidence in the accuracy of delineating <b>buried</b> <b>contacts</b> within the Tshirege Member. Geologic analysis and investigation of the trends of surfaces interpolated from contacts in the core holes using commercially available software helped infer minor faulting in the strata beneath the building. Results show that gently north-northeast-dipping beds underlie the CMR building. The tilted beds are faulted by two small, closely spaced, parallel reverse faults with a combined vertical separation of approximately 8 ft. The faults are inferred from lithologically and geochemically repeated sections of core at about 55 -ft depth in hole SHB-CMR- 6. The data from nearby core holes SHB-CMR- 2 and SHB-CMR- 3 permit the extension of the faults, albeit with decreasing separation, toward the southwest beneath the CMR building. The fault trend is consistent with mapped lineaments from aerial photography and with nearby mapped structure, but direct evidence of the faults' orientations is lacking. No other faults were detected beneath the CMR building by this drilling and analysis method, which can detect faults with greater than about 2 ft separation...|$|R
