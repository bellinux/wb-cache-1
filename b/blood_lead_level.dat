40|$|Objectives. We {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> (>/= 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood), risk factors, and previous <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> testing among children in 2 high-risk Chicago, Ill, communities. Methods. Through high-intensity targeted screening, <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were tested and risks were assessed among {{a representative sample of}} children aged 1 to 5 years who were at risk for lead exposure. Results. Of the 539 children who were tested, 27 % had elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels,</b> and 61 % had never been tested previously. Elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with chipped exterior house paint. Conclusions. Most children who lived in these communities [...] where the prevalence for elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> among children was 12 times higher than the national prevalence [...] were not tested for lead poisoning.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and identify related risk factors among preschool {{children in a}} lead polluted area (Taizhou, China) and provide theoretical support for prevention of lead pollution. Methods. A stratified-clustered-random sampling method was used to {{determine the}} survey sample. <b>Blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were determined by the tungsten atomizer absorption spectrophotometer. Results. A total of 2, 018 subjects (average age of 59 months; 1, 087 boys and 931 girls) were included. The arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and median <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of the preschool children were 56. 4 [*]μg/L, 48. 9 [*]μg/L, and 46 [*]μg/L. A total of 8. 8 % children had <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> > 100 [*]μg/L and 43. 9 % had <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> > 50 [*]μg/L. Mother’s education level, father’s occupation, decorative tableware, exposure to makeup, and the residential floor were all risk factors for elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> (odds ratios of 1. 42, 1. 21, 1. 11, 1. 19, and 1. 27, resp.), while hand washing before eating food was a protective factor (odds ratio of 0. 88). Conclusions. The <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of preschool children in Taizhou were higher than in other areas in China and in developed countries.

5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> {{can lead}} to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and blood lead levels in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Because {{game animals}} can be shot using lead bullets, the {{potential}} for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent {{study conducted by the}} CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure.

5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>level.</b> Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E

5|$|High <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> {{in adults}} are also {{associated}} with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. It {{was found in a}} large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in the range of 20–50μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects. Increases in <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> from about 50 to about 100μg/dL in adults {{have been found to be}} associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.|$|R
500|$|In adults, {{symptoms}} {{can occur}} at levels above 40μg/dL, but {{are more likely}} to occur only above 50–60μg/dL. Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60μg/dL. However, the <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. At <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> between 25 and 60μg/dL, neuropsychiatric effects such as delayed reaction times, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed motor nerve conduction and headache can occur. Anemia may appear at <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> higher than 50μg/dL. In adults, abdominal colic, involving paroxysms of pain, may appear at <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> greater than 80μg/dL. Signs that occur in adults at <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> exceeding 100μg/dL include wrist drop and foot drop, [...] and signs of encephalopathy (a condition characterized by brain swelling), such as those that accompany increased pressure within the skull, delirium, coma, seizures, and headache. In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> exceeding 70μg/dL. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> exceed 100μg/dL.|$|R
5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>level.</b> The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
25|$|First European {{countries}} started replacing lead {{by the end}} of the 1980s and {{by the end of}} the 1990s {{leaded gasoline}} was banned within the entire European Union. Reduction in the average <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the United States and South Africa. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: taking into account a 22-year time lag, the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve.|$|E
