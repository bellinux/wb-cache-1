An electrode array includes a number of electrodes which are arranged in pair, with the electrodes in each pair being spaced a particular distance apart. The array is driven by a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> <b>system</b> which is electromagnetically coupled to each pair of electrodes and which is shielded by a ground coaxial shield which itself is ground {{to the body of}} the patient. Each electrode is embedded in a Teflon stand-off in order to move the region of strong field, from the body, produced by rapidly changing potentials. The two pairs of electrodes forming a cross-like geometry are used with the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> <b>systems.</b> The electrical power is either multiplexed among the electrodes or the second pair is driven by a potential which is sinusoidal and which is 90 % out of phase with the first <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> <b>system</b> which is also sinusoidal...|$|R

Traditional methods to eliminate hum often seem more like voo-doo than engineering and, more often than not, are trial and error exercises that end only when someone says "I can live with that". This author has previously written about <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> in audio <b>systems,</b> so this paper will be strictly confined to unbalanced systems. [2] In contrast to a balanced system, an unbalanced system uses only two wires, one for signal and one for ground. Its use still prevails in consumer audio, probably because it is cheap to make and it performs acceptably well in very small systems such as typical home stereo setups. However, any unbalanced scheme has an inherent problem called common impedance coupling. From Ohm's la...|$|R

In 2010 CGV added to its product line two HD Digital Sat receivers Set-top box, (Premio Sat HD-W TNTSAT) and (E-Sat HD-W FRANSAT) with recording of Satellite television channels on an external USB hard drive, and Powerline communication systems named (CPLine 2B), (CPline WiFi) and (CPLine AV-HD).|$|R
50|$|A {{balanced}} circuit is circuitry {{for use with}} a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> itself. <b>Balanced</b> <b>lines</b> are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two points on two wires. In a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> the two signal lines are of a matched impedance to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced.|$|R

40|$|The <b>balancing</b> of {{assembly}} <b>lines</b> {{is one of}} the most studied industrial problems, both in academic and practical fields. The workable application of the solutions passes through a reliable simplification of the real-world assembly <b>line</b> <b>systems.</b> Time and space assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> problems consider a realistic versions of the assembly lines, involving the optimization of the entire line cycle time, the number of stations to install, and the area of these stations. Components, necessary to complete the assembly tasks, have different picking times depending on the area where they are allocated. The implementation in the real world of a <b>line</b> <b>balanced</b> disregarding the distribution of the tasks which use unwieldy components can result unfeasible. The aim of this paper is to present a method which <b>balances</b> the <b>line</b> in terms of time and space, hence optimizes the allocation of the components using an evolutionary approach. In particular, a method which combines the bin packing problem with a genetic algorithm and a genetic programming is presented.

The Assembly <b>Line</b> <b>Balancing</b> Problem design problem is an artifact of that work. Theory of Constraints purports that an assembly line that is purposely and strategically unbalanced provides superior performance in terms of predictability and throughput over the traditional <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> This study articulates a custom production line model based on Theory of Constraints and compares its performance to the traditional operations management paradigm, a <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> Results show that a purposely unbalanced line provides superior flow of material and greater throughput than the traditional <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> configuration.

40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a stuffing box pressure equalization <b>line</b> (<b>balance</b> <b>line)</b> to lower stuffing box pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump. While this was an acceptable compromise in the 1950 s, {{it is now a}} true waste of very expensive electrical power. The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump.

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and professional audio, a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or <b>balanced</b> signal pair is a transmission line {{consisting of two}} conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. The chief advantage of the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a differential amplifier. Common forms of <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> are twin-lead, used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair, used for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to unbalanced lines, such as coaxial cable, {{which is designed to}} have its return conductor connected to ground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground.

5000|$|Most {{explanations}} of <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> assume symmetric (antiphase) signals {{but this is}} an unfortunate confusion—signal symmetry and <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> are quite independent of each other. Essential in a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> is matched impedances in the driver, line and receiver. These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the differential line equally and thus appears as a common mode signal that is removed by the receiver. There are balanced drive circuits that have excellent common-mode impedance matching between [...] "legs" [...] but do not provide symmetric signals. [...] Symmetric differential signals exist to prevent interference to other circuits - the electromagnetic fields are canceled out by the equal and opposite currents. But they are not necessary for interference rejection from other circuits.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} results {{related to}} the optimal design of unpaced production lines. It has been shown previously that unbalancing an unpaced production line in an appropriate way will increase its production rate. Results are presented here which show how the optimal allocation of work between stations changes with respect to [...] the number of work stations in the line, [...] the limit {{on the amount of}} work-in-progress, and [...] the variance of station operation times. [...] An analysis of results given here demonstrate the following system characteristics. When the number of stations in the production line increases, the average amount of unbalance in the optimal allocation remains about the same, but the increase in mean production rate obtained by using the optimal allocation rather than the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> becomes substantially larger. If the operation times are highly variable (exponential distribution), the effect of increasing in-process storage space is to substantially decrease the average amount of unbalance in the optimal allocation but to only slightly decrease the resulting improvement over the <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> If the amount of in-process storage space is very small, the effect of decreasing the variability of operation times is to decrease these same quantities but at a surprisingly slow rate. On the other hand, the effect of simultaneously increasing in-process storage space and decreasing the variability of operation times is to very rapidly decrease both the optimal unbalance and the resulting improvement.
