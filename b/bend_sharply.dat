5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines <b>bend</b> <b>sharply,</b> indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

50|$|Needle roller {{bearings}} use {{very long and}} thin cylinders. Often {{the ends of the}} rollers taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, or they may be hemispherical and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|E

White Swan had lost {{the lower half of}} his right hand, and he had a right wrist that was permanently deformed to <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> inward. (See photo above taken from the right side, showing injured wrist). He also limped from the bullet wound in his leg and/or foot. [...] He was deaf and dumb, reportedly from the stroke to his forehead by a warclub in a battle with a Sioux warrior, probably at a time different than the Little Bighorn Battle.|$|E
50|$|All {{parts of}} a bearing are subject to many design constraints. For example, {{the inner and outer}} races are often complex shapes, making them {{difficult}} to manufacture. Balls and rollers, though simpler in shape, are small; since they <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> where they run on the races, the bearings are prone to fatigue. The loads within a bearing assembly are also affected by the speed of operation: rolling-element bearings may spin over 100,000 rpm, and the principal load in such a bearing may be momentum rather than the applied load. Smaller rolling elements are lighter and thus have less momentum, but smaller elements also bend more sharply where they contact the race, causing them to fail more rapidly from fatigue. Maximum rolling-element bearing speeds are often specified in 'nDm', which is the product of the mean diameter (in mm) and the maximum RPM. For angular contact bearings nDms over 2.1 million {{have been found to be}} reliable in high performance rocketry applications.|$|E

5000|$|Derived bird {{traits in}} the {{skeleton}} of Sinornis are typically flight or perching adaptations. At a time when very few intermediary forms were known, the fossil seemed to provide an early glimpse of flight evolution, showing the intermediate evolutionary step between the [...] "primitive" [...] wings of Archaeopteryx to specialized wings of modern birds. As in modern birds, Sinornis had a modified wrist bone, with a groove that lets the wrist <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> back, tightly tucking the wings during flight or rest. Sinornis was capable of flight similar to modern birds based on breastbone and shoulder structures that provided both room and support for bulky aerobic flight muscles. It also had reduced claws and small hands with a stable second finger that anchored important flight feathers. Unlike the fused finger bones of modern birds, Sinornis had separate finger bones that were well adapted for flight, while {{the reduction of the}} tail moved the centre of gravity forwards. [...] Sinornis was also capable of perching and climbing.|$|E

5000|$|Even {{without using}} graph theory, {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to show that the Five Room Puzzle has no solution. First, the rules must be clarified. The rooms and the solution line must all be drawn on a single side of a normal flat sheet of paper. The solution line must be continuous, but can <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> or smoothly in any way and can even cross over itself (but not at a wall, so this is often prohibited).

30|$|In {{order to}} solve the above problem, a new {{heterojunction}} TFET with a T-shaped gate (HTG-TFET) is proposed. The proposed device structure remains vertical tunneling and places two source regions {{on both sides of}} the gate to further increase tunneling area. The T-shaped gate overlaps with the pocket regions in the lateral direction to increase the electric field at the top of tunneling junction. In addition, the heterojunctions between SiGe pocket regions and silicon source regions promote energy band to <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> [15].

40|$|Introduction: Cells {{are exposed}} {{to a wide variety}} of forces within the human body, and the {{mechanisms}} by which cells respond to these forces are largely unknown. From altering gene transcription in the cell nucleus to conformational changes in membrane channel proteins that lead to increased or decreased ion permeability, external stresses imposed on the cell can significantly affect cellular actions through a process known as "mechanotransduction. " While such cellular actions include fundamental processes such as cell motility and protein production, the cellular response to external forces can also be pathogenic. For instance, plaque formation within the arteries often occurs at points where the arteries branch or <b>bend</b> <b>sharply,</b> or rather, where cells are subjected to low or reversing fluid shear stresses. by Jeffrey J.

40|$|AbstractElectron {{microscopy}} of mammalian {{smooth muscle}} myosin rods {{showed them to}} be 153 ± 7 nm (SD) long, and to <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> (> 90 °) but infrequently, and pH independently (range 6. 5 – 9. 5), at a single site 45 ± 4 nm {{from one end of}} the molecule. Light meromyosin (LMM) preparations were 99 ± 10 nm long, and showed no bends. Intrinsic viscosity vs temperature plots for rods and LMM indicated that neither fragment changed in flexibility in the range 4 – 40 ° C. Peptide mapping in the presence and absence of SDS established that the proteolytic susceptibility of the hinge at the N terminus of LMM reflects the presence of locally different structure, and not simply a clustering of susceptible residues. The isolated smooth muscle myosin rod thus contains only a single hinge, having significant stiffness, and lacks the second bend seen under certain conditions in the intact molecule...|$|E
40|$|The spinal {{accessory}} nerve rootlets {{emerge from the}} lateral aspect of the upper five segments of the cervical spinal cord underlying the nerve trunk. They cross the lateral funiculus of the cord with a slight rostral inclination. Here some pursue a relatively straight course while others have a dorsal convexity. The transitional zones may be classified into three distinct types, related to their orientation as they traverse the glia limitans to emerge as free rootlets. The fibres in Type 1 rootlets <b>bend</b> <b>sharply</b> rostrally on reaching the glia limitans. Type 2 rootlets turn ventrally {{to run in the}} glia limitans in the transverse plane of the cord before emerging. Type 3 rootlets are found only at C 1. Their fibres initially turn caudally in the glia limitans and then loop rostrally. The morphology of the central-peripheral transitional zones of the spinal accessory rootlets closely resembles that of cervical ventral rootlets, and is therefore correlated with the motor function of these rootlets rather than with their intermediate location between the ventral and dorsal cervical rootlets...|$|E
