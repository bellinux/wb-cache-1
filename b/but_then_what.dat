So {{you can use the}} same source material in different contexts. If you're in a different place at a different time and in a different frame of mind you can use stuff that originally didn't go anywhere, and make something of it. So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. We feel like a lot of things are interesting for 30 seconds or so, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what?</b> We could probably sell riffs to rock bands, sell hundreds of riffs or piano themes or whatever, but our main problem is to tie elements together—to 'bring it home,' as they say. We are quite selective." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § 17. [...] "Well, <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> becomes of {{all these}} long dogmatic {{chapters}} of yours about giving nothing but the truth, and as much truth as possible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{believe you}} are right; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what's</b> to be done? I can hardly afford to lose this chance; but Sam was always backward; and I doubt his even caring to go to sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|GARDINER. Knave, {{thou shalt}} lose thine ears and find thy tongue, And shalt be thankful if I leave thee that. [...] [Coming before the Conduit. The conduit painted--the nine worthies--ay! <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>what's</b> here? King Harry with a scroll. Ha--Verbum Dei--verbum--word of God! God's passion! {{do you know}} the knave that painted it? ...|$|R
50|$|Taharr is {{when one}} has {{doubt as to}} whether they added or {{subtracted}} from their prayer, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> realise <b>what</b> they did wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he {{had once}} said the word to me, he should not change. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> right have I to expect it? What has he ever said about me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Burton's project, might, after all, be feasible; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> if {{her husband}} {{should really be}} angry with her? That was a misfortune which never yet had come upon her.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] said Considine, with {{a sudden}} burst of candour, [...] "I believe you are right, and I plead guilty; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> can we do? We are not clergymen." ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Ah; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> it's not <b>what</b> I want, {{but what}} Grace wants, that will weigh with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know I am, and I'm rough. I don't deny that. I'm forty, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> I'm <b>what</b> {{they call}} well preserved," [...] he smiled, winningly, [...] "and I'll soon have {{an income of}} wan hundred {{thousand}} dollars a year." ...|$|R
6000|$|DORA (pensive for once). I {{suppose it}} is very dreadful to be old! <b>But</b> <b>then</b> (brightening again), <b>what</b> should we do without our dear old friends, and our nice old lecturers? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? What {{is such a}} one likely to do? <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> do I do, as it is? It {{is the sort of}} life you would like,--if you were a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Macassar {{looked at}} his watch. He had only forty-five minutes left for everything. The expense of a cab would, to be sure, be nothing if he were successful; <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> chance was there of that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{must be very}} delicious,' said Argemone, thoughtfully, 'for any one who {{believes}} it, to think that marriage can last through eternity. <b>But,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> becomes of entire love to God? How can we part our hearts {{between him and his}} creatures?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> we had <b>what</b> {{was better}} than a {{thousand}} stories! And {{this is only a}} feeble attempt to keep up a little watery reflection of the old sunshine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] asked Dorothy, {{standing}} on tip-toes {{to look over}} his shoulder. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> she saw <b>what</b> it was and cried [...] "Oh!" [...] {{in a tone of}} astonishment.|$|R
5000|$|... “We’re {{not talking}} about someone who broke another person’s sunglasses; these are life-altering decisions. There is a beginning, middle and end to each story. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> there’s <b>what</b> happens after the {{paternity}} test results. We don’t take any of this lightly. There is a responsible side to the show where we help families get on the right path.” ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. [sitting down genteelly] I {{dont know}} what youll say to me: you know I {{really have no}} right to come here; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> was I to do? You know Holy Joe, Bobby's tutor, dont you? But of course you do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{opposing}} {{interests are}} indeed a little perplexing," [...] said Jack, after some conversation had {{passed on the}} subject.--"No doubt, Mak, you and Mbango with his friends might reach the coast safely enough without us; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> should we do without an interpreter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Charley {{was silent}} for a few seconds; then heaving a deep sigh, he said,--"Well, I believe you're right, Kate; <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> am I to do? If I don't run away, I must live, like poor Harry Somerville, on a long--legged stool; and if I do that, I'll--I'll--" ...|$|E
5000|$|The foreshadowing may be {{distinguished}} between, [...] "advance notice": for example, [...] "'Had I <b>but</b> known <b>then</b> <b>what</b> I know now, I {{would never have}} set foot on Baron von Rotschnitzel's private yacht.'"

6000|$|Once {{started with}} {{protection}} assured {{for the girl}} and a real objective point in view, Gale relaxed from the tense strain he had been laboring under. How glad {{he would have been}} to acquaint Thorne with their good fortune! Later, of course, there would be some way to get word to the cavalryman. <b>But</b> till <b>then</b> <b>what</b> torments his friend would suffer! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't, <b>then.</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> {{are you in}} such a {{hurry to}} have mother know for? She's not going to object. And if she does--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha?" [...] said Lionel, [...] "you don't {{mean that}} she has thought better of it, {{and is going to}} send Julian the Apostate to the right about. Eh? You don't say so. Well, then there is some good in Caroline after all! <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> should she want of Walter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} finds society a bore," [...] said Lord Eugene de Vere; [...] "I am sure I do; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> {{is a fellow}} to do? I am not in Parliament like Egremont. I believe, after all, that's the thing; for I have tried {{everything}} else and everything else is a bore." ...|$|E
6000|$|The channel between--the sole inlet to the bay--seems but a biscuit's toss over; you see naught of the land-locked sea within till fairly in the strait. <b>But,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>what</b> a sight is beheld!

5000|$|In {{his early}} work Franchetti experimented with late Romantic and neoclassical styles, <b>but</b> he <b>then</b> {{developed}} <b>what</b> Imanuel Willheim called [...] "a non-serial, 12-note compositional language featuring primarily diatonic motivic material".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lance!' said Mr. Audley rather severely; <b>but</b> just <b>then,</b> seeing <b>what</b> {{book the}} child was holding tight under his arm, he decided to follow {{him out of the}} room and interrogate.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>what,</b> <b>then,</b> must we {{understand}} by these lavers, {{and by this}} sacrifice being washed in them, in order to its being burned upon the altar? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> a hero was Bagwax! What self-abnegation was there! Should he be less {{ready to}} devote {{himself to his}} client,--he, who was paid for his work,--than this post-office clerk, who was as pure in his honesty as he was zealous in the cause? 'There are {{a great many of}} them, I suppose?' he said, almost whining.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> {{a welcome}} upstairs! what a clamour of happy tongues! what an ecstatic humming of 'The Hardy Norseman!' what a {{clinging}} to and climbing on him! If {{he had the}} cares, he had much of the joys, of the goodman of the house! But presently he missed the voice usually blithest of all, and asked for Lance.|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{there are many}} people who have {{declared}} the Comédie Humaine to be indigestible. Perhaps it is: <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>what</b> about truffles? Balzac’s publisher refused to be disturbed by any such criticism as that. ‘Indigestible, is it?’ he exclaimed with what, for a publisher, was rare good sense. ‘Well, I should hope so; who ever thinks of a dinner that isn’t?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 22. <b>But</b> <b>what,</b> <b>then,</b> {{has given}} rise to all those coiled plungings of the crest hither and thither, yet with such strange unity of motion? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} advise it," [...] replied Thorward; [...] "nevertheless, {{if it came}} to the worst I would do it. <b>But</b> <b>what,</b> <b>then,</b> is your advice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A low blackguard of a {{discounting}} Jew Christian. He {{would do}} it; <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> heaven knows <b>what</b> he would charge, and he'd make so many difficulties that I shouldn't {{have the money}} for the next fortnight.' ...|$|R
