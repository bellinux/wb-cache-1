25|$|A company {{planning}} an IPO typically appoints a lead manager, {{known as a}} <b>bookrunner,</b> to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the shares should be issued. There are two primary {{ways in which the}} price of an IPO can be determined. Either the company, with the help of its lead managers, fixes a price ("fixed price method"), or the price can be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data compiled by the <b>bookrunner</b> ("book building").|$|E
2500|$|Bonds {{are issued}} by public authorities, credit institutions, {{companies}} and supranational {{institutions in the}} primary markets. The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a syndicate, buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes {{the risk of being}} unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by bookrunners who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The <b>bookrunner</b> is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the tombstone ads commonly used to announce bonds to the public. [...] The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.|$|E
2500|$|A large IPO {{is usually}} underwritten by a [...] "syndicate" [...] of {{investment}} banks, {{the largest of}} which take the position of [...] "lead underwriter". Upon selling the shares, the underwriters retain {{a portion of the}} proceeds as their fee. This fee is called an underwriting spread. The spread is calculated as a discount from the price of the shares sold (called the gross spread). Components of an underwriting spread in an initial public offering (IPO) typically include the following (on a per share basis): Manager's fee, Underwriting fee—earned by members of the syndicate, and the Concession—earned by the broker-dealer selling the shares. The Manager would be entitled to the entire underwriting spread. A member of the syndicate is entitled to the underwriting fee and the concession. A broker dealer who is {{not a member of the}} syndicate but sells shares would receive only the concession, while the member of the syndicate who provided the shares to that broker dealer would retain the underwriting fee. Usually, the managing/lead underwriter, also known as the <b>bookrunner,</b> typically the underwriter selling the largest proportions of the IPO, takes the highest portion of the gross spread, up to 8% in some cases.|$|E

5000|$|In {{investment}} banking, a <b>bookrunner</b> {{is usually}} the main underwriter or lead-manager/arranger/coordinator in equity, debt, or hybrid securities issuances. The <b>bookrunner</b> usually syndicates with other investment banks in order to lower its risk. The <b>bookrunner</b> is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance. When more than one <b>bookrunner</b> manages a security issuance, the parties {{are referred to as}} [...] "joint bookrunners".|$|E
5000|$|Upon final {{signing of}} the full syndicate, the <b>Bookrunner</b> title may be {{forfeited}} to another lender. If amendments are made to the loan, the banks that committed to the original loan may retain their involvement in the deal as [...] "Mandated Arrangers". The <b>Bookrunner</b> title is then assigned to the banks comprising the new lender group.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "book" [...] is the {{off-market}} collation of investor {{demand by}} the <b>bookrunner</b> and is confidential to the <b>bookrunner,</b> issuer, and underwriter. Where shares are acquired, or transferred via a bookbuild, the transfer occurs off-market, and the transfer is not guaranteed by an exchange’s clearing house. Where an underwriter has been appointed, the underwriter bears {{the risk of}} non-payment by an acquirer or non-delivery by the seller.|$|E

50|$|A company {{planning}} an IPO typically appoints a lead manager, {{known as a}} <b>bookrunner,</b> to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the shares should be issued. There are two primary {{ways in which the}} price of an IPO can be determined.

50|$|Book {{building}} is a common practice in developed countries and has recently been making inroads into emerging markets as well. Bids may be submitted on-line, but the book is maintained off-market by the <b>bookrunner</b> and bids are confidential to the <b>bookrunner.</b> Unlike a public issue, the book building route will see minimum number of applications and large order size per application. The price at which new shares are issued is determined after the book is closed {{at the discretion of}} the <b>bookrunner</b> in consultation with the issuer. Generally, bidding is by invitation only to high-net-worth clients of the <b>bookrunner</b> and, if any, lead manager, or co-manager. Generally, securities laws require additional disclosure requirements to be met if the issue is to be offered to all investors. Consequently, participation in a book build may be limited to certain classes of investors. If retail clients are invited to bid, retail bidders are generally required to bid at the final price, which is unknown {{at the time of the}} bid, due to the impracticability of collecting multiple price point bids from each retail client. Although bidding is by invitation, the issuer and <b>bookrunner</b> retain discretion to give some bidders a greater allocation of their bids than other investors. Typically, large institutional bidders receive preference over smaller retail bidders, by receiving a greater allocation as a proportion of their initial bid. All book{{building is}} conducted ‘off-market’ and most stock exchanges have rules that require that on-market trading be halted during the bookbuilding process.|$|E
50|$|The key {{differences}} between acquiring shares via a bookbuild (conducted off-market) and trading (conducted on-market) are: 1) bids into the book are confidential vs transparent bid and ask prices on a stock exchange; 2) bidding is by invitation only (only high-net-worth clients of the <b>bookrunner</b> and any co-managers may bid); 3) the <b>bookrunner</b> and the issuer determine {{the price of}} the shares to be issued and the allocations of shares between bidders in their absolute discretion; 4) all shares are issued or transferred at the same price whereas on-market acquisitions provide for multiple trading prices.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{the decisions that}} issuers and their investment banks make about IPO pricing {{are affected by the}} pipeline of deals in registration, measured at the bank level. Examining IPOs from 2002 to 2013 we find evidence that measures of the IPO <b>bookrunner’s</b> pipeline significantly affect pricing decisions. The evidence is mostly consistent with a balanced view of a bank's role in IPO pricing in which it faces capacity constraints and agency conflicts but also strives to satisfy an issuer’s preference for lower initial returns...|$|R
40|$|With {{data from}} all the leading {{international}} investment banks on 220 IPOs raising $ 160 bn, we test the determinants of IPO allocations. We compare investors’ IPO allocations with proxies for their information production during the bookbuilding and the broking (and other) revenues those investors generate for <b>bookrunners.</b> We find evidence consistent with information revelation theories. We also find {{strong support for the}} existence of a quid pro quo: broking revenues are a significant driver of investors’ IPO allocations and profits. The quid pro quo remains when we control for any unobserved investor characteristics and investor-bank relationships...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{evidence}} from a dataset of 27 European IPOs to analyse how investors bid and {{the factors that}} influence their allocations. We have the complete books for these deals - amounting to 5540 bids - and so can analyse directly how bids and allocations are related. All these deals are private sector IPOs where the <b>bookrunner</b> was a leading European investment bank. We make use of a unique ranking of investor quality, associated with the likelihood of flipping the IPO, as produced by a group of US and European investment banks. We find that "high quality" investors are consistently favoured in allocation and in out-turn profits. We also find that bids submitted via the <b>bookrunner</b> and large bids received better pro-rata allocations and higher average profits. We find that a very small proportion of all bids submitted during the bookbuilding contain price limits - especially in hot IPOs - and, in contrast to Cornelli and Goldreich (2001), we do not find that that such bids are favoured in terms of allocation...|$|E
