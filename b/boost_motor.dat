40|$|Approaches are {{recommended}} {{for use by}} the NASA Solar System Exploration Committee (SSEC) in lowering the costs of planetary missions. The inclusion of off-the-shelf hardware, i. e., configurations currently in use for earth orbits and constructed on a nearly assembly-line basis, is suggested. Alterations would be necessary for the thermal control, power supply, telecommunications equipment, and attitude sensing in order to be serviceable as a planetary observer spacecraft. New technology can be developed only when cost reduction for the entire mission would be realized. The employment of lower-cost <b>boost</b> <b>motors,</b> or even integrated <b>boost</b> <b>motors,</b> for the transfer out of earth orbit is indicated, as is the development of instruments that do not redundantly gather the same data as previous planetary missions.

50|$|On 11 August 2005, {{the first}} Ariane 5 GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's {{improved}} solid <b>motors)</b> <b>boosted</b> Thaïcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at 6,505 kg, into orbit.|$|R
50|$|With {{a mass of}} 1370 kg at launch, AMOS-2 {{incorporated}} a 400 newton Liquid Apogee <b>Boost</b> <b>Motor</b> (ABM) and fourteen 10 newton Reaction Control Thrusters for raising the satellite's orbit from Geostationary Transfer orbit to its final geostationary orbit {{as well as for}} its attitude control. It carried 450 kg of propellant (monomethyl hydrazine and MON-1).|$|E
50|$|In {{some parts}} of the space {{industry}} an LAE is also referred to as a liquid apogee motor (LAM), a liquid apogee thruster (LAT) and, depending on the propellant, a dual-mode liquid apogee thruster (DMLAT). Despite the ambiguity with respect to the use of engine and motor in these names, all use liquid propellant. An apogee kick motor (AKM) or apogee <b>boost</b> <b>motor</b> (ABM) such as the Waxwing, however, uses solid propellant. These solid-propellant versions are not used on new-generation satellites.|$|E
50|$|The Hipparcos {{satellite}} {{was launched}} (with the direct broadcast satellite TV-SAT2 as co-passenger) on an Ariane 4 launch vehicle, flight V33, from Kourou, French Guiana, on 8 August 1989. Launched into a geostationary transfer orbit, the Mage-2 apogee <b>boost</b> <b>motor</b> failed to fire, and the intended geostationary orbit was never achieved. However, {{with the addition}} of further ground stations, in addition to the primary ground station at Odenwald in Germany, the satellite was successfully operated in its geostationary transfer orbit for almost 3.5 years. All of the original mission goals were, eventually, exceeded.|$|E
25|$|By mid-century, railroads {{had begun}} to eclipse canals in the United States, {{although}} the Morris Canal remained in heavy use through the 1860s. It was leased to the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1871, {{taken over by the}} state of New Jersey late in 1922, and formally abandoned in 1924. This was a common fate in the era for many enterprises formerly reliant on anthracite volumeby the 1920s, oil fuels had been steadily eroding the market share of anthracite in heating, and the automobiles were becoming common, whilst World War I had given a <b>boost</b> to <b>motor</b> truck (Lorry) development.|$|R
50|$|Other {{recovered}} orbiter components {{showed no}} indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water.

40|$|Human {{actions are}} driven by the pursuit of goals, {{especially}} when achieving these goals entails a reward. Accordingly, recent work showed that anticipating a reward in a motor task influences the <b>motor</b> system, <b>boosting</b> <b>motor</b> excitability and increasing overall readiness. Attaining a reward typically requires some mental or physical effort. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggested that both reward expectation and effort requirements are encoded by a partially overlapping brain network. Moreover, reward and effort information are combined in an integrative value signal. However, whether and how mental effort is integrated with reward at the motor level during task preparation remains unclear. To address these issues, we implemented a mental effort task where reward expectation and effort requirements were manipulated. During task preparation, TMS was delivered on the motor cortex and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded on the right hand muscles to probe motor excitability. The results showed an interaction of effort and reward in modulating the motor system, reflecting an unsigned value prediction-error signal. Crucially, this was observed in the motor system in absence of a value-based decision or value-driven action selection. This suggests a high-level cognitive factor such as unsigned value prediction-error can modulate the motor system. Interestingly, effort-related motor excitability was also modulated by individual differences in tendency to engage in (and enjoy) mental effort, {{as measured by the}} Need for Cognition questionnaire, underlining a role of subjective effort experience in value-driven preparation for action...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that gene therapy can rescue the phenotype and extend lifespan in the delta-sarcoglycan deficient cardiomyopathic hamster. In patients with similar genetic defects, steroids {{have been largely}} used to slow down disease progression. Aim of our study was to evaluate the combined effects of steroid treatment and gene therapy on cardiac function. We injected the human delta-sarcoglycan cDNA by adeno-associated virus (AAV) 2 / 8 by a single intraperitoneal injection into BIO 14. 6 Syrian hamsters at ten days of age to rescue the phenotype. We then treated the hamsters with deflazacort. Treatment was administered to half of the hamsters that had received the AAV and the other hamsters without AAV, {{as well as to}} normal hamsters. Both horizontal and vertical activities were greatly enhanced by deflazacort in all groups. As in previous experiments, the AAV treatment alone was able to preserve the ejection fraction (70 ± 7 % EF). However, the EF value declined (52 ± 14 %) with a combination of AAV and deflazacort. This was similar with all the other groups of affected animals. We confirm that gene therapy improves cardiac function in the BIO 14. 6 hamsters. Our results suggest that deflazacort is ineffective and may also {{have a negative impact on}} the cardiomyopathy rescue, possibly by <b>boosting</b> <b>motor</b> activity.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the search for effective forms and ways of <b>boosting</b> <b>motor</b> activity of the student youth during the period of study at higher education institutions. The research proves that this is achieved by means of introducing some popular among young people fitness technologies, and cheerleading in particular, into the framework of academic classes on physical education at higher learning institutions, considering the gender issues, individual characteristics as well as material and technical resources. The genesis of cheerleading as a kind of dance sports, which combines elements of aerobics, gymnastics, choreography and a dance show, is determined in relation to foreign and national sports traditions. The article describes therapeutic, developmental and upbringing potential of cheerleading to improve the efficiency of gender-specific organization of university students’ physical education. The main objectives of introducing cheerleading classes into the higher school curriculum are outlined as follows: increasing motivation for doing exercise, optimizing motor activity, developing endurance, flexibility and agility as well as self-discipline, tolerance, sociability, communication and organizational skills, generating an abiding interest in a healthy lifestyle. The article presents the most effective ways of attaining the above-stated objectives, such as creation of the cheerleading section {{on the basis of the}} department of fitness aerobics, incorporation of some elements of cheerleading into the physical education curriculum, creation of faculty teams on the basis of academic departments, formation of the university team on the basis of faculty teams).

25|$|In {{comparison}} to the older engine, {{the position of the}} inlet trumpets and exhaust manifolds had been switched, so that the exhausts exited on the upper surface of the engine, within the cylinder vee, and the inlets protruded above the chassis pontoons {{on either side of the}} car. Between the chassis pontoons the engine was covered with a removable, curved panel. Completing the engine cowling was a near-circular gearbox and differential cover at the rear, through which the tail pipes of the exhausts protruded. Shifting the inlets to the outer edges of the car allowed the engine to ingest cooler, denser air, <b>boosting</b> the <b>motor's</b> power output. The compact exhaust bundle also allowed a svelte packaging of the engine bay. However, the heat build-up from the confined manifold necessitated cutting a hole in the top of the engine cover. Despite this, the BRM P261's barrel-shaped rear end became one of its most distinctive visual characteristics.|$|R

We conducted two high-powered direct replications {{of the effects of}} power on golf, two online conceptual replications using mirror-tracing as a performance measure, and an additional conceptual replication using a cognitive performance measure (word-search). Overall, we found little to no effect of power on motor skill (d = 0. 09, 95 % CI[- 0. 07, 0. 22], n = 603). We varied task difficulty, re-analyzed data without participants showing weak responses on manipulation checks, and tried adjusting performance scores for age, gender, and initial task skill.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the primary motor cortex (M 1) plays a critical role in implementing the fast and transient post-training phase of motor skill consolidation, known to yield an early boost in performance. Whether a comparable early boost in performance occurs following motor imagery (MIM) training is still unknown. To address this issue, two groups of subjects learned a finger tapping sequence either by MIM or physical practice (PP). In both groups, performance increased significantly in the post-training phase when compared with the pre-training phase and further increased after a 30 min resting period, indicating that both MIM and PP trainings were equally efficient and induced an early <b>boost</b> in <b>motor</b> performance. This conclusion was corroborated by the results of an additional control group. In a second experiment, we then investigated the causal role of M 1 in implementing the early boost process resulting from MIM training. To do so, we inhibited M 1 by applying a continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) in healthy volunteers just after they learnt, by MIM, the same finger-tapping task as in Experiment # 1. As a control, cTBS was applied over the vertex of subjects who underwent the same experiment. We found that cTBS applied over M 1 selectively abolished the early boost process subsequent to MIM training. Altogether, the present study provides evidence that MIM practice induces an early boost in performance and demonstrates that M 1 is causally involved in this process. These findings further divulge som...|$|R
