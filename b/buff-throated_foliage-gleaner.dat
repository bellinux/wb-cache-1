Tiny birds are lightweight enough to hang onto the ends of twigs and pluck small prey; the goldcrest of Europe and its counterpart the golden-crowned kinglet of North America exhibit this feeding style. The related common firecrest is very similar in size and shape, but slightly bulkier, and has less of a tendency to glean along twigs {{and more of a}} habit of flying from perch to perch. Having a very small bill seems to be good for taking tiny prey from the surfaces of leaves, and small-billed birds such as the blue tit forage in broad-leafed woodlands. The long-billed gnatwren and speckled spinetail of Central and South America, and the ashy tailorbird and striped tit-babbler of South Asia, show a preference for gleaning in tangles of vines. [...] The ash-browed spinetail of South America specializes in gleaning among epiphytes on moss-covered tree branches. Many hummingbirds take small insects from flowers while probing for nectar, and some species glean actively among bark and leaves. The Puerto Rican emerald is one such hummingbird. Found only on the island of Puerto Rico, the female subsists on insects and spiders, while the male has a typical hummingbird diet of nectar. [...] Hummingbirds and other gleaners are also sometimes attracted to the sap wells created by sapsuckers. [...] Sapsuckers, which are in the woodpecker family, drill small holes in living tree branches to get the sap flowing. The sap and the insects it attracts are then consumed, and rufous hummingbirds have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source. Clusters of dead leaves also often harbor invertebrate prey, and the Bewick's wren and worm-eating warbler of North America have long bills well-suited for probing them, as do certain Asian babblers, such as the rusty-cheeked scimitar-babbler.

30|$|We amplified and sequenced borer DNA {{from the}} feces of six species: <b>Buff-throated</b> <b>Foliage-Gleaner</b> (Passeriformes: Furnariidae Automolus ochrolaemus; {{detected}} in 1 of 8 samples), Common Tody-Flycatcher (Passeriformes: Tyrannidae Todirostrum cinereum; 1 of 4), Rufous-breasted Wren (Passeriformes: Troglodytidae Pheugopedius rutilus; 1 of 18), Rufous-capped Warbler (Passeriformes: Parulidae Basileuterus rufifrons; 5 of 66), White-tailed Emerald (Apodiformes: Trochilidae Elvira chionura; 1 of 2), and Yellow Warbler (Passeriformes: Parulidae Setophaga petechia; 1 of 26). The majority of detections (8 of 10) {{were derived from}} surveys conducted in 2010 and reported in Karp et al. (2013), even though fewer samples were collected in 2010 (478 vs. 961 samples). In total, 30 (Jaramillo et al. primers) and 27 (our developed primers) samples yielded PCR products of the expected size range, 4 and 6 of which were > 98 % sequence similar to borers.|$|E
