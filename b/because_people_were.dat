Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> more likely to sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E

Rabbi Jose bar Hanina reported that Johanan the High Priest did so <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not presenting the tithe as {{mandated by the}} Torah.

The United States embassy told tourists to go to Mérida, although {{the next day they}} had to change their announcements because Mérida had become so packed with people. The road to Mérida was very dangerous and practically impassable for taxis, yet people dealt with the exorbitant fees being charged for passage.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{conflict}} with Zionism helped to make Palestinian Arab society more conservative in cultural, social, religious and political affairs <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> highly motivated to preserve their distinct heritage and identity against the dual impact of British colonialism and Jewish innovation. Traditionally, the Arabs had an elite, but not a real leadership. Both of these things changed {{over the course of}} the 1930s. During this period new political organizations and new types of activist began to appear, marking the involvement of a far broader cross-section of the population; in particular, nationalism, which had been long-rooted in rural society began to take hold in urban society.|$|E

It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1970s, Namsskogan had {{experienced}} a rapid decline in the population, from 1,750 to 1,000 in the early 1990s.

He argued that the three main industries in Namsskogan—agriculture, forestry and tourism—all had their peaks during May through October, but that it was difficult to get sufficient work-force during this period <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> on holiday. The municipality offered [...] to anyone who took their three-week summer vacation during the winter. Ryan also introduced a public service office, where residents could be served with all necessary public over-the-counter services at one place. For people living outside the community center, a cooperation was made with local stores where people could send in standardized application there. Some simple applications, such as erecting a simple garage, were approved on the spot at the service office.

2500|$|The Volcano at the {{southern}} end of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province just north of the Alaska-British Columbia boundary is probably the youngest in Canada. It is a poorly built cinder cone made of loose volcanic ash, lapilli-sized tephra and volcanic bombs. Lying above a remote mountain ridge in the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains, it is responsible for lava flow eruptions in 1904 and older that traveled south [...] through river valleys where they crossed the border into the U.S. state of Alaska and dammed the Blue River, a short tributary of the Unuk River. In doing so it formed several small lakes. This eruption had a massive effect on fish, plant and animal inhabitants of the valley, but there is no record of its impact on people, most likely <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not in the remote area. The entire length of the lava flows are at least [...] and still contain the original lava features from when they were erupted, including pressure ridges and lava channels. However, sections of the lava flows have collapsed into underlying lava tubes to form cavities. Tephra and scoria from The Volcano covers adjacent mountain ridges and even through it is very young, it has been reduced by erosion from alpine glacial ice found in the heavily glaciated Coast Mountains.

2500|$|Kitana {{was chosen}} as the best Mortal Kombat II fighter by the editors of Sega Power and Super Play for being [...] "good all around" [...] and due to her quick attacks and {{perceived}} similarities to Chun-Li. Amiga Power too called her [...] "a really good character to pick" [...] and Cinema Blend stated Kitana [...] "could absolutely dominate" [...] the game. However, GamePro's strategy guide ranked Kitana as only the seventh best of the 12 fighters in MKII (citing her devastating combos, powerful [...] "Fan Throw" [...] move, and good sweep and reach hindered by slow release of the fan-based special moves and limited attack patterns); it was her clone Mileena who landed on the top of their chart. According to a retrospective by Complex, Kitana [...] "had the most powerful projectile attack, and along with Mileena, the fastest throws and sweeps." [...] "Kitana's big combos in the corner" [...] were among Ed Boon's own personal favourite things in the game: [...] "When I saw people do Kitana's combos I knew there was something special, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> taking the game to a new direction."

[...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> making fun of how stupid it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement".

[...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky."

But when the danger is over and the calamity has had its day, then there is all too quickly a relapse into the old ways of life, and the reconciliation coerced by the need sometimes carries within itself the seed of a deeper separation than the one that was eliminated. And even if that reconciliation casts an enhancing radiance over the period of the individual's lives, it nevertheless belongs essentially not to them but to the observation and the observer who inherits it, until the story about it is also forgotten. Even though it is beautiful to envision this, such a life is a life of temporality, is the fruit of temporality, but also the prey of temporality, and the most that can be said of it is that it was a beautiful moment.
