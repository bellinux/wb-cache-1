5|$|In 1979, Madonna {{was trying}} to {{establish}} her career in the music industry. She was the drummer of a band called Breakfast Club, which was headed by the Gilroy brothers, Dan and Ed. After their lead female vocalist left, Madonna was given {{the role of the}} lead female singer. However, she wanted to be the only female voice of the band, and opposed against the introduction of another female vocalist, Angie Smith. This led to a dispute between Dan and her, which resulted in Madonna leaving the band. She then formed a new band called Madonna and The Sky, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> faced a major problem within a few weeks when its principal drummer Mike Shenoy, who had a full-time job and a fiancé, decided to leave the band.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there is}} no way to reach N = 184 close to the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the proton number past 118, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> greatly diminishes the cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow the production of the more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the closed shell. 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way of reaching the centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha daughters are near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E
25|$|The CAP has {{furthermore}} been criticised due to {{its effect}} on farmland bird populations. Between 1980 and 2009, the farmland bird population has decreased from 600 million to 300 million, implying a loss of 50%. Among the species that have been hit hardest are the starling and the tree sparrow, which have both declines by 53%. The removal of hedgerows and ploughing over meadows are two significant factors that {{may have contributed to}} more efficient farming, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> caused a decrease in farmland birds' habitats.|$|E

25|$|Data mining {{requires}} {{data preparation}} which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way {{for this to}} occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) {{in a way that}} facilitates analysis (<b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent). This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} {{absolute and}} relative dating methods, a chronological framework {{has been built}} for Mesopotamia that still incorporates many uncertainties <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> continues to be refined. In this framework, many prehistorical and early historical periods have been defined {{on the basis of}} material culture that is thought to be representative for each period. These periods are often named after the site at which the material was recognized for the first time, as is for example the case for the Halaf, Ubaid and Jemdet Nasr periods. When historical documents become widely available, periods tend to be named after the dominant dynasty or state; examples of this are the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods. While reigns of kings can be securely dated for the 1st millennium BC, there is an increasingly large error margin toward the 2nd and 3rd millennia BC.|$|E

[...] A52 then pitched their idea to Carnivàle executives in early 2003, who felt that the company's proposal was the most creative for the series' concept. The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork, each scanned transparency being up to 300MB in size. The resulting images were photoshopped and digitally rendered.

[...] The creators offered a detailed interpretation of the tarot cards in the opening titles, and covered topics like good and bad, heaven and hell, wars, and the age of science as the antireligion in the 1930s. The following list specifies the tarot cards featured in the opening sequence, the provided keywords and the used artwork.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disappointing".

He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is for the kids. It’s simple and easy to follow, and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best thing that could have happened to it." ...|$|E

She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career.

Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we’ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> is something that’s going to have to unveil itself gradually," [...] he stated.

2500|$|Other critics reacted less {{positively}} to the film.

Sam Adams of IndieWire argued that the unanimous praise for Boyhood is bad for film criticism, as it tends to marginalize the analysis of critics who disagree with the majority; Adams further elaborated that masterpieces are not made [...] "by unanimous praise, but by careful scrutiny".
