Bruni's first two periods were <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>those</b> of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
5|$|Sarah Trost was {{the costume}} {{designer}} for The FP; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence. She was also {{inspired by the}} fashions of Elvis Presley, and the films Double Dragon, Rocky, Mad Max, The Warriors, 8 Mile, Escape from New York, X-Men, {{as well as the}} works of John Carpenter. Trost based the opposing gangs' outfits on American military uniforms of the American Civil War era. The 245's outfits were based on the uniforms of the Confederate Army, while the 248's outfits were <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>those</b> of the Union Army. The flags of the gangs were also <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>those</b> of the Confederacy and the Union. Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty. Most of the costumes were made from materials available to the crew; L Dubba E's costumes were made from jumpsuits. The boots worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots. Most of the base clothing came from thrift stores, Sarah Trost's fabric storage, and the Trost's childhood clothing.|$|E

5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia).

Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts.

5|$|Changes {{were made}} in 1876, {{introducing}} more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>those</b> worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially of rather low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey overcoats with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were available until the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, blue pea jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police {{as part of their}} winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards. There were continual attempts to produce a consistent uniform across the force, but this was only ever partially successful due to the multiple government suppliers who each produced slightly different variants.|$|E
5|$|Freemasons, {{members of}} a European fraternal {{organization}} that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century, developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times. Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions. After Sethos was published, several Masonic lodges developed rites <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>those</b> in the novel. Late in the century, Masonic writers, still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story, used the obvious resemblance between their rites and the initiation of Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry's supposedly ancient origin. Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson's Egyptian initiation: trials by three or four elements, often taking place under the pyramids. The best-known of these works is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 1791 opera The Magic Flute, in which the main character, Tamino, undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris.|$|E

The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>those</b> animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population.
