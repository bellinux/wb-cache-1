5|$|A Scottish {{study showed}} that {{mortality}} in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%.

5|$|Hualālai last {{erupted in}} 1801. A severe {{earthquake}} swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month. This caused $100,000 worth {{of damage to}} the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were felt {{as far away as}} Honolulu. This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> surface activity or eruption.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard find was ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard.

Buffalo had already arrived, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E
5|$|Alex's outer rainbands {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} across Virginia, peaking at over 7inches (178mm) {{in the center}} of the state. The rainfall caused localized flooding, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> reported damage in the state. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had to be rescued when they were trapped by a jetty. In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers.|$|E
5|$|At least fifteen people, {{including}} rioters and soldiers, {{were killed}} in the riot, and at least fifty people were injured. Under Governor Porter's orders, state troops continued to arrive in the city in the days afterwards, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> further violence. An estimated 5,000 militia were used to stop violence. Troops began to withdraw from the city on July 10, and the church took over responsibility from the district of Southwark of protecting the church on July 11. As with the May riots, a grand jury blamed the Irish Catholics for the riots, but supported the military's response to the violence.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> time to pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers {{was the key to}} the survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek {{was found by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to have good {{temperatures}} for trout habitation, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek {{is considered to be}} a cold-water fishery between its headwaters and its confluence with Rattling Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.|$|E
