5|$|The new Greenville Bridge {{opened to}} traffic on August 4, 2010. In 2011 the massive process of {{removing}} the old bridge by cutting into small sections to <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> was begun, and {{was expected to}} be completed by September 2012. At times the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous and two workers have died.|$|E
5|$|It took {{sixteen years}} from the initial {{developing}} stage begun in 1994, until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. The entire cost of the bridge totaled $336 million. In 2011, the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> was begun, {{and is expected to}} be completed by September 2012. At times, the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous and at least two workers have died.|$|E
50|$|According to the USGS in 2006, 2.9 {{million tonnes}} of Portland cement {{concrete}} (including aggregate) worth $21.9 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled,</b> and 1.6 million tonnes of asphalt concrete (including aggregate) worth $11.8 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled,</b> both by crushed stone operations. Much more of both materials <b>are</b> <b>recycled</b> by construction and demolition firms {{not in the}} USGS survey. For sand and gravel, the USGS survey for 2006 showed that 4.7 million tonnes of cement concrete valued at $32.0 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled,</b> and 6.17 million tonnes of asphalt concrete valued at $45.1 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled.</b> Again, more of both materials <b>are</b> <b>recycled</b> by construction and demolition firms not in this USGS survey. The Construction Materials Recycling Association indicates that there are 325 million tonnes of recoverable construction and demolition materials produced annually.|$|R

5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Bc5 may {{not seem}} {{particularly}} useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 it {{makes it difficult for}} White to play f4 to chase away the black knight; furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> to the b8–h2 diagonal via Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still more pressure on h2. It can also stay on the a7–g1 diagonal to put pressure on f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{recycling}} {{facility and}} museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and opened in 1993. Funding for the museum was provided through a group of 19 local municipalities, known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee, which transported recyclables to the facility for processing. The museum {{was part of an}} active recycling operation that allows visitors to follow the recyclable materials through the sorting processes to the crushing and baling process before they are shipped to processors to <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> into new products. The museum was overseen and operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority.|$|E
50|$|Aluminum cans {{are often}} made with {{recycled}} aluminum; approximately 68% {{of a standard}} North American can <b>is</b> <b>recycled</b> aluminum.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> to form other star systems.|$|E
