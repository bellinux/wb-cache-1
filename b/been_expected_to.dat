5|$|The current bridge along Grand Avenue {{over the}} Colorado River and I-70 {{just east of}} the highway's western {{terminus}} dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane in either direction. By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> and was in poor structural condition.|$|E

Franks had been a last-minute choice because New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> run for the Senate. The record $62million amount surpassed Michael Huffington, who spent nearly $28million in an unsuccessful 1994 Senate race.|$|E

Although the film had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be the number one film for the weekend, it took $10.5million on the opening Saturday, falling behind the animated film Puss in Boots ($15.3million). Tower Heist became the number two film for the weekend with $24million, behind Puss in Boots ($34million), with 70% of the audience being over the age of 25—the largest segment, 27%, being over 50—and 56% male.

5|$|The women's {{skeleton}} {{event at}} the 2010 Winter Olympics {{took place at the}} Whistler Sliding Centre on 18–19 February. The competition was won by British athlete Amy Williams, who set new course records for the track on her first and third runs. Williams, who had never before won a World Cup or World Championship event, became the first British athlete to win a solo Winter Olympic gold medal in 30 years. German sliders Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman, who had won the silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Canadian Mellisa Hollingsworth, both of whom had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be in medal contention, were disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} criticized {{for a lack of}} {{production}} during the regular season and was ranked 103rd in total offense. The Hokies gained just 301 yards of offense on average during the regular season. Despite the meager statistical performance, Tech did have some standout players. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> sit out the season in reserve, finished the year as the team's starter. Running back Darren Evans was named a second-team All-ACC selection, as was guard Sergio Render. Taylor's favorite passing targets were wide receivers Danny Coale and Jarrett Boykin. Coale entered the ACC Championship Game having caught 32 catches for 352 yards, while Boykin grabbed 27 passes for 407 yards.|$|E

5|$|At {{least in}} part resentful of the French king's {{previous}} support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly {{in support of his}} brother-in-law Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefitting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|Following that loss, Virginia Tech {{head coach}} Frank Beamer {{announced}} that backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor, {{who had previously}} <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> sit out the season on redshirt status, would play in the Hokies' second game, against Furman. Both Taylor and starting quarterback Sean Glennon performed well against the Paladins, and Tech won, 24–7. Tech's third game came against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, who were employing a new offensive system, the option offense, under first-year head coach Paul Johnson. Unlike the game against Furman, Taylor started the game and remained at quarterback throughout, guiding the Hokies to their first ACC victory of the season, a 20–17 win that later gave Tech a crucial head-to-head tiebreaker against the Yellow Jackets, fellow members of the Coastal Division. The Hokies' fourth {{game of the season}} came against the North Carolina Tar Heels, who were defeated by the same margin of victory as Tech's win against Georgia Tech, 20–17.|$|E

A Type 274 set was fitted for main armament fire direction. On 17 June 1945, with the war in Europe at an end, Belfast sailed for the Far East via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo and Sydney. By the time she arrived in Sydney on 7 August Belfast had been made flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet. While in Sydney Belfast underwent another short refit, supplementing her close-range armament with five 40mm Bofors guns. Belfast had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> join in Operation Downfall, but this was forestalled by the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

5|$|Queen's Park {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the second half, and a series of rapid attacks followed the break. The Scottish team were only prevented from scoring in one goal mouth scramble by the teamwork of Arthur and Suter. Rovers appeared to have switched to a defensive posture, and conceded a further corner kick, but nothing came of it as Gow kicked it behind the goal. A further handball just inside the Queen's Park half resulted in a solitary attack for Blackburn, ending in Brown sending the ball over the crossbar. Further attacks Queen's Park followed, but one further attack from Blackburn led to a shot from Brown which many in the crowd thought crossed the line before Gillespie cleared it. Blackburn dominated the final five minutes of the game, and the match ended 2–1; all three goals were scored in the first half. The medals and trophy had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be awarded by Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, however due to his death on the day before the final, they were not presented publicly. Instead, Major Marindin handed them over in the dressing rooms.|$|E
5|$|Several ferries in the New York City {{area were}} {{affected}} when plans for NYC Ferry were made public. NY Waterway would give over its East River route to NYC Ferry. New York Water Taxi remained separate, but was to eliminate 200 jobs; it had stated {{that if it}} did not win the contract with the city to operate NYC Ferry, then it would shut down. Since the company did not win the NYC Ferry contract, it had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> shut down in October 2016, but continued operations {{through the end of the}} year before being purchased by Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises in January 2017. The city-owned Staten Island Ferry remains a separate entity. In addition, the ferry service would add 155 jobs to the New York Harbor area.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E

5|$|The mission {{consisted}} of about forty missionaries, {{some of whom}} were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted {{by the nature of the}} task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return, which Gregory refused, and instead sending Augustine back with letters to encourage the missionaries to persevere. Another reason for the pause may have been the receipt of news of the death of King Childebert II, who had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> help the missionaries; Augustine may have returned to Rome to secure new instructions and letters of introduction, as well as to update Gregory on the new political situation in Gaul. Most likely, they halted in the Rhone valley. Gregory also took the opportunity to name Augustine as abbot of the mission. Augustine then returned to the rest of the missionaries, with new instructions, probably including orders to seek consecration as a bishop on the Continent if the conditions in Kent warranted it.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E
5|$|The spill was the {{culmination}} of a dispute within the Liberal Party over its response to the Rudd Government's proposed emissions trading scheme (ETS). Turnbull supported the introduction of an ETS and sought to negotiate amendments to government's proposed legislation. Abbott came to represent many Liberal members of Parliament who were climate change sceptics or otherwise opposed the ETS. After Turnbull survived a spill motion (a motion to declare the leadership vacant) against his leadership in late November 2009, Abbott declared his candidacy and a subsequent spill was moved on 1 December. Hockeya moderate who had been a supporter of Turnbull's position on the ETSalso stood. While Hockey had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win, he was knocked out {{in the first round of}} voting.
