As he jumped off of the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grain truck, his wedding ring {{got caught in the}} wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger.

5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, {{as well as some of}} the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun.

In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> truck.|$|E

5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay.

In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E

Born in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E
