25|$|The case {{attracted}} some {{media coverage}} at the time, because Nigg had formerly {{worked at the}} Mezzaluna restaurant in Brentwood, {{where he had been}} a friend of Ronald Goldman's. Almost 15 months earlier, Goldman and Nicole <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson</b> had been found slain at her home near the restaurant, after he had gone there to return her mother's eyeglasses, which had been left behind at Mezzaluna.

The prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson</b> on January 1, 1989. She expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling {{at her in the}} background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented.

25|$|The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office prosecuted Simpson for {{the killings}} of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson,</b> {{based on the}} theory that Simpson, who had had a history of {{domestic}} violence with her, had acted in a fit of rage upon realizing that {{she was not going to}} return to him. Simpson himself, according to his lawyers, believed that the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, her former husband believed, had been planning to open a restaurant of her own using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.|$|E
