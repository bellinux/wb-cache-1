A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths.

25|$|There are a {{huge number}} of ways of diversifying. Farmland may, for example, be {{converted}} to equestrian facilities, amenity parkland, country clubs, hotels, golf courses, camping and caravan sites. Farmers open shops, restaurants and even pubs to sell their products. The Farm Diversification <b>Benchmarking</b> <b>Study,</b> which was commissioned by DEFRA and carried out by Exeter University in conjunction with the University of Plymouth, found that 65% of full-time farming businesses had diversified, but in the June census of the preceding year (2003), the estimate was 19% of full-time farming businesses. The large discrepancy is probably because the census data excluded the letting or subletting of buildings. The most common kinds of diversification are probably letting of barns as warehouses and storage, letting of former farm labourers' cottages (whether as holiday cottages or on longer leases), and farm shops. The number of farm shops in the UK increased by more than 50% between 1999 and 2003.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection based on a statistical model updating methodology which utilizes the measured vibration responses of the. structure without any knowledge of the input excitation. The emphasis in this paper is on {{the application of the}} proposed methodology in Phase I of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>study</b> setup by the IASC-ASCE Task Group on structural health monitoring. Details of this SHM <b>benchmark</b> <b>study</b> are available on the Task Group web site at ([URL] wusceel. cive. wustl. edu/asce. shm). The <b>benchmark</b> <b>study</b> focuses on important issues, such as: (1) measurement noise; (2) modeling error; (3) lack of input measurements; and (4) limited number of sensors. A statistical methodology for model updating is adopted in this paper to establish stiffness reductions due to damage. This methodology allows for an explicit treatment of the measurement noise, modeling error; and possible nonuniqueness issues characterizing this inverse problem. The paper briefly describes the methodology and reports on the results obtained in detecting damage in all six cases of Phase I of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>study</b> assuming unknown (ambient) data. The performance, limitations, and difficulties encountered by the proposed statistical methodology are discussed...|$|R
