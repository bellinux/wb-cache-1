When patients experience an internal/external surrogate drift, an update of the correlation model is required to continue tumor tracking. In this study, {{the accuracy of the}} internal tumor position estimation for both the clinical available update at discrete points in time (rebuild) and an in-house developed non-clinical online update approach was investigated. METHODS: A dynamic phantom with superimposed <b>baseline</b> <b>drifts</b> and 14 SBRT patients, treated with real-time tumor tracking (RTTT) on the Vero system, were retrospectively simulated for three update scenarios, respectively no update, clinical rebuild and 0. 5 Hz automated online update of the correlation model. By comparing the target positions based on 0. 5 Hz verification X-ray images with the estimated internal tumor positions regarding all three update scenarios, 95 th percentile modeling errors (ME 95), incidences of full geometrical coverage of the CTV by a 5 mm extended PTV (P₅mm) and population-based PTV margins were calculated. Further, the treatment time reduction was estimated when switching from the clinical rebuild approach to the online correlation model update. RESULTS: For dynamic phantom motion with <b>baseline</b> <b>drifts</b> up to 0. 4 mm/min, a 0. 5 Hz intra-fraction update showed a similar accuracy in terms of ME 95 and P 5 mm compared to clinical rebuild. For SBRT patients treated on Vero with RTTT, accuracy was improved by 0. 5 Hz online update compared to the clinical rebuild protocol, yielding smaller PTV margins (from 3. 2 mm to 2. 7 mm), reduced ME 95, 3 D (from 4. 1 mm to 3. 4 mm) and an increased 5 th percentile P 5 mm (from 90. 7 % to 96. 1 %) for the entire patient group. Further, 80 % of treatment sessions were reduced in time with on average 5. 5 ± 4. 1 (1 SD) min. CONCLUSION: With a fast (0. 5 Hz) automated online update of the correlation model, an efficient RTTT workflow with improved geometrical accuracy was obtained. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
