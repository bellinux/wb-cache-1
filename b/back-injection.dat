40|$|An organic floating-gate {{memory device}} using CdSe quantum dots (QDs) as a charge-trapping element was fabricated. CdSe QDs were {{localized}} beneath a pentacene without any tunneling insulator, and the QD layer {{played a role}} as hole-trapping sites. The band bending formed at the junction between pentacene and QD layers inhibited <b>back-injection</b> of holes trapped in CdSe into pentacene, which appeared as a hysteretic capacitance-voltage response during {{the operation of the}} device. Nearly, 60 % of trapped charge was sustained even after 104 s in programmed state, and this long retention time can be potentially useful in practical applications of non-volatile memory...|$|E
