The mixed powder consisted of a mixture of a powdered Ni base filler (GNi- 3) and powdered <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> (GTD- 111). The range of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powder was 40 to 70 wt%. Bonding was performed at a temperature of 1463 K, using various holding time. In {{the case of a}} lower 50 wt%, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powders completely melted and <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> mating at the interface dissolved at an early time, and extent of dissolution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> decreased with increasing mixing ratio. Liquid was eliminated by isothermal solidification, which was controlled by the diffusion of B into the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The solids in the bonded interlayer grew epitaxially from the mating <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> inward from the insert metal and the number of grain boundaries formed at the bonded interlayer corresponded with those of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The finishing time for isothermal solidification was about 74 ks. In the case 60 wt % and higher, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powders partially melted and remained in the vicinity of bonded interlayer. The solid was formed from the remaining powder and <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> mating at the interface. Finally, the bonded interlayer underwent the poly-crystallization when isothermal solidification was complete.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present three {{papers on the}} Economics of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The thesis studies production, trading, and {{investment}} in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry, and thus explains some phenomena of the industry in an international context. Using {{the features of the}} <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry such as the practices in production and trading, physical properties, geology of the deposits and so on, we build theoretical models to simulate the behavior of the industry. In Chapter One, we study the determinants and the trend of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices over time by an equilibrium model of supply and demand. Because the different types of natural resources exhibit different patterns of price changes in history, we particularly simulate the long run equilibrium to study the impacts of the determinants for <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices. The Cobb-Douglass production function on the supply side allows substitution among production factors. The demand function for <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> from the economy is also derived. In the long run, equilibrium of aggregate supply and demand determines the systematic price trend. We show how trends of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices depend on technological progress, resource scarcity, natural resource tax, and the interest rate. Assuming constant returns to scale in <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> production, the price elasticity of the supply of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> is relatively small. Interestingly, a high natural resource tax leads to a high price but low rate of price change over time. On the supply side, the decline of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> relative prices can thus be explained by the inverse supply functions. On the demand side, the relative price is also declining over time as we see the implications of the inverse demand functions and our numerical illustrations. By solving the equilibrium condition, we show that the economic rent of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> minerals in reserve may decline over time, or even not be valuable in future. The price elasticities of supply and demand are calculated and decomposed into specific effects. These are systematic components of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> price changes in the world market. Chapter Two deals with the fluctuations in the prices of <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> We consider the price in the short run as an equilibrium of trade. If the long run equilibrium regulates the prices and sets them in a stabilization, then the fluctuations in price are caused by the trade and speculative activities. By simulating speculative activities and optimizing the utility of agents in international exchanges, we show that the price fluctuations are the response to risk preferences of agents and the scale of international exchanges. We find out the critical point of production investment, which depends on the market demand, profitability of the metal industry, and the distribution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> minerals in nature. In the specific case of the industry versus the market condition when the uncertain production is above the critical point, the price of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> fluctuates more or less according to the number of producer offers in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> exchanges, the speculative activities, and risk preferences of agents. In contrast, if the investment level of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry in uncertain production is below the critical point, the effects of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> exchanges scale to the price are in the reverse direction. The comparative statics inequalities are derived to clarify the responses of the price to the risk preferences of agents and scale of the international exchanges. Hence, the non-systematic changes of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices in international exchanges are explained. Chapter Three studies the impact of the industrial and commercial processes on investment decisions in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The investment decisions of investors in the primary capital market and the stock price in the secondary capital market reflect properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry in capital markets. We present a model of investments, which is a two stage game that incorporates Hall-Jorgenson neoclassical investment analysis and properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The paper presents a set of explanatory parameters for the properties of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stocks and analyzes the investment decisions. We define the industry factor and explain the empirical observations on the beta coefficient of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stocks. The relationships between stock prices and <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices are clarified using the geology of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> deposits. The results show that there is a strong impact of the industry factor on the volatility of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stock prices. Economies of scale in the mining industry lead to different effects of tax policy and output prices on investment decisions. We support conclusions of the model by evidence in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. There are policy implications that are derived from the equations of the optimal investment.

40|$|AbstractThe new {{fabrication}} {{method to}} fabricate porous aluminum alloys with aligned unidirectional pores {{was invented by}} dipping pipes into semi-solid slurry. Pure aluminum pipes were dipped into Al- 4 mass% Cu liquid and semi-solid slurry of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> in an electric furnace. The <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and dipped pipes were cooled and solidified together in the air. The pipes were bonded to the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and the original shape of the pipes was maintained by using the semi-solid slurry of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> However, pipes are usually ruptured and buried in the liquid <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> during the process. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} avoid the rupturing of pipes by using the semi-solid slurry because thermal damage of pipes can be reduced by an increase in solid fraction of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The analysis results of Electron Probe MicroAnalyser showed that Cu diffused into grain boundaries of pipes, which decreased the melting temperature of surface of pipes. As a result, the α phase melted partly and then the pipes were bonded with the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> metallurgically. This dipping method can fabricate porous Al-Cu alloys with aligned unidirectional pores with porosity of 33 % when nineteen pipes are used...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlane {{bending fatigue}} tests were {{conducted}} using DLC-coated magnesium alloy AZ 61 with two different film elastic moduli in order to investigate the effect of film elastic modulus on fatigue behaviour. Fatigue strength was improved by DLC film where DLC film with larger elastic modulus was more effective to improve fatigue strength. Delaminations of DLC film from <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> were observed near crack initiation sites. The number of small cracks and delaminations was larger as film elastic moduluswas larger. By DLC film, stress near the boundary between <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film is redistributed in a specimen compared with parent material without DLC film. Stress is reduced at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> but large stress occurs at DLC film due to the differenceof elastic moduli of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film. Stress at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film near the boundary is calculated by FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis. FEM analysis showed that stress decreases at <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> stress increases at DLC film and that the difference of stresses at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film becomes larger when film elastic modulus is larger. It is considered that firmrestraint of slip deformation in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> by DLC film is effective to improve fatigue strength and that large stress in DLC film would not give negative effect on fatigue strength...|$|R

In this study we {{make use of the}} same principle to study the effect of potential and pH on the dissolution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides in a sulphate medium (sulphuric acid) at high temperatures (80 °C). This technique was developed to preferentially liberate a particular <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> from a complex ore. In this way, existing <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphide extraction processes, especially where other unwanted <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides are present, can be optimised so as to yield substantial savings in operating costs. An oxidizing sulphuric acid leach at high temperatures will destroy pyrrhotite, uraninite, labile <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> sulphides (chalcopyrite, sphalerite, orpiment, marcasite), and to a lesser degree pyrite and arsenopyrite.
