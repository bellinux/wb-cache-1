Three experiments were carried out to study different organic feeding regimes in weaned piglets and fattening pigs. In Experiment 1, we evaluated the use of peas and faba beans (0, 120, or 240 g kg- 1) in diets for weaned piglets. Piglets fed pea diets performed {{as well as those}} fed the control diet, whereas the highest faba bean level resulted in reduced feed intake and growth performance. In Experiment 2, we studied the replacement (0, 33, or 67 %) of rapeseed cake with <b>blue</b> <b>lupins</b> in fattening pig diets. The dietary lupin level had a quadratic effect on the weight gain of growing pigs, the best performance being observed at the 33 % replacement level. However, dietary lupin level did not influence weight gain during the finishing period and total fattening. Back fat became softer with increasing dietary lupin levels. In Experiment 3, different protein supplements were compared in organic diets from weaning to slaughter. In two-phase feeding, the best performance was observed when whey protein was used as the protein supplement, followed by soya bean cake + whey protein and rapeseed cake + fish meal. The effects of a one-phase organic feeding regime with cold-pressed rapeseed cake + whey protein did not differ from those of the two-phase organic feeding regimes. Fattening pigs fed organic diets required from two to seven days longer to reach slaughter weight than those fed conventional diets. Pigs fed organic diets had fatter carcasses, but the eating quality of organic pork did not differ from that of pork from pigs fed conventional diets. Feed costs and the circulation rate of pigs, weaners in particular, were greater and carcass prices lower in the organic feeding regimes than in the conventional ones. ...|$|R

A branching variety (cv. Bordako) and a single-stemmed variety (cv. Borweta) were sown in spring. The crops were harvested for whole-crop silage at growth stage 4. 5 (green pod, septa split). Following a 24 h wilt and inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum) application the forage was ensiled in 10 kg mini-silos for 90 days. The moist grain was harvested when the crop reached a target grain DM of 700 g kg? 1. After crimping an acid additive was applied, and the grain ensiled in 10 kg mini-silos. The dry grain was harvested when the DM content of the grain had reached 850 g kg? 1. The chemical composition of the whole-crop silages was similar, with CP concentrations of over 190 g kg? 1 DM. However, the forage yield of Bordako (8446 kg DM ha? 1) {{was significantly higher than}} that of Borweta (6622 kg DM ha? 1). In contrast, the yields of moist and dry grain were higher for Borweta due to lodging of the Bordako stand (3666 kg DM ha? 1 versus 1707 kg DM ha? 1 and 2863 kg DM ha? 1 versus 1442 kg DM ha? 1 for moist and dry grain, respectively). The CP concentrations of the moist and dry grain produced by Bordako (both 360 g kg? 1 DM) were significantly higher than that produced by Borweta (300 g kg? 1 DM).

Aim {{of the study was}} to design a cropping system that can increase overall crop production and provide food, feed, energy and non-market ecosystem services such as increase annual carbon input and reduce leaching loss of nitrogen in the soil. With these ideas a field experiment was conducted in 2014 - 15 in Dybäck, southern part of Sweden. Rye was planted as first crop in September 2014 and harvested in green condition for energy production at the end of May, 2015. <b>Blue</b> <b>lupin,</b> soybean, black bean, lentil and buckwheat were selected as second crops and were grown in between June to September, 2015. It was an interdisciplinary research work. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for this study. A literature search was conducted to collect preliminary data to assess sustainability of double cropping system using Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems (SAFA) as a concept. Quantitative method was used for determining crop yield and crop residues. Qualitative method was used to investigate possible motives and constraints that might influence farmers’ decision to adopt double cropping system through semi-structured interviews. According to the literatures reviewed, conventional double cropping system requires a high level of water consumption and fertilizer utilization. This system also emits a high quantity of GHG. However, due to high soil coverage the system may enhance soil quality and protects soil from land degradation. Double cropping system also supports a large number of diverse species such as beetles and spiders. Increase yield could result in rise in net income. It should be noted that overall outcome of the double cropping system can greatly vary depending on the country/region, climate, soil, choice of the crops/varieties and, cultivation system (irrigated/non-irrigated, tillage/non- tillage, organic/conventional). Grain yield of lentil was highest (1. 7 t/ha) among all the crops. Grain yield of buckwheat, black bean, soybean and <b>blue</b> <b>lupin</b> were 1. 3 t/ha, 0. 9 t/ha, 0. 6 t/ha and 0. 5 t/ha respectively.

Annual C input in the soil by lentil, <b>blue</b> <b>lupin,</b> black bean and soybean were 214. 5 kg/ha, 121. 7 kg/ha, 107. 7 kg/ha and 101. 2 kg/ha respectively.

Red clover (T. pratense) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) germinated well but did not survive periods of moisture stress. White lupin (Lupinus angustifolius cv. Uniwhite) and <b>blue</b> <b>lupin</b> (L. digitatus cv. Boree Blue) exhibited excellent potential but were susceptible to removal by grazing in early growth stages. Aspects of revegetation techniques which require further investigation are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{groups of}} {{organically}} fed hens were studied for egg production, feed parameters, and egg quality from 20 to 31 wk of age. Treatments were 3 diets (0, 15, and 25 % <b>blue</b> <b>lupin)</b> {{with or without}} supplements of foraging material (whole carrots and corn silage). In-creased lupin content increased nonstarch polysaccha-rides content and reduced methionine content below the hens ’ requirement. Egg production at 31 wk was lower with the 25 % lupin diet without (69 %) and with foraging material (76 %) compared with the other diets (∼ 90 %). Egg weight was highest with the 0 % lupin diet (64 g), and 15 % lupin diet (60 g), whereas the 25 % lupin diet without and with foraging material resulted in egg weights of 58 and 56 g, respectively. Feed intakes were ∼ 113 g of diet/ hen per d and 113 g of supplement/hen per d in 0 an...|$|E
40|$|Blue lupins {{have become}} more {{important}} in animal feeding due to increasing organic animal husbandry. The high protein content of blue lupins shows the best protein quality of the home-grown grain legumes combined with low starch content. The feed quality of blue lupins can be analysed very quickly and cost-effi ciently with NIRS. Weed infestation in pure stands of <b>blue</b> <b>lupin</b> is often a problem. Mixed cropping systems are a good alternative for weed suppression, but the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cultivation is low. Weed infestation can be reduced by hoeing. For this, blue lupins were cultivated in wider row distances (25. 0 cm, 37. 5 cm) {{with the possibility of}} hoeing, and compared with the cultivation to 12. 5 cm row distance (only harrowing). Field experiments were conducted in the years 2006 to 2008 in combination with two different cultivars [Boruta (determined type), Bora (branched type) ] and two seed densities (normal: 100...|$|E
40|$|Ploughless {{cropping}} systems {{are becoming increasingly}} important in organic farming. The crop rotation trial in Güterfelde, Brandenburg, shows the long-term effects they have on weed infestation. Ploughless farming was practiced on a crop rotation system comprising of seven fields {{for a period of}} 16 years, with disc harrows and chisel cultivators being used instead. The assessment in spring before silage maize showed that, in comparison with farming systems using ploughs, long-term no-till farming increased the level of monocotyledonous weeds by a factor of 5. 9 and the level of dicotyledonous weeds by a factor of 1. 6. The total weed coverage ratio increased by a factor of 4. 7. Weed cover also increased by a factor of 5 in the non-competitive lupin population following long-term ploughless farming. The problem grass weed is Apera spica-venti. The number of silky bent grass panicles has increased in relation to the competitive ability of crop plant: For example by the factor of 1. 9 in winter rye and 12, 4 in winter triticale. Apera spica-venti dominated the <b>blue</b> <b>lupin</b> population due to ploughless farming. Organic farms need to counteract the significantly higher degree of weed infestation following long-term ploughless farming by using situable multiannual rotation systems combined with more intensive weed control. There is still a problem in managing the strong infestation by Apera spica-venti with ploughless farming for a long time...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} in Brazil is {{a concern}} due to intensive agricultural production. Combining conservation practice, such as no-tillage, with winter cover crops may increase microbial activity and enhance soil quality more than either practice alone. This research evaluated the benefits of long-term (23 years) winter cover crops and reduced tillage on soil microbial quality indicators in an Oxisol from Paraná State, Southern Brazil. The winter cover treatments were: fallow, black oat, wheat, radish, <b>blue</b> <b>lupin,</b> and hairy vetch in conventional (plow) or no-tillage management; the summer crop was a soybean/maize rotation. Soil quality parameters included organic C, microbial biomass C and N, total and labile polysaccharide, easily extractable and total glomalin-related soil protein, and enzyme activity. Winter crops increased soil microbial quality parameters compared to fallow in both tillage systems, with greater relative increase in conventional than no-tillage. No-tillage had higher microbial biomass, polysaccharide, glomalin-related soil protein, and soil enzyme activity than conventional tillage. Including legumes in the crop rotation was important for N balance in the soil–plant system, increasing soil organic C content, and enhancing soil quality parameters {{to a greater extent}} than grasses or radish. The microbial parameters proved to be more sensitive indicators of soil change than soil organic C. Cultivating winter cover crop with either tillage is a beneficial practice enhancing soil microbial quality and also soil organic C stocks...|$|E
40|$|White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is {{an ancient}} {{traditional}} multipurpose crop in Ethiopia. However, its use as livestock feed and human food is limited due to its relatively high alkaloid content. With the objective of finding an alternative, low alkaloid annual lupin, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the adaptability and productivity of sweet lupins in four lupin growing locations of Ethiopia. Fourteen sweet lupin cultivars and two bitter cultivars including the Local Landrace (from white, blue and yellow lupin species) were tested in a randomized complete block design with three replications in the summer 2009. Except with yellow entry at Kossober- 1 location, the Local Landrace either had similar (P ≥ 0. 0513) or significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 0316) forage yield than white, yellow and blue entries in the other three locations. Compared to blue and white group yellow lupin had higher (P ≤ 0. 0316) forage yield at Kossober- 1 but had similar (P ≥ 0. 3635) forage yield in the other three locations. Compared to white group and yellow cultivar, blue cultivars had significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 0350) seed yield across all locations. In terms of seed yield at Finoteselam the local cultivar out yielded (P ≤ 0. 0008) all the sweet lupin groups. This study showed {{that there is a}} high potential to cultivate sweet annual lupins in the traditional lupin growing areas of Ethiopia. Sweet <b>blue</b> <b>lupin</b> cultivars can better adapt in both mi...|$|E
