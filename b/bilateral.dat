5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace.

25|$|PET {{studies have}} {{revealed}} a language modality-specific working memory neural region for sign language (which {{relies on a}} network of <b>bilateral</b> temporal, <b>bilateral</b> parietal, and left premotor activation), {{as well as a}} difference in activation of the right cerebellum in bimodal bilinguals between when they are signing or speaking. Similarities of activation have been found in Broca's area and semantic retrieval causes similar patterns of activation in the anterior left inferior frontal lobe. The <b>bilateral</b> parietal activation pattern for sign language is similar to neural activity during nonverbal visuospatial tasks.|$|E

25|$|The {{body and}} pin meet at either a spring or hinge. The {{earliest}} design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or <b>bilateral.</b> A unilateral spring winds around {{in one direction}} only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. <b>Bilateral</b> springs that wind around to {{both sides of the}} fibula body, appeared around the 6th century BC. <b>Bilateral</b> springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10cm long. Most <b>bilateral</b> springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending {{from one end of the}} spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. <b>Bilateral</b> springs wrap around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.|$|E
