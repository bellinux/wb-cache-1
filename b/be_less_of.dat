Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids.

Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E

25|$|In general, sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be attributed}} to greater intraspecific competition in one sex, either between rivals for access to mates and/or to be chosen by mates. This may stem from the other gender being constrained by providing greater parental investment, in terms of factors such as gamete production, gestation, lactation, or upbringing of young. Although there is much variation in species, generally the more physically aggressive sex is the male, particularly in mammals. In species where parental care by both sexes is required, there tends to <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a difference. When the female can leave the male to care for the offspring, then females may be the larger and more physically aggressive. Competitiveness despite parental investment has also been observed in some species. A related factor is the rate at which males and females are able to mate again after producing offspring, and the basic principles of sexual selection are also influenced by ecological factors affecting the ways or extent to which one sex can compete for the other. The role of such factors in human evolution is controversial.|$|E
500|$|Laurent Gbagbo gained {{recognition}} {{as one of}} the principal instigators of the student demonstrations during the protests against Houphouët-Boigny's government on 9 February 1982, which led to the closing of the universities and other educational institutions. Shortly thereafter, his wife and he formed what would become the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). Gbagbo went into exile in France later that year, where he promoted the FPI and its political platforms. Although the FPI was ideologically similar to the Unified Socialist Party, the French socialist government tried to ignore Gbagbo's party to please Houphouët-Boigny. After a lengthy appeal process, Gbagbo obtained status as a political refugee in France in 1985. However, the French government attempted to pressure him into returning to Côte d'Ivoire, as Houphouët-Boigny had begun to worry about Gbagbo's developing a network of contacts, and believed [...] "his stirring opponent would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a threat in Abidjan than in Paris".|$|E
500|$|The Wanderers players {{began the}} game in {{relative}} disarray, which the correspondent from The Sportsman reported was not an uncommon feature of their matches. [...] After fifteen minutes Oxford were awarded a corner kick, which Evelyn Waddington kicked high towards the goal. [...] Kinnaird caught the ball, but in doing so stepped behind the goal-line. [...] The Oxford players immediately appealed for a goal to be awarded, and after a consultation the officials did so, giving the University team the lead. [...] Some time later, Charles Wollaston was injured and swapped positions with Kinnaird. [...] At the time the concept of substitution had not been introduced to the sport, so injured players were obliged {{to remain in the}} game unless they were completely unable to play on, but it was common for an injured player to [...] "retire into goal", where it was felt he would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a liability.|$|E

He completed both a Bachelor's degree and a Master's qualification in science, securing Honours in both mathematics and physics, finishing his studies in 1937. Despite these achievements, he did not consider himself to be practically trained, saying: [...] "I was still very much a theorist, with no practical physics at all.

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Jonah Bromwich {{analyzed}} {{that the}} beginning half of Star Wars Headspace {{consists of the}} producers sampling from the movie while making music in their common style, making it feel like [...] "obvious tribute material". The first track, Kaskade's [...] "C-3P0's Plight", represents Star Wars humor and C-3PO's melodramatic character aspect, featuring sounds of Wookiee's roar and shots from a Blaster weapon. Rubin's Trap remix of [...] "Jabba Flow", a composition by J.J. Abrams and Lin-Manuel Miranda used in , is the fifth track on the compilation, which is followed by Claude VonStroke's [...] "R2 Knows", featuring vocals from Barry Drift and described in a review by Pitchfork Media as a silly anthem similar to releases from Todd Terje. Another track by Rubin, [...] "NR-G7", has many samples such as R2-D2 blips playing over a [...] "driving" [...] four on the floor instrumental with [...] "dazzling jet-stream" [...] synthesizers. However, [...] Bromwich also wrote that the later songs on the track list focus less on the artists making music in their typical trend and more on replicating what made John Williams score so great. Consequence of Sounds Derek Staples noted Norwegian duo Röyksopp's “Bounty Hunters” to <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a bright song {{and more of a}} dark synthwave track than their usual material. [...] "Sunset Over Manaan" [...] by Attlas, a producer signed under the label mau5trap, has a melody reminiscent of [...] "Leia's Theme", and has a more [...] "cinematic" [...] atmosphere than his previous work. The record closes with 	"Star Tripper" [...] by French producer Breakbot, a downtempo funk song featuring orchestration reflecting the neo-romantic aspect of Williams' soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Driving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a {{young girl}} walking towards them, and signalled Hindley to stop, which she did not do until she had passed the girl. Brady drew up {{alongside}} on his motorbike, demanding to know why she had not offered the girl a lift, to which Hindley replied that she recognised her as Marie Ruck, a near neighbour of her mother. Shortly after 8:00pm, continuing down Froxmer Street, Brady spotted a girl wearing a pale blue coat and white high-heeled shoes walking away from them, and once again signalled for the van to stop. Hindley recognised the girl as Pauline Reade, a friend of her younger sister, Maureen. Reade got into the van with Hindley, who then asked if she would mind helping to search for an expensive glove she had lost on Saddleworth Moor. Reade said she was in no great hurry, and agreed. At 16, Pauline Reade was older than Marie Ruck, and Hindley believed that there would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> an outcry over the disappearance of a teenager than there would over a child of seven or eight. When the van reached the moor, Hindley stopped and Brady arrived shortly afterwards on his motorcycle. She introduced him to Reade as her boyfriend, {{and said that he}} had also come to help find the missing glove. Hindley claimed Brady took Reade onto the moor while Hindley waited in the van. After about 30minutes Brady returned alone, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying. Her throat had been cut twice with a large knife. The larger of these wounds was a four-inch incision across her voice box, and the collar of Reade's coat had been deliberately pushed into this wound. He told her to stay with Reade while he fetched a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit to the moor, to bury the body. Hindley noticed that [...] "Pauline's coat was undone and her clothes were in disarray... She had guessed from the time he had taken that Brady had sexually assaulted her." [...] Brady's account differed from Hindley's. He claimed that Hindley was not only there at the scene, but that she assisted him with the sexual assault on Pauline. Returning home from the moor in the van—they had loaded the motorcycle into the back—Brady and Hindley passed Reade's mother, Joan, accompanied by her son, Paul, searching the streets for Pauline.|$|E
