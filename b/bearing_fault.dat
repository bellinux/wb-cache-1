50|$|There {{is still}} a room for {{discussion}} whether the rolling element excites the natural frequencies of bearing component when it passes the fault on the outer race. Hence we need to identify the bearing outer race natural frequency and its harmonics. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a FFT analysis. The natural frequencies of a rolling element bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3 kHz. Therefore, {{in order to use}} the bearing component resonance bandwidth method to detect the <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> at an initial stage a high frequency range accelerometer should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired. A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the outer race. The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a bearing outer race fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults waveform, spectrum and envelope techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency demodulation is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of resonance, as {{it may or may not}} contain fault frequency components.|$|E
50|$|Using {{spectral}} analysis {{as a tool}} to identify the faults in the bearings faces challenges due to issues like low energy, signal smearing, cyclostationarity etc. High resolution is often desired to differentiate the fault frequency components from the other high-amplitude adjacent frequencies. Hence, when the signal is sampled for FFT analysis, the sample length should be large enough to give adequate frequency resolution in the spectrum. Also, keeping the computation time and memory within limits and avoiding unwanted aliasing may be demanding. However, a minimal frequency resolution required can be obtained by estimating the <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> frequencies and other vibration frequency components and its harmonics due to shaft speed, misalignment, line frequency, gearbox etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method used in signal {{analysis}} is the FFT, or Fourier transform. The Fourier transform and its inverse counterpart offer two perspectives {{to study a}} signal: via the time domain or via the frequency domain. The FFT-based spectrum of a time signal shows us the existence of its frequency contents. By studying these and their magnitude or phase relations, we can obtain various types of information, such as harmonics, sidebands, beat frequency, <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> frequency and so on. However, the FFT is only suitable for signals whose frequency contents do not change over time; however, as mentioned above, the frequency contents of the sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine are very much time-dependent. For this reason, FFT-based spectra are unable to detect how the frequency contents develop over time. To be more specific, if the RPM of a machine is increasing or decreasing during its startup or shutdown period, its bandwidth in the FFT spectrum will become much wider {{than it would be}} simply for the steady state. Hence, in such a case, the harmonics are not so distinguishable in the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCondition {{monitoring}} of electric drives is {{of paramount importance}} since it contributes to enhance the system reliability and availability. Moreover, the knowledge about the fault mode behavior is extremely important in order to improve system protection and fault-tolerant control. Fault detection and diagnosis in squirrel cage induction machines based on motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been widely investigated. Several high resolution spectral estimation techniques have been developed and used to detect induction machine abnormal operating conditions. This paper focuses on the application of MCSA for the detection of abnormal mechanical conditions that may lead to induction machines failure. In fact, this paper is devoted to the detection of single-point defects in bearings based on parametric spectral estimation. A multi-dimensional MUSIC (MD MUSIC) algorithm has been developed for <b>bearing</b> <b>faults</b> detection based on <b>bearing</b> <b>faults</b> characteristic frequencies. This method has been used to estimate the fundamental frequency and the fault related frequency. Then, an amplitude estimator of the fault characteristic frequencies has been proposed and fault indicator has been derived for fault severity measurement.

50|$|Machine fault {{diagnosis}} {{is a field}} of mechanical engineering concerned with finding faults arising in machines. A particularly well developed part of it applies specifically to rotating machinery, {{one of the most}} common types encountered. To identify the most probable faults leading to failure, many methods are used for data collection, including vibration monitoring, thermal imaging, oil particle analysis, etc. Then these data are processed utilizing methods like spectral analysis, wavelet analysis, wavelet transform, short term Fourier transform, Gabor Expansion, Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), cepstrum, bispectrum, correlation method, high resolution spectral analysis, waveform analysis (in the time domain, because spectral analysis usually concerns only frequency distribution and not phase information) and others. The results of this analysis are used in a root cause failure analysis in order to determine the original cause of the fault. For example, if a <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> is diagnosed, then it is likely that the bearing was not itself damaged at installation, but rather as the consequence of another installation error (e.g., misalignment) which then led to bearing damage. Diagnosing the bearing's damaged state is not enough for precision maintenance purposes. The root cause needs to be identified and remedied. If this is not done, the replacement bearing will soon wear out for the same reason and the machine will suffer more damage, remaining dangerous. Of course, the cause may also be visible as a result of the spectral analysis undertaken at the data-collection stage, but this may not always be the case.|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{were made}} into how squared {{envelope}} analysis and Self Adaptive Noise Cancellation (SANC) {{can be used}} to improve the reliability of bearing diagnostics in gearboxes. Present models of <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> signals were improved by incorporating slight random fluctuations into the spacings between <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> impulses. This allowed simulated signals to be used for the investigation of squared envelope analysis and the optimisation of SANC. The values for the three variables which affect the adaptation process of S LṄC are optimised for removing discrete frequency noise from <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> components; this was done by using simulated <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> and gear signals. The recommended values were then applied to enhance the <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> signals recorded from an actual helicopter gearbox. Analysis of the squared envelope can give an improvement in bearing diagnostics if the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than unity. The MSR (Mean Squared Ratio) of signal to noise in the demodulation band and the percentage fluctuation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>fault</b> impulses were found to influence this factor and their values determined for a SNR of unity.
