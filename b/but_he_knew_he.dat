60|$|Philip {{said all}} this to himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could not do it. He simply could not. He knew himself.|$|E
6000|$|This was unexpected. More than that, it was wonderful; for {{the field}} seemed bare of even a stump. Jim's eyes grew big with amazement, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had caught {{something}} when a voice cried out: ...|$|E
60|$|His {{brother-in-law}} {{paused in}} the middle of an expatiation on the business opportunities of the neighborhood. He hadn't said how much it would cost. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> had figured it out a score of times.|$|E
50|$|Colville {{is getting}} used to the comfort of Palazzo Pinti <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> must leave before he gets too {{accustomed}} to the hospitality. He loves being at the Palazzo Pinti with Mrs. Bowen and Effie <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> must go back to the hotel.|$|R
5000|$|One {{episode of}} Supermarket Sweep from 1991 {{featured}} Johnny Gilbert mentioning during the Big Sweep {{to a team}} member named Barry (who also appeared on Monopoly): [...] "He thinks he's on Candid Camera, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> on Supermarket Sweep!".|$|R
5000|$|Kirk has any normal man's insecurities and doubts, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> cannot ever {{show them}} — except {{occasionally}} in private with ship's surgeon McCoy or in subsequent moments with Mr. Spock whose opinions Kirk {{has learned to}} value so highly.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could not. A woman, he {{must have}} a woman. And having a woman, he must be free of her. It {{would be the same}} position. For he could not be free of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I can't make it," [...] he told himself, as he panted for breath. He was so {{exhausted}} {{that he felt}} very much like fainting away. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> must keep his senses, or all would be over with him.|$|E
6000|$|Bartley {{did not ask}} {{her what}} her letter was when she demanded a stamp of him on his return; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> inquired of Mrs. Nash where these cheap eating-houses were to be found, and he posted the letter in the first box they came to, merely saying, [...] "I hope you haven't been asking any favors, Marsh?" ...|$|E
50|$|Tom’s strong {{feelings}} for Masha have left him unable {{to distinguish between}} reality and fantasy. Like his character in the opera, Tom wonders if he is being tested for a higher purpose <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> must play out his role in Masha’s story until the final curtain.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Navy sailor Alex Winkley (Bill Williams) {{wakes up}} from a night of {{drinking}} in New York City and finds he has a wad of cash. His memory is hazy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> got it from a woman he had visited earlier in the evening, Edna Bartelli (Lola Lane).|$|R
50|$|Logan awakens on Earth-616 in New York City. He is {{not sure}} how he has been relocated, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> is in the past. He decides to prevent his post-apocalyptic future. His first target is a minor villain Black Butcher who in his future stole Scotty Logan's {{baseball}} cap. Logan easily kills him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me a kiss," [...] she said, like a tired child. It was {{not like}} the shy embrace with which they had {{sometimes}} met and parted, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> must not rouse her, and only said very low, [...] "Good night, my poor dear; God bless you, and grant us a happy meeting, whenever it is." ...|$|E
60|$|With bowed {{head and}} slow, {{dragging}} steps {{he made his}} way westward. The land was strange to him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going toward familiar ground. For a time he walked quietly, all the time the fierce fever in his veins slowly abating. Calm he always was, except when that unnatural lust for Indians' blood overcame him.|$|E
60|$|Rob cared {{little for}} the quarrel between the Turks and Tatars, and under {{ordinary}} circumstances would {{have refused to}} side with one or the other; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could not hope to recover his electrical machines unless the city {{was taken by the}} band of warriors who had befriended him, so he determined to force an entrance for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> {{not because}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was my husband, <b>but</b> because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> bore the same name. He thinks, as every one does, {{that my husband}} died in San Francisco. The man who died there was my husband's cousin--a desperate man and a noted duelist." ...|$|R
50|$|Rocky Marshall plays Ed Keating, a cardiothoracic {{registrar}} {{who appears}} from series four, episode 45 until series six, episode 33, working under Tom Campbell-Gore. Ed leaves when he realises {{he has been}} set up by Tom Campbell-Gore after an operation goes bad and an investigation is made requiring blame. <b>He</b> is cleared <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> can't work with Tom anymore.|$|R
50|$|Today, Franzen has mixed {{feelings}} about his recently acquired ‘freedom.’ He admitted before {{a small group of}} press people, that yes, he’s happy to see his wife Love Joy and little son Franzen Juan again. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> also nixed his chance to win the big cache waiting for the housemate who will survive all evictions on Dec. 10.|$|R
60|$|Breakfast {{was over}} and, {{although}} Jimmy {{would have liked}} another bannock, {{he got up and}} strapped on his pack. Deering needed the bannock, for flour was running out. A fire burned on the stone hearth and the little shack {{in a corner of the}} rocks was warm. Jimmy did not want to leave it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> must, and the Indian waited for him to start.|$|E
60|$|The {{very next}} evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody {{to buy the}} dress, {{determined}} to get the worst over and have done with it. It would be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{would be at the}} mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress.|$|E
60|$|She {{was looking}} {{straight}} at him, {{and her eyes}} did not drop, but they looked still more wistful. Tommy {{did not understand the}} courage that made her say what she had said, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was hurting her; he knew that if she was too plain-spoken it was out of loyalty, and that to wound Grizel because she had to speak her mind was a shame--yes, he always knew that.|$|E
60|$|How long he sat, {{drinking}} and brooding, and being dragged in imagination hither and thither, {{no one could}} have told less correctly than <b>he.</b> <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> had been sitting a long time by candle-light, when he started up and listened, in a sudden terror.|$|R
50|$|After a chase through snow-covered mountains, Septime decoys {{the kidnappers}} {{into the hands}} of the police. Free and back in Paris, he is {{abducted}} and flown to the Mediterranean coast. In a beautiful garden he meets Novalès, who arranged his own abduction in order to have a holiday. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> will have to go back to his duties and, returning to Paris, gives Septime the credit for finding him.|$|R
50|$|Jake wakes to see {{his father}} and learns {{that because of the}} cave-in, the {{patients}} were able to escape. He also survives without much injury other than a few bruises. He's considered a hero, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> isn't one, and so he decides to make the difficult decision to write the truth in the article, concluding that the line between courage and cowardice is much thinner than he'd thought.|$|R
60|$|Making no answer, Prescott left them; {{and he was}} {{harnessing}} {{his horse}} outside when, somewhat to his astonishment, Muriel came toward him. A half-moon hung low above the bluff and the silvery light shone into her face, showing her warmth of color and the sparkle in her eyes. He thought she looked wonderfully attractive and his heart throbbed faster, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> must hold himself in hand.|$|E
6000|$|It was the Prioress's voice! He felt a jolt as of a waggon, {{and opened}} his eyes. It was dark, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was under the tilt of Lorimer's waggon, which was moving on. The Prioress was {{kneeling}} over him on one side, Lorimer on the other, and his head was on a soft lap--nay, a warm tear dropped on his face, a sweet though stifled voice said, 'Is he truly better?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{would never}} be able to do it. He was afraid that Rose would sneer at him. He was angry with himself, and when Sharp came in a little while {{afterwards}} he seized upon the first opportunity to quarrel with him. Philip had a fiendish instinct for discovering other people's raw spots, and was able to say things that rankled because they were true. But Sharp had the last word.|$|E
6000|$|... "'No campingers allowed,'" [...] {{read the}} doctor's son. [...] "His {{spelling}} and grammar {{are not very}} strong <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what <b>he</b> means." ...|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{describes}} {{that his}} life may be bad sometimes, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>he's</b> still blessed and that God must really love him.|$|R
60|$|All this {{sounded very}} mysterious to Tom Pinch. <b>But</b> as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could rely upon his friend, he {{resolved}} {{to follow this}} advice.|$|R
60|$|Then Lister's foot {{slipped and}} he could get no hold for his hands. His smooth boots drew a greasy line across the wet slab as he slid down. Perhaps the risk was not very daunting, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> must not roll down far. At {{the bottom of the}} slab he brought up with his foot braced against a knob, and he saw Barbara coming after him. When she stopped her glance was apologetic.|$|E
60|$|Venters {{watched her}} in joy too deep for words. By it he divined {{something}} of what Lassiter's revelation meant to Bess, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could only faintly understand. That {{moment when she}} seemed to be lifted by some spiritual transfiguration was the most beautiful moment of his life. She stood with parted, quivering lips, with hands tightly clasping the locket to her heaving breast. A new conscious pride of worth dignified the old wild, free grace and poise.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jordan gave {{a little}} grunt, not unamiable. Paul divined that his master's bark was worse than his bite. Indeed, the little manufacturer, {{although}} he spoke bad English, was quite gentleman enough to leave his men alone and to take no notice of trifles. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{did not look like}} the boss and owner of the show, so he had to play his role of proprietor at first, to put things on a right footing.|$|E
5000|$|Looking at the {{character}} in retrospect at MuppetFest, {{he recalled that}} [...] "over the years, he sort of evolved along with me... I was an impostor in show business. In the first season, Gonzo is always self-effacing and embarrassed. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> has something special." [...] Adding to Goelz' insecurity was the jaded veteran crew members of ATV Studios, {{who had worked with}} the likes of Julie Andrews and Bing Crosby, and were thus hard to impress.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you have}} some common sense after all, {{which is more than}} Ulick {{attributes}} to his kith and kin. When I had proved the respectability of banking to his conviction, I'll not say satisfaction, he made me promise to write to his father. He is making up his mind to what is not only a great vexation to himself, and very irksome employment, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> shall be looked down upon as having lost caste with all his family!' ...|$|R
50|$|Sergio (Horacio Pancheri) and Daniel (Cristián de la Fuente), are Aníbal's brothers. Immediately, both feel {{a strong}} {{attraction}} for Isabel. Sergio {{is a quiet}} and sensible man, working as a doctor and always willing {{to take care of}} Isabel's health. On the other hand, Daniel is a handsome and nature-loving man; he is the one with the most freedom from all three. He lives life with intense passion; he falls madly in love with his sister-in-law, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> must renounce this forbidden love.|$|R
