5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's <b>base</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of Mt.

Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson.
