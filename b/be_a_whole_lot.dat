500|$|Reviewers {{thought the}} {{expansion}} {{would be worth}} the player's investment if they enjoyed Fallout 4. Kirk McKeand (Eurogamer) said there are no real choices to make in Nuka-World, though it still may be worthy of your time. Kat Bailey (USgamer) liked the expansion, and {{thought there was a}} lot to do in it, but not all of it is interesting. She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better", but if you enjoyed Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph {{stated that}} [...] "Wolverine is an {{artificial}} stimulus package {{of the most}} unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there’s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned." [...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything {{we need to know}} from the films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting." [...] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that [...] "how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> less interesting than what he does with them", while also being [...] "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing".|$|E
2500|$|Driscoll {{returned}} to professional baseball in 1919. In February 1919, {{weeks after his}} starring performance in the Rose Bowl, he was traded by the Cubs to the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. The Angels planned to play Driscoll at shortstop, and the Los Angeles Times opined: [...] "If he can dash around the diamond like he does across the tanbark there won't <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> {{for the remainder of}} the Angel infield to do." [...] He appeared in 39 games for the Angels and compiled a [...]264 batting average and [...]380 slugging percentage with three doubles, four triples, and a home run.|$|E

2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX. Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, there seemed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs {{seem to be doing}} that anymore. We're trying to bring that back a little bit with our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{the union}} hires the lawyers to defend us, though that ain't much good now, for the judges are pretty hostyle, an' the papers keep hammerin' away at {{them to give}} stiffer an' stiffer sentences.

6000|$|... "Riggs! Harve Riggs!" [...] blazed Bo. [...] "The instant I {{recognized}} him I got over my scare. And so mad I burned all through like fire. I don't know what I said, {{but it was}} wild--and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot,</b> you bet.|$|R

"Well, I <b>am</b> not <b>a</b> king," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "and {{if you go to}} arresting me and {{throwing}} me into one of your musty old dungeons you will find that I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> more important than most kings. I'm an American citizen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose so," [...] Carl mused. [...] "The {{rebellion}} against stuffy marriage has to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> wider than some little detail like changing {{from city to}} country. Probably for some people the happiest thing 'd be {{to live in a}} hobohemian flat and have parties, and for some to live in the suburbs and get the missus elected president of the Village Improvement Society. For us, I believe, it's change and keep going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] she protested once more, {{but this}} time he must have known that she only did it for form's sake and really meant to let him have his way. [...] "The {{neighbours}} would see you enter, and there might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of people in the tap-room at that hour: one never knows. They would know by then that my father had gone away and they would talk such scandal about me. My reputation [...] . . ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine work nothing!" [...] groaned Mr. Drum. [...] "If I had my way, there'd <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of violence, and I'd start it, {{and then}} the whole thing would be over. I don't believe in {{standing}} back and wet-nursing these fellows and letting the disturbances drag on. I tell you these strikers are nothing in God's world {{but a lot of}} bomb-throwing socialists and thugs, {{and the only way to}} handle 'em is with a club! That's what I'd do; beat up the whole lot of 'em!" ...|$|E
500|$|As of 2016 {{the group}} are on hiatus, with Leary saying: [...] "I just don't {{want to play}} live anymore. It's not fun, I don't like touring. That hour on stage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of fun, but the other 23 hours off stage just fucking suck." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> frightened," [...] said honest Walter. [...] "But I'm {{not going}} to be frightened any more, sir.

6000|$|... "Oh, I've had my troubles," [...] Billy answered, {{speaking}} in his wonted slow way. [...] "I've had my hard times, an' fought a losin' strike, an' soaked my watch, an' ben {{unable to pay}} my rent or buy grub, an' slugged scabs, an' ben slugged, and ben thrown into jail for makin' a fool of myself. If I get you, I'd <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better to be a swell hog fattenin' for market an' nothin' worryin', than to be a guy sick to his stomach from not savvyin' how the world is made or from wonderin' what's the good of anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|What I {{mean to say}} is, {{you are on the}} map. You have a {{sporting}} chance. Whereas George... Well, just go over to England and try wooing an earl's daughter whom you have only met once--and then without an introduction; whose brother's hat you have smashed beyond repair; whose family wishes her to marry some other man: who wants to marry some other man herself--and not the same other man, but another other man; who is closely immured in a mediaeval castle [...] . Well, all I say is--try it. And then go back to your porch with a chastened spirit and admit that you might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> worse off.|$|E

5000|$|Baby Monkey has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Mojo wrote: [...] "Baby Monkey has a strangely nostalgic feel - as if he's reanimated his old raver's soul, with its favourite beats and bass lines intact."

But that’s {{not the way it}} is, and the lover to whom our narrator speaks is not content with the pace of the affair. He is thus a target for her scorn.|$|E
