40|$|For a {{container}} terminal system, efficient <b>berth</b> and <b>quay</b> crane (QC) schedules have {{great impact on}} the improvement of both operation efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this paper we address <b>berth</b> and <b>quay</b> crane scheduling problems in a simultaneous way, with uncertainties of vessel arrival time and container handling time. The berths are of discrete type and vessels arrive dynamically with different service priorities. QCs are allowed to move to other berths before finishing processing on currently assigned vessels, adding more flexibility to the terminal system. A mixed integer programming model is proposed, and a simulation based Genetic Algorithm (GA) search procedure is applied to generate robust berth and QC schedule proactively.

The major {{difficulties}} of the operation of loading, unloading and transportation at container terminals are how to schedule <b>berths,</b> <b>quay</b> cranes and trucks more effectively and efficiently.

40|$|AbstractBerth as {{infrastructure}} {{in the port}} {{have an important role}} in the operation of container terminals. The performance of terminal to serve the customers is determined by availability of berth and facilities to support of container terminal activities. In the last decade, several research related of these issues had been conducted particularly in the berth allocation problem. Most of the researchers had developed the model base on deterministic assumptions whereas models which are considering variability as uncertainty still rarely. Variability of ship arrival time and handling time are causes the difference between the schedule planned and actual berthing time. These difference reduce berth productivity due loading and unloading time could not predictable. This situation will influence to operational cost for shipping lines and terminal operators. This paper develop a conceptual model of ship-to-berth allocation considering variability of ship arrival and service time. Collaborative strategies is considered as an scenario through asset sharing and joint planning and operation. The objective to develop model are reducing total handling time and improve resources utility such as <b>berth,</b> <b>quay</b> crane, and container yard simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|The Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) is a {{critical}} issue for the efficient operation of a container terminal. While there are many works on berth allocation, most of the BAP models have used the assumption of a deterministic situation where arrival time and number of containers brought by a vessel are known in advance. Such a deterministic assumption, however, never holds true in real life. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how collaboration between berth terminals could affect the port performance when dealing with uncertainty. Given the complexity of the problem, we have used discrete event simulation to model the system. Two major scenarios were evaluated, namely non-collaborative-response and collaborative-response. Collaborative-response is implemented by sharing resources such as <b>berth,</b> <b>quay</b> cranes and container yard among two terminals. The port performance was evaluated based on ship waiting time, container handling time and total ship turnaround time. The results show that collaborative strategy can reduce overall waiting time, container-handling time and total ship turnaround time; however, the impacts on each terminal vary...|$|R

Among the scarcest resources are the berth and its associated cranes. Thus, two important optimization problems arise, which are the <b>berth</b> allocation and <b>quay</b> crane assignment problems. The berth allocation problem deals with the generation of a berth plan, which determines where and when a ship has to <b>berth</b> alongside the <b>quay.</b> The quay crane assignment problem addresses the problem of determining how many and which quay crane(s) will serve each vessel. In this paper, an integrated heuristics-based solution methodology is proposed that tackles both problems simultaneously.

40|$|Due to the {{dramatic}} increase in the world’s container traffic, the efficient management of operations in seaport container terminals has become a crucial issue. In this work, we focus on the integrated planning of the following problems faced at container terminals: <b>berth</b> allocation, <b>quay</b> crane assignment (number), and quay crane assignment (specific). First, we formulate a new binary integer linear program for the integrated solution of the <b>berth</b> allocation and <b>quay</b> crane assignment (number) problems called BACAP. Then we extend it by incorporating the quay crane assignment (specific) problem as well, which is named BACASP. Computational experiments performed on problem instances of various sizes indicate that the model for BA-CAP is very efficient and even large instances up to 60 vessels can be solved to optimality. Unfortunately, {{this is not the case}} for BACASP. Therefore, to be able to solve large instances, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for generating an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP using a post-processing algorithm. In case this condition is not satisfied, we make use of a cutting plane algorithm which solves BACAP repeatedly by adding cuts generated from the optimal solutions until the aforementioned condition holds. This method proves to be viable and enables us to solve large BACASP instances as well. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest instances that can be solved to optimality for this difficult problem, which makes our work applicable to realistic problems...|$|R
