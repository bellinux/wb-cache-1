500|$|The length being {{restored}} {{in the first}} phase is around [...] long, and presents some of the biggest difficulties to restoration in the whole [...] route. Through Dudbridge, the channel has been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the Environment Agency. Water from the Slad Brook, which is culverted beneath Stroud, joins the Thames and Severn Canal a short distance above Lower Wallbridge Lock, the first on that canal, while the Painswick Stream joins above the Dudbridge locks, and the Ruscombe Brook joins between the two locks. The top gates of the locks were replaced with concrete dams, which maintained the water level at normal flows around [...] lower than the navigable levels. Below the A419 Dudbridge Road bridge, the water was discharged into the River Frome. As a consequence of its flood relief function, the channel here is classified as a [...] "main river". Designs for reinstatement of the canal have had to accommodate large flows on this section, and include underground <b>bywash</b> culverts, capable of carrying the full flood flow of all three streams. A new weir which carries a towpath bridge has been constructed where the water leaves the canal to enter the River Frome, and a set of floodgates has been constructed beyond the weir, to protect the canal from high water levels.|$|E

40|$|SIR-Uptake of avirulent T. pallidum (Nichols strain) was {{demonstrated}} in an in vitro system. Motile treponemes were harvested after culture for 7 days in spirolate broth (Izzat, Knox, and Wende, 1971).

40|$|Zircon is {{notoriously}} inert. Aggressive processing {{methods such as}} alkaline fusion are conventionally used to extract zirconium values from the mineral. In this study results are presented with respect to microwave digestion of zircon using ammonium acid fluoride (NH 4 F· 1. 5 HF). Two distinct experimental methods were used. In the first method the reaction was followed in the temperature range of 100 to 200 °C, for a full reaction period of 60 min at each temperature. The secondmethod comprised successive digestion periods interrupted <b>bywashing</b> and re-introduction of fresh acid fluoride at a series of reaction temperatures varying between 120 and 240 °C. Complete digestion was achieved with the latter technique. The kinetics is shown {{to be controlled by}} product-layer diffusion. The two data sets were combined to derive consistent temperature-dependent kinetic parameters. A facile numerical technique for extracting these parameters from the experimental data is used.

50|$|The Stalybridge {{substation}} {{was built}} while the canal {{was closed to}} navigation, encroaching on the former canal line, and the canal was culverted at this point {{from the head of}} Lock 8W to a point immediately downstream of the substation. The extent of the former culvert can still be seen, as it was reused to form the lock <b>bywash.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first lumbering on {{the south}} side of the Kim River near Ottawa was by Braddish Billings, a former {{employee}} of Philemon Wright, with William M?? where they cut timber in Gloucester Township in 1810.The industry began in Bytown with St. Louis, who in 1830 used the <b>bywash</b> (a section, that no longer exists, of the early Rideau Canal which drained into the Rideau River) near Cumberland and York. In 2001 he moved to Rideau Falls. Thomas McKay acquired the mill in 1837.|$|E
50|$|A lock pound {{lies between}} two locks which {{are only a}} short {{distance}} apart. Water levels in the pound are liable to fluctuate as the locks are used. Boats entering the pound from the lower level remove a lockful {{of water from the}} pound, while those using the upper lock add a lockful of water. Because the maximum level in the pound is normally controlled by a <b>bywash</b> weir at the lower lock, some of the water from the upper lock may be lost over it, and if the lower lock has a deeper fall, there is a net loss of level when a boat passes through the pound.|$|E
50|$|The {{necessary}} {{funding to}} restore the lock at Wansford was secured in mid 2008 and work commenced later the same year. The first priority {{was the creation of}} a flood relief channel (<b>bywash)</b> around {{the south side of the}} lock to carry the excess flow during periods of heavy rain. This work was completed in autumn 2008. The final stages of the restoration were completed during spring and early summer of 2009. The new gates were installed during April and May and considerable restoration work was carried out on the north wall of the lock chamber. The stop planks were removed and the lock was commissioned on 30 May 2009, with the first boat in over 60 years entering the lock.|$|E
50|$|The Enoggera Dam, the Gold Creek Dam and the Mount Crosby Weir {{were built}} to supply water to Brisbane {{but could not}} meet growing demand. A site 2.8 km {{upstream}} from the creek's confluence with the Brisbane River was selected as this was the next catchment to {{the west in the}} D'Aguilar Range. The designer was Allan Hazen, an American engineer. Construction of the Lake Manchester Dam commenced in 1912 and when it was completed in 1916, it was the fourtholdest dam in Queensland and was originally called the Cabbage Tree Creek Dam. The dam was renamed in 1916 in honour of E. J. T. Manchester, the president of the Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. In 1924 the elevation of the <b>bywash</b> was raised which added to the dams capacity.|$|E
50|$|In 1810, William Jones and his {{business}} partner Ira Schofield, started construction on a new mill, a 3 1/2 storey, Georgian architecture style, stone mill, using an automated mill design by American inventor Oliver Evans. The mill was located on bedrock, north of Stevens' original mill, and the creek from the Lower Beverley lakes was diverted to this new mill. Abel Stevens' dam likely raised {{the water in the}} original lower Upper Beverley Lake by about 4 to 5 feet (based on the appearance of the two Upper Beverley lakes on Grant's 1797 survey map of Bastard Township), the new stone mill, which acted in part as its own dam, with an adjacent <b>bywash,</b> raised the water level by about 9 feet (+/-), forming one lake where there had originally been two.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} species of lamprey in the UK; the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and the brook lamprey Lampetra planeri. All three {{are found in}} the River Tay. They are all {{included}} in Annex II of the European Habitats Directive 92 / 43 /EEC and are designated species in the River Tay SAC. Stanley Mills is a small scale run-of-river hydro-electric power station which takes water from the River Tay, upstream of Perth. This project aimed {{to assess the impact of}} Stanley Mills power station on downstream-migrating lamprey. Sea and river lamprey are typically anadromous species. They spawn in fresh water where the ammocoetes (larvae) remain for several years before transforming into parasitic adults and migrating to the sea. The concern is that downstream migrating lamprey may travel into the water intake for the hydropower station and either become impinged on trash screens or damaged by passing through the turbine itself. Sampling was carried out through the main expected period of emigration (September to March). Debris from the trash screen was checked for lamprey. Nets were set in the outflow from the power station while the turbine was both running and turned off to catch lamprey which had passed through the turbines or the <b>bywash.</b> All lamprey were identified, measured and their condition assesse...|$|E
