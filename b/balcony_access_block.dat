40|$|Emergency {{department}} <b>access</b> <b>block</b> is {{an urgent}} problem faced by many public hospitals today. When <b>access</b> <b>block</b> occurs, patients {{in need of}} acute care cannot access inpatient wards within an optimal time frame. A widely held belief is that <b>access</b> <b>block</b> is the end product of a long causal chain, which involves poor discharge planning, insufficient bed capacity, and inadequate admission intensity to the wards. This paper studies the last link of the causal chainthe effect of admission intensity on <b>access</b> <b>block,</b> using data from a metropolitan hospital in Australia. We applied several modern statistical methods to analyze the data. First, we modeled the admission events as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process and estimated time-varying admission intensity with penalized regression splines. Next, we established a functional linear model to investigate {{the effect of the}} time-varying admission intensity on emergency department <b>access</b> <b>block.</b> Finally, we used functional principal component analysis to explore the variation in the daily time-varying admission intensities. The analyses suggest that improving admission practice during off-peak hours may have most impact on reducing the number of ED <b>access</b> <b>blocks.</b> Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|There is pessimism {{regarding}} {{the ability of}} the Acute Health Sector to manage <b>access</b> <b>block</b> for emergency and elective patients. Melbourne Health suffered an acute bed crisis in 2001 resulting in record ambulance diversions and emergency department (ED) delays. We conducted an observational study to reduce <b>access</b> <b>block</b> for emergency patients whilst maintaining elective throughput at Melbourne Health. This involved a clinician-led taskforce using previously proven principles for organisational change to implement 51 actions to improve patient access over a three- month period. The primary outcome measures were ambulance diversion, emergency patients waiting more than 12 hours for an inpatient bed, elective throughput and theatre cancellations. Despite a reduction in multi-day bed numbers all primary objectives were met, ambulance diversion decreased to minimal levels, 12 -hour waits decreased by 40 % and elective throughput was maintained. Theatre cancellations were also minimised. We conclude that <b>access</b> <b>block</b> can be improved by clinician-led implementation of proven process improvements over a short time frame. The ability to sustain change over the longer term requires further study. <b>Access</b> <b>block</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Block</b> for emergency and elective patients to inpatient beds is becoming an increasing problem both i...|$|R
40|$|Background: Emergency Department (ED) {{overcrowding}} {{occurs when}} the need for ED services outstrips available resources. Causes have been divided into input, throughput, and output factors, of which the last {{appear to be the}} most influential. Unavailability of inpatient beds (so-called “access block,” or “hospital crowding”) impairs ED output and is associated with increased waiting times in the ED, especially for patients awaiting hospital admission (“boarding”). <b>Access</b> <b>block</b> has also been suspected to induce an admission-bias, causing only the sickest patients to be admitted to hospital when hospital beds are scarce. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate whether <b>access</b> <b>block</b> affected the prioritization of the level of care in ED patients so that patients {{were less likely to be}} admitted to a hospital bed at times of <b>access</b> <b>block</b> than otherwise. Part V addressed whether more patients were triaged out of the ED at times of <b>access</b> <b>block.</b> Methods: In Part I, the proportion of hospital admissions among 118, 668 visits to the ED, at a 420 -bed emergency hospital in Region Skåne, Sweden, was compared across different levels of <b>access</b> <b>block</b> (measured as strata of in-hospital bed occupancy). Multivariate models were constructed to adjust for the effects of known confounders. In Part II, the appropriateness of ED discharges was addressed by comparing the proportion of unplanned 72 h revisits to the ED across different levels of <b>access</b> <b>block,</b> for the 81, 878 cases treated and released from the ED at index. In Part III, the outcomes evaluated in Parts I and II were addressed for 19, 620 ED visits due to acute abdominal pain. Part IV was performed analogously to Part III, but for 12, 223 ED visits due to chest pain. In Part V, the permeability of an ED front-end facility that triages patients of perceived low acuity out of the ED was compared across different levels of <b>access</b> <b>block,</b> for 37, 129 visits to the facility. Results: In Part I, a negative association between <b>access</b> <b>block</b> and the probability of inpatient admission was observed (OR 0. 67 – 0. 81 at occupancy > 105 %, compared to at occupancy < 95 %), implying that patients were less likely to be admitted to the hospital at times of <b>access</b> <b>block.</b> Part II revealed no association between <b>access</b> <b>block</b> and the 72 h revisit rate. The association detected in Part I remained for the study populations addressed in Parts III/IV. No association between <b>access</b> <b>block</b> and the 72 h revisit rate was observed in patients with acute abdominal pain, but a negative association between the two was observed in patients with chest pain. ED length of stay in patients who were treated and released from the ED increased at times of <b>access</b> <b>block,</b> in Parts III/IV. Conclusion: ED patients were less likely to be admitted to a hospital bed at times of <b>access</b> <b>block</b> than otherwise, at the study site. The lack of an association with the 72 h revisit rate could be interpreted as that the practice is safe, but since it fails to take into account rare, but fatal, outcomes such as mortality, future studies should address more granular patient outcomes and specific subgroups. Cost-effectiveness analysis could help to evaluate the viability of managing certain conditions in the ED as compared to in inpatient wards...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Access</b> <b>block</b> is the {{inability}} of ED patients requiring admission to access appropriate inpatient beds in a timely fashion, defined in Australasia as more than 8 h in the ED. The present study describes changes in prevalence of <b>access</b> <b>block</b> in Australia over a 4 year period. METHODS: Email, telephone and fax survey of ED on six Mondays at 10. 00 hours (31 May, 30 August 2004, 18 June, 3 September 2007, 2 June, 2 September 2008). Data collected included point data {{on the status of}} patients in the ED at the index time and of recent ED attendance numbers. Results were collated and analysed by state and hospital role delineation. RESULTS: Forty-eight (60 %) of 80 eligible ED answered all six surveys. Presentations to the ED the day before rose 15 % (P < 0. 0001, paired t-test) in 4 years, and nationally <b>access</b> <b>block</b> patients in the ED rose an average of 27 %, and patients waiting to be seen by a doctor 31 %. There were differences between states, with hospitals in New South Wales reporting a significant reduction in <b>access</b> <b>block</b> patients (- 51 %, P= 0. 0002), but all other states a significant increase (+ 45 %, P= 0. 001). There were differences by role delineation, with non-paediatric major referral hospitals experiencing the greatest <b>access</b> <b>block,</b> but smaller hospitals experiencing the greatest increase in patients waiting. CONCLUSIONS: Around one-third of all patients receiving care in these ED surveys were experiencing <b>access</b> <b>block.</b> There is evidence that flow through New South Wales ED has improved.

Results: There has been a significant reduction in both <b>access</b> <b>block</b> and our number of long-stay patients corresponding with improvements in NEAT compliance. Our forward analysis suggests that without substantial improvements in the NEAT for admitted patients, compliance with 2014 and 2015 thresholds is unlikely to be achievable.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Access</b> <b>block</b> {{refers to}} the delay caused for {{patients}} in gaining access to in-patient beds after being admitted. It is almost always associated with emergency department overcrowding. This study aimed to identify evidence-based strategies that can be followed in emergency departments and hospital settings to alleviate the problem of <b>access</b> <b>block</b> and emergency department overcrowding; and to explore the applicability of these solutions in Hong Kong. Data sources: A systematic literature review was performed by searching the following databases: CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE (OVID), NHS Evidence, Scopus, and PubMed. Study selection: The search terms used were “emergency department, <b>access</b> <b>block,</b> overcrowding”. The inclusion criteria were full-text articles, studies, economic evaluations, reviews, editorials, and commentaries. The exclusion criteria were studies not based in the emergency departments or hospitals, and abstracts. Data extraction: Abstracts of identified papers were screened, and papers were selected if they contained facts, data, or scientific evidence related to interventions that aimed at improving outcome measures for emergency department overcrowding and/or <b>access</b> <b>block.</b> Papers identified were used to locate further references. Data synthesis: All relevant scientific studies were evaluated for strengths and weaknesses using appraisal tools developed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. We identified solutions broadly classified into the following categories: (1) strategies addressing emergency department overcrowding: co-locating primary care within the emergency department, and fast-track and emergency nurse practitioners; and (2) strategies addressing access block: holding units, early discharge and patient flow, and political action—management and resource priority.
