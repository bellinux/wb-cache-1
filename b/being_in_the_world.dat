Jafar uses his last wish to become a genie and create his own lamp. Aladdin frees Jasmine, and uses Jafar's lamp to trap the latter and Iago.|$|E

500|$|Luhr (2009) {{states that}} Christian metal expresses feeling of {{isolation}} and rebellion just like non-Christian metal - but {{in a completely different}} way. Christian metal's rebellion is about [...] "Christian opposition to the perceived sinfulness and immorality of a late modern society and culture in which traditional family values have been eroded through such things as the legalization and increasing acceptability of abortion and pornography and the rise of gay rights and feminist movements." [...] Causes for the feeling of isolation can be explained with the fundamental Christian struggle of <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> but not of it. Bloodgood and Barren Cross inverted the meaning of rebellion by declaring that in Western society and culture the Christian faith is true rebellion. As in non-Christian metal, fans are encouraged to stand up for their faith, think for themselves and not blindly follow authorities, including religious ones.|$|E

There are three {{varieties}} of Haki: [...] allows one to sense {{the presence of other}} beings and to have a form of limited precognition. (This is a great advantage in combat because the user can foresee his opponent's attacks). [...] allows one to envelop body parts and even inanimate forms with a force akin to an invisible armor that possesses defensive and offensive properties. It also allows one to inflict harm upon Devil Fruit users. The rare [...] is an ability that, unlike the other two Haki, only a few gifted people have. (If a person is not gifted, then no matter how much they train they {{will never be able to}} use it). The Color of the Conquering King enables one to overpower the will of the weak-willed. It can be used to mind-control or even render the victim unconscious. Note that strong willed people can withstand, or even completely ignore, the effects of this Haki, even if they do not possess this ability themselves. This Haki can also have physical impacts, such as causing tremors and destruction to the user's surrounding area. It is shown that when it is used too much Haki will stop working for certain periods of time.|$|E

Eventually, [...] "in his reworking of Husserl, Sartre found himself {{coming back to the}} themes he had absorbed from Heidegger's Was ist Metaphysik?"

2500|$|Since {{ancient times}} {{representation}} {{has played a}} central role in understanding literature, aesthetics and semiotics. Plato and Aristotle are key figures in early literary theory who considered literature as simply one form of representation. Aristotle for instance, considered each mode of representation, verbal, visual or musical, as being natural to human beings. Therefore, what distinguishes humans from other animals is their ability to create and manipulate signs. Aristotle deemed mimesis as natural to man, therefore considered representations as necessary for people's learning and <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Plato, in contrast, looked upon representation with more caution. He recognised that literature is a representation of life, yet also believed that representations create worlds of illusion leading one away from the [...] "real things". For Plato, representation, like contemporary media, intervenes between the viewer and the real, creating illusions that lead one away from [...] "real things". Plato believed that representation needs therefore, to be controlled and monitored due to the possible dangers resulting in its ability to foster antisocial emotions or encourage the imitation of evil.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the further}} {{explanations}} of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven {{is not merely}} sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition {{is not one of}} <b>the</b> <b>beings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> However, unlike <b>the</b> God of these religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside <b>the</b> <b>world</b> either, but is within humans, which is the primary concern of Confucianism, and other <b>beings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Tian is <b>the</b> ontological substance of reality, is immanent <b>in</b> every human <b>being</b> as the human nature (ren), but the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that «the one who can fully realize one's heart/mind can understand one's nature, and the one who can understand one's own nature can know Tian»; Tian is within us, but before we fulfill our heart/mind and know our nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to us. Mou cites Max Muller that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become» to reflect th idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach Tian.|$|R
