5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas <b>bond</b> {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United <b>Bond</b> Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 <b>bond.</b> The supersedeas <b>bond</b> allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 <b>bond</b> until a ruling on the matter was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965.

5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's <b>Bond</b> novels in his 1965 work The James <b>Bond</b> Dossier. Although novelizations {{of two of the}} Eon Productions <b>Bond</b> films appeared in print, James <b>Bond,</b> The Spy Who Loved Me and James <b>Bond</b> and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen <b>Bond</b> books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the <b>Bond</b> series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James <b>Bond</b> books due to ill health.|$|E
