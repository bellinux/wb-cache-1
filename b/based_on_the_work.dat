5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the city of}} Tapiocapolis was visually based on the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. His {{depiction of}} a public sculpture in the city was inspired by the work of sculptor Marcel Arnould, while the paintings that he designed for the Tapiocapolis hotel in which Tintin and Haddock stay are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Serge Poliakoff.|$|E

5|$|Monotype's {{well-known}} executive Stanley Morison {{wrote in}} his memoir that the italic was based on Granjon's work, but as Carter's annotations of it note, this seems generally to be a mistake. The swash capitals, however, at least, probably are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Granjon. Some publicity art {{for it in the}} metal period was created by a young Rodney Peppé.|$|E
5|$|The Decree on Romanisation {{made this}} law in April, 1928. The Latin variant for Tajik was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> by Turcophone {{scholars}} who aimed {{to produce a}} unified Turkic alphabet, despite Tajik not being a Turkic language. The literacy campaign was successful, with near-universal literacy being achieved by the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Flying Eagle cent is a one-cent piece {{struck by}} the Mint of the United States as a pattern coin in 1856, and for {{circulation}} in 1857 and 1858. The coin was designed by Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre, with the eagle in flight <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Longacre's predecessor, Christian Gobrecht.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} need for a {{thorough}} revision of the taxonomy of the flowering plants (angiosperms), systematists formed the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998. The scheme was largely <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Kåre Bremer and colleagues at Uppsala and Stockholm universities in the late 1970s, and became universally accessible on the internet in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David felt that it was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, {{there was no evidence that}} he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
5|$|That same year, a {{group of}} liberal ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views known as the Auburn Affirmation {{due to the fact}} that it was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, the Affirmation claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to the Affirmation, the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to the five fundamentals.|$|E

5|$|Using {{astronomy}} software, and {{an article}} written by astronomer Craig Chester <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Ernest Martin, Larson thinks all nine {{characteristics of the}} Star of Bethlehem are found in events {{that took place in}} the skies of 3-2 BC. Highlights include a triple conjunction of Jupiter, called the king planet, with the fixed star Regulus, called the king star, starting in September 3 BC. Larson believes that may be the time of Jesus' conception.|$|E
5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Boole and Schröder.|$|E
5|$|Blomkvist's {{daughter}} Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him {{and notes}} that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection {{to a series of}} murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.|$|E

5|$|Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, George Ripley {{was pushed}} to attend Harvard College {{by his father}} and {{completed}} his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School {{and the next year}} married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put Transcendental beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.|$|E
5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy {{as an attempt to}} respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and {{as an alternative to the}} traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E
5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its italic (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something particularly true in its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for headings and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E

50|$|But Never Jam Today was a 1979 musical {{with music}} by Bert Keyes & Bob Larimer, lyrics by Larimer, {{and a book}} by both Larimer and Vinnette Carroll. <b>The</b> musical is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Lewis Carroll.|$|R
50|$|According to writer James Oroc, the 1990s {{brought about}} a second phase in modern {{psychedelic}} culture. The 'philosophical foundation' of this new wave of psychedelic thought was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Alexander Shulgin, Alex Grey and Terence McKenna.|$|R
5|$|Romanticism {{has also}} been seen as {{affecting}} scientific enquiry. Romantic attitudes to science varied, from distrust of the scientific enterprise to endorsing a non-mechanical science that rejected the mathematicised and the abstract theorising associated with Newton. Major trends in continental science associated with Romanticism include Naturphilosophie, developed by Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854), which focused on the necessity of reuniting man with nature, and Humboldtian science, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). As defined by Susan Cannon, this form of inquiry placed a stress on observation, accurate scientific instruments and new conceptual tools; disregarded the boundaries between different disciplines; and emphasised working in nature rather than the artificial laboratory. Privileging observation above calculation, Romantic scientists were often attracted to the areas where investigation, rather than calculation and theory, was most important, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci {{refused to}} copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering {{portrait}} of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness to be <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly sacked. The Mint did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint {{for the rest of}} his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.|$|E
5|$|<b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn {{went on in}} 1998 {{to propose}} a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E
