5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Other {{modes of}} {{transmission}} include organ transplantation, through breast milk, and by accidental laboratory exposure. Chagas disease can also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> congenitally (from {{a pregnant woman}} to her baby) through the placenta, and accounts for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The Arabic {{language}} and the Muslim religion continued to <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> in South Sudan by merchants and administrators from the North, and even by British officials who preferred to speak Arabic rather than learn the local language.|$|E
25|$|Heartworm {{disease in}} dogs <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by {{mosquitoes}} and <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by the parasite Dirofilaria immitis. Signs include cough, difficulty breathing, and death.|$|R
30|$|Both Buddhism and Catholicism <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> {{into many}} {{countries}} {{all over the}} world. Buddhism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{to a number of}} Asian countries such as China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, and Bhutan to the north, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia to the south. 8 By the nineteenth century, Buddhism was introduced into Europe, Australia, America and then Africa by Western scholars and immigrants. 9 Like Buddhism, Catholicism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Roman Empire and to north Europe through the fourth and fifth centuries. 10 By the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> to America, Asia and Africa.|$|R

5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed {{upgrades}} to its building {{systems and}} facilities. The company {{spent two years}} deciding whether to renovate its current building or to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided {{to stay in the}} current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason for the company to stay. The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would likely have to <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> out over several floors.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, {{which is not the}} case for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
50|$|Veneration of Benedict <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{throughout}} Latin America, from Mexico through Argentina. In Venezuela, particularly, {{his devotion}} <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> through the country's various states, {{and he is}} celebrated on many different dates, according to the local traditions.|$|R

Balaghat Hills <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> in South Marathwada, North Andhra & North Karnataka Districts. Mahadev Hills <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> in North Karnataka (Belgaum-Bijapur-Raichur) Districts and South Maharashtra.|$|R
50|$|The ancient Ahichchhatra <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{in large}} area and its ruins are still found {{around the city}} Ramnagar. According to the Chinese {{traveler}} ‘Hventsang’ this place <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{in the area of}} 3 miles and many Stupas were also constructed here.|$|R
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> {{out over a}} larger number of individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the stewardship of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The wettest {{conditions}} {{persist in}} the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time. Precipitation tends to <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland {{are not in a}} stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods.|$|E

5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E

Its urban agglomeration <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> over an area of 28.88 km2 which includes constituents of Nandyal municipality, out growths of Moolasagaram, Noonepalle and partial outgrowths of Udumalpuram, Ayyalur.|$|R
5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> to livestock.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
