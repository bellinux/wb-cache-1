In the last 2 years, Congress has provided fewer resources than requested by the executive branch and generated by the FBF. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff and GSA officials stated that if GSA were able to spend all of the funds collected by the FBF each year, these funds would generally be sufficient to fund GSAs needs. However, GSA, through the annual Presidents Budget Request, has sought less obligational authority than the <b>balance</b> <b>available</b> in the fund. While the FBFs balance has increased, various factors have limited the funds income. Funds from operationsrevenue less costs excluding depreciationthat contribute to FBF income have declined from 2006 to 2011 when adjusted for inflation. Revenues have declined while costs have outstripped inflation over this time period. In addition, portions of GSAs inventory operate at a loss. For example, about 30 percent of GSAs owned assets lost money in 2011, while GSAs total leased portfolio lost about $ 75 million. Despite the losses in its leased portfolio, GSA continues to rely extensively on leasing. GSA is taking steps {{to reduce the size}} of its overall real estate portfolio. ...|$|E

Our empirical results also indicate that CEOs desire their firms to be acquired by decreasing shareholders’ equity, thus supporting the view that change in control payments exist primarily for incumbent managers. Our findings provide support to the proposition that managers enjoy having large cash <b>balances</b> to be <b>available</b> to them as it allows them with greater opportunities to derive personal benefit from it.

The fish catch can be optimised by selecting the hook with right {{shape and size}} (Huse and Ferno, 1990). Hook size and shape have to be optimised for the target species and size groups. In studies relating to longline fishing, {{it has often been}} shown that smaller hooks catch greater numbers of fish than larger hooks (Bjordal, 1989; Ralston, 1990). The line fishery is found to be very effective in exploiting large predator fishes, such as catfishes, elasmobranchs, tunnies, seerfishes and perches from uneven non-trawlable fishing grounds of coastal waters with coral or rocky outcrops (Jayasankar, 1990). The structure of longline used by the fishermen varies from place to place.

40|$|KNOWLEDGE of intake drag is {{important}} in estimating {{the performance of the}} aerospace vehicle. The contribution to the intake drag is mainly due to the external and internal flow through the intake and termed as external and internal drag. External drag is mainly composed of drag due to cowl, diverter, and spillage of flow (pre-entry drag), while the internal drag is due to the wall skin friction and pressure distribution {{on the walls of the}} duct. Various components of the drag associated with a typical intake of an air-breathing vehicle are shown in Fig. 1. It is possible to estimate the internal drag in the absence of any flow separation while the estimation of external drag is difficult particularly when the intake is operating in subcritical condition. At this operating condition of intake, experimental method is the only source to determine the intake drag. Hitherto, drag due to intake alone is measured having the intake specially mounted to the forebody of the fuselage and front portion of intake forming a metric part with a <b>balance.</b> <b>Available</b> test techniques demand a special balance and suitable modifications to the intake module [1]. This is cumbersome and involves more time and additional cost towards design, fabrication and calibration of new balance. As an alternative, a test technique developed and patented for the direct measurement of after body drag in the base flow wind tunnel [2 – 4] is used to demonstrate the usefulness of this technique for the measurement of intake drag in a limited Mach number range. An important feature of this test technique (Fig. 2) is that it facilitates simultaneous measurements of total pressure recovery profiles of the duct flow as well as intake drag for the different mass flow conditions...|$|E

Our simulations show that the proposed load balancing scheme significantly improves the performance of a P 2 P system in terms of <b>balanced</b> <b>available</b> capacity.

40|$|An {{important}} {{operational decision}} that a seller {{has to make}} is how to price his product under different situations. This dissertation addresses three unique pricing problems, commonly faced by a seller in a supply chain, {{in a series of}} three essays. The first essay considers a supplier's problem of choosing which type of contracts to offer to a retailer whose demand forecasts can be improved over time. It is shown that there exist mechanisms which enable the supplier to always benefit from the retailer's improved demand forecasts. Such a mechanism consists of an initial contract, offered to the retailer before she obtains improved forecasts, and a later contract (contingent on the initial contract), offered to the retailer after she obtains improved forecasts. The second essay investigates a retailer's problem of choosing which form of price promotions to offer to consumers, some of which are more inclined to increase spending when satisfied with the value of the deals. Two types of promotions are considered: i) all-unit discount, where a price reduction applies to every unit of a purchase that meets the minimum requirement, and ii) fixed-amount discount, where the final amount that a consumer has to pay is reduced by a predetermined discount amount if the purchase meets the minimum requirement. It is shown that both discount schemes can induce consumers to overspend. However, depending on consumer valuation of the product, one scheme can be more profitable to the retailer than the other. The third essay discusses a dual-channel retailer's problem of choosing a price differentiating policy (charging different prices for the same product sold at different channels) and/or inventory transshipping policy (transferring inventory between the channels) to <b>balance</b> <b>available</b> inventory and demand arriving at each channel. It is shown that the two mechanisms have different implications on sales volume. Which mechanism is more effective depends on the retailer's initial inventory position. Furthermore, when implemented concurrently, the benefit from price differentiation and inventory transshipment mechanisms may either substitute or complement each other...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect on student achievement (i. e., comprehension and retention of declarative knowledge) that resulted from teaching process simulation using manual methods as compared to computer-based methods, specifically ProModel 2. 0. The methodology used in this study was based on a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest research design. The sample for this study consisted of 32 students enrolled in IT 442 [...] Industrial Production for the Spring Semester 1996 at Purdue University. Students were divided into experimental and control groups according to which lab section they attended. Each group had 16 subjects. Because this sample size was small, statistical power calculations were used to verify sample size adequacy. The treatment for this study was an instructional unit on process simulation. The control treatment used manual simulation methods, the experimental treatment focused on computer-based simulation using ProModel. A pretest was administered to all students at the beginning of the study to assess whether the groups were equivalent in their prior knowledge of simulation. After both groups completed the instructional unit, a posttest was administered. All statistical analyses were carried out at the 0. 10 level of significance. The t-test used to compare pretest/posttest improvement scores was statistically significant in favor of ProModel (p-value = 0. 05). This result, along with additional quantitative and qualitative evidence presented in this document, lead the researcher to conclude that ProModel was a more effective teaching/learning tool than the manual method. However, this study did not definitely conclude which method was better. Such an answer depends largely on the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s ability to <b>balance</b> <b>available</b> resources. The main advantage of the manual method was that it required less time from both the instructor and students. The main disadvantage was that manual simulation is not widely used in industry. Simulation packages such as ProModel are common in industry. Students also acquire a valuable skill that could give them a competitive advantage upon entering the job market. ...|$|E
