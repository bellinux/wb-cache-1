5|$|The ribosomes coded {{for by the}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{are similar}} to those from <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> size and structure. They closely resemble the bacterial 70S ribosome and not the 80S cytoplasmic ribosomes, which are coded for by nuclear DNA.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of asymptomatic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E

40|$|A new {{microring}} resonator {{system is}} {{proposed for the}} detection of the Salmonella <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> drinking water, which is made up of SiO 2 -TiO 2 waveguide embedded inside thin film layer of the flagellin. The change in refractive index due to the binding of the Salmonella bacterium with flagellin layer causes a shift in the output signal wavelength and the variation in through and drop port's intensities, which leads to the detection of Salmonella <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> drinking water. The sensitivity of proposed sensor for detecting of Salmonella <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> water solution is 149 nm/RIU and the limit of detection is 7 × 10 - 4 RIU...|$|R

5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species.

5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to examine the morphology and antigenicity of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida by culturing the <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> vivo in the peritoneal cavity of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) within dialysis bags with either a low molecular weight (LMW) cut-off of 25 kDa or a high molecular weight (HMW) cut-off of 300 kDa. Differences were observed in the growth rate between the <b>bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vivo or <b>in</b> vitro. <b>Bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vivo were smaller and produced a capsular layer, which was more prominent <b>in</b> <b>bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> the HMW bag. Antigenicity was examined by Western blot analysis using sera from sea bass injected with live Ph. d. subsp. piscicida. The sera recognised bands at 45 and 20 kDa <b>in</b> <b>bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vivo in the LMW bag. <b>Bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vivo in the HMW bag did not express the 45 kDa band when whole cell extracts were examined, although the antigen was present in their extracellular products. <b>In</b> addition, these <b>bacteria</b> had a band at 18 kDa rather than 20 kDa. Differences in glycoprotein were also evident between <b>bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vitro and <b>in</b> vivo. <b>Bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vitro in LMW and HMW bags displayed a single 26 kDa band. <b>Bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> the LMW bag in vivo displayed bands at 26 and 27 kDa, while <b>bacteria</b> cultured <b>in</b> vivo in the HMW bag possessed only the 27 kDa band. These bands may represent sialic acid. The significance of the changes observed <b>in</b> the <b>bacterium's</b> structure and antigenicity when cultured in vivo is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Palmer {{publishes a}} study which finds no <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the human stomach. He concludes earlier discoveries were {{a result of}} contamination.

5|$|Several species {{sometimes}} {{suffer from}} a wasting condition caused by <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the genus Vibrio; however, a more widespread wasting disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine, where the correct treatment {{is determined by}} the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (<b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
