50|$|A <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> is {{the amount}} of money that {{individuals}} could borrow from other individuals, firms, banks or governments.There are many types of borrowing limits, and a natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> is one specific type of <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> among those.When individuals are said to face the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit,</b> it implies they are allowed to borrow up to the sum of all their future incomes.A natural debt limit and a natural borrowing constraint are other ways to refer to the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{accumulation}} of human capital and the behavior of consumption and earnings in a life cycle equilibrium model with endogenous borrowing constraints. Constraints arise endogenously from the inalienability of human capital and the limited punishments that creditors are able to impose on those who default. The endogeneity of borrowing constraints produces a number of interesting relationships. First, efficient <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits</b> are functions of individual observable characteristics and choices, especially ability and human capital investments. The connection between human capital investments and <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits</b> creates additional incentives to invest beyond those present in models with exogenous constraints. Second, government policies affect the incentives to default and, hence, the <b>limits</b> on private <b>borrowing.</b> As opposed to exogenous constraint models, additional subsidies for investment in human capital should be accompanied by increases in credit, since borrowers are more able to re-pay higher debts. Finally, general equilibrium considerations have an additional role, since <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits</b> depend on the returns to physical and human capital. We calibrate the model to U.

50|$|However {{banks will}} not lend {{infinite}} amount money {{unless they are}} philanthropists. They will only lend reasonable amount money {{so that they could}} receive back from the students without too much risk. If banks are willing to lend $6,000,000 to the student, then, it is said that students face the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit,</b> because they are allowed to borrow exactly up to the amount which they earn for their lifetime. If students are only allowed to borrow less than $6,000,000, then it is said that they face a <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> tighter than the natural borrowing limit.One caveat is that the concept natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> does not depend on what amount of money that law students borrow. In this example, they will not borrow more than $200,000, but, {{as long as they are}} allowed to borrow $6,000,000, then it is enough to say students are in the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> world.|$|E
50|$|The {{way that}} the <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> is imposed on the {{consumer}} utility maximization problem {{is very important in}} the economic research, since, it affects the stream of consumption, and thus welfare of the agent.It is well known in the economics that, in general, the risk averse agents are better off when they can smooth the consumption across the time. Under the incomplete asset market assumption, the ability for the agent to smooth the consumption (consumption smoothing) across the time is, in general, limited when the <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> is tighter than the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit.</b> However, consumer can smooth the consumption almost surely under the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit,</b> even under the incomplete market assumption. Hence, {{depending on the type of}} borrowing limits imposed on the utility maximization, consumers might end up having different levels of utility even if their current discounted value of their incomes are identical.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the various}} types of {{borrowing}} limits, the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> imposes one of the weakest restriction on the consumer utility maximization problem. The natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> says, the maximum amount of money that the agent can borrow is limited to the agents present discounted value of the entire income stream. This limit comes from the common sense requirement {{that it has to be}} feasible for the consumer to repay his debt in every possible realization of the future. The terminology was first introduced by Rao Aiyagari (1994), and any other borrowing limits which are stronger than the natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> are defined as adhoc borrowing constraint ...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{debt and}} {{bankruptcy}} are central issues {{today because of}} their explosive trends over the last 20 years in the U. S. economy. However, there is no convincing explanation for these facts. A drop in information costs, a potential cause, has not been evaluated mainly {{because there is no}} quantitative theory of consumer debt and bankruptcy where the cost of information plays an important role. This paper provides such a theory and quantifies how much of the rise in debt and bankruptcy {{can be attributed to the}} drop in information costs. In the model, lenders offer contracts specifying both interest rates and <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits.</b> In equilibrium, the contracts with low interest rates have tight <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits,</b> while those with high interest rates have loose <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits.</b> Despite being <b>borrowing</b> constrained, low-risk individuals prefer to borrow at the low interest rate. Conversely, high-risk individuals prefer to borrow more at higher interest rates. As the costs of information drop, it may be possible to explicitly condition loans on an individual’s risk. This allows previously borrowing constrained individuals to borrow more. As a result, there is also mor...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{conventional}} wisdom in economics that public debt {{can serve as}} a substitute for private credit if private <b>borrowing</b> is <b>limited.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that, while a government could in principle use such a policy to fully relax <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits,</b> this is not generally optimal. In our economy, agents invest in a short-term asset, a long-term asset, and government bonds. Agents are subject to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks prior to the maturity of the long-term asset. We show that a high public debt policy fully relaxes private <b>borrowing</b> <b>limits</b> and is suboptimal. This is because agents expecting such a policy respond by investing less than is socially optimal in the short asset which can protect them in the event of a liquidity shock. The optimal policy is more constrained and it induces a wedge between the technological rate of return on the long asset and the rate of return on bonds. In such a regime, agents subject to liquidity shocks are also borrowing constrained, and this expectation of being borrowing constrained induces them to invest the optimal level in the short asset.

50|$|The natural <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit</b> is {{one type}} of {{restriction}} imposed on the consumer utility maximization problem in the economics.In the standard consumer utility maximization problem of the economic agent, she maximizes utility by consuming goods. In making an optimal consumption decision, she has {{to conform to the}} budget constraint she faces. In other words, she cannot consume more than the net of the income, amount of money she borrows, and debt repayment. However, if she could borrow any amount money she needs (i.e. absence of the <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit),</b> obviously she will borrow infinite amount of money and consume infinitely as well. To rule out such situation and Ponzi schemes, and to make above consumers problem more interesting, {{there has to be a}} <b>borrowing</b> <b>limit.</b> Such restriction will prevent her from financing infinite amount money for the infinite consumption.|$|E
