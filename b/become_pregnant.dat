5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> during menstruation.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Carey had {{suddenly}} cancelled a concert tour supporting her eleventh studio album, E=MC². There was heavy speculation {{in the media}} that Carey had <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> and had abandoned the plans for a tour as a result. The singer had later admitted {{that she was pregnant}} during that time period, and had suffered a miscarriage, leading to the cancellation of the tour.|$|E
50|$|Pallenberg later {{stated that}} she first <b>became</b> <b>pregnant</b> in 1968, {{but that she}} was {{pressured}} {{to have an abortion}} so she could take part in the film Performance, which caused her to feel extremely resentful. She <b>became</b> <b>pregnant</b> again with Marlon during the filming.|$|R

5|$|Birth control {{methods include}} barrier methods, {{hormonal}} birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective {{for up to}} a few days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> using a given method during the first year, and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.|$|E
5|$|The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn was {{directed}} by Bill Condon, and author Stephenie Meyer co-produced the film along with Karen Rosenfelt and Wyck Godfrey, with Melissa Rosenberg penning the script. The book's plot was split into two films, {{the first of which}} was released on November 18, 2011. The filming of Breaking Dawn began in November 2010. The first part follows Bella and Edward as they get married and then learn that Bella has <b>become</b> <b>pregnant.</b> They deal with her struggle of being pregnant and almost passing away because of the half vampire-half human child.|$|E

5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is a}} year of rest before they <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be few and far between due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E

5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had <b>become</b> <b>pregnant.</b> She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused {{to have anything to}} do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E
5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not address those rumours until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E

5|$|Chloe, to her distress, {{does not}} <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> immediately. Chris vainly tries {{to track down}} Nola, but meets her by chance some time later at the Tate Modern. He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris is {{spending}} time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, Chris asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying {{that she wants to}} raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him on the street outside his office and he just barely escapes public detection.|$|E
5|$|Doris {{travelled}} to Egypt {{to visit}} her husband in March 1917. By June, Rupert was becoming increasingly immersed in preparations for the Third Battle of Gaza and Doris, who had <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> during her visit, decided to return home. On her return journey to Australia in June 1917, her ship, the P liner Mongolia struck a mine and was sunk in the Indian Ocean {{with the loss of}} 23 lives. Doris spent 11 hours in a crowded lifeboat, before being rescued by a passing steamer, which took her to Bombay. From there she eventually made her way back to Australia via Singapore and Batavia. In 1918 Doris was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her volunteer work among soldiers' families as secretary of the Friendly Union of Soldiers' Wives and Mothers.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{is not a}} {{seasonal}} breeder, unlike the pygmy slow loris. Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12–18months and have a six-month gestation. Because they are not seasonal breeders, females could <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically {{give birth to a}} single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris, which commonly has twins. The mother carries her young about three months before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20months of age. The species is known to live up to 20years.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to <b>become</b> <b>pregnant,</b> is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Peter Kingdom, {{a small-town}} {{solicitor}} whose work revolves around cases {{brought by the}} eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed suicide. Each week there are further indications {{that he did not}} die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had <b>become</b> <b>pregnant</b> with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.|$|E
