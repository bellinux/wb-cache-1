40|$|Riveting {{operations}} in aircraft manufacturing {{involves the use}} of power tools for manually drilling holes for the rivets, power drills for the setting of the holes for the rivets, as well as rivet guns to drive and set the rivets. To close the rivet, the rivet is driven against a metallic bar commonly called a bucking bar. The <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> are typically held firmly to increase the quality of the riveting, as well as keep the bucking bar from dancing against the metal piece being riveted. Thus, employees in aircraft manufacturing involved in riveting are exposed to hand-arm vibration from several sources, and epidemiological evidence suggests that vibration-related musculoskeletal disorders are associated with long term exposure to riveting tasks in the aircraft manufacturing of aircraft. 1, 2 Recently, tungsten technology has been introduced into aircraft manufacturing for <b>bucking</b> <b>bars,</b> which are heavier than traditional steel <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> of the same size. Rivet guns with tungsten pistons instead of steel pistons have also recently been introduced with the objective of reducing vibration exposure to the riveter. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess vibration characteristics of steel and tungsten <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> and rivet guns to identify the combination that simultaneously reduced the combined exposure to both the riveter and bucker. Methods Vibration (10 g tri-axial accelerometer, Biometrics S 2 - 10 G-MF Series 2) was measured from eight experienced employees using seven different rivet guns on size 6 rivets, with the same person bucking for all subjects. Vibration was also measured on two different <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> for these same eight subjects, with the same person driving the rivets using the various rivet guns. The rivet guns consisted of three E 4 steel piston guns with different RPMs (Guns A-E 4, B-E 4, C-E 4), an E 4 vibration dampened rivet gun (Gun D-E 4 D), an E 3 steel piston rivet gun (Gun E-E 3) and an E 3 and E 4 tungsten piston rivet guns (Guns F-E 3 T and G-E 4 T). The <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> were made of 90 % tungsten (1694 g) and cold-rolled steel (843 g), and were the same shape and size. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was performed on the vibration (mean frequency weighted resultant acceleration) on both the rivet gun side and the bucking bar side, and mean rankings were used to assess the vibration simultaneously for the rivet gun and <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> to investigate which combinations provided the lowest vibration exposure. Results Frequency weighted resultant acceleration was significantly lower on the E 3 tungsten (F-E 3 T) rivet gun than the E 4 steel piston (B-E 4) and the E 4 tungsten piston (G-E 4 T) rivet guns (Figure 1). When measuring vibration on the bucking bar, the E 4 (A-E 4) steel piston rivet gun resulted in lower vibration on the <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> than the E 4 tungsten piston (G-E 4 T) and E 4 vibration dampened (D-E 4 D) rivet guns (Figure 2). Additionally, use of tungsten <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> resulted in a 35 % decrease in resultant frequency weighted acceleration than when using steel <b>bucking</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|E
40|$|Riveting {{tasks in}} {{aircraft}} manufacturing results in exposure to vibration from both rivet guns and <b>bucking</b> <b>bars.</b> Long term exposure to vibration {{has been associated}} with symptoms of vibration white finger and musculoskeletal disorders. Four different <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> of the same shape but different material and mass characteristics (90 % tungsten,> 90 % tungsten, cold rolled and stainless steel) were investigated for vibration and grip muscle activity during a riveting task. The> 90 % and 90 % tungsten bars (3. 4 m/s 2 and 3. 6 m/s 2, respectively) resulted in significantly less mean resultant weighted acceleration when compared to the cold rolled and stainless steel (5. 3 m/s 2 and 5. 6 m/s 2, respectively), whereas {{there was no difference in}} mean hand grip flexor or extensor muscle activity. These results suggest that for bucking tasks that allow access for the bucking bar size investigated, use of heavier but same sized tungsten <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> can reduce vibration transmission to the hand...|$|E
40|$|Sheet metal workers {{operating}} rivet <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> {{are at risk}} {{of developing}} hand and wrist musculoskeletal disorders associated with exposures to hand-transmitted vibrations and forceful exertions required to operate these hand tools. New bucking bar technologies have been introduced in efforts to reduce workplace vibration exposures to these workers. However, the efficacy of these new bucking bar designs has not been well documented. While there are standardized laboratory-based methodologies for assessing the vibration emissions of many types of powered hand tools, no such standard exists for rivet <b>bucking</b> <b>bars.</b> Therefore, this study included the development of a laboratory-based method for assessing bucking bar vibrations which utilizes a simulated riveting task. With this method, this study evaluated three traditional steel <b>bucking</b> <b>bars,</b> three similarly shaped tungsten alloy bars, and three bars featuring spring-dampeners. For comparison the bucking bar vibrations were also assessed during three typical riveting tasks at a large aircraft maintenance facility. The <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> were rank-ordered in terms of unweighted and frequency-weighted acceleration measured at the hand-tool interface. The results suggest that the developed laboratory method is a reasonable technique for ranking bucking bar vibration emissions; the lab-based riveting simulations produced similar rankings to the workplace rankings. However, the laboratory-based acceleration averages were considerably lower than the workplace measurements. These observations suggest that the laboratory test results are acceptable for comparing and screening <b>bucking</b> <b>bars,</b> but the laboratory measurements should not be directly used for assessing the risk of workplace bucking bar vibration exposures. The newer bucking bar technologies exhibited significantly reduced vibrations compared to the traditional steel bars. The results of this study, together with other information such as rivet quality, productivity, tool weight, comfort, worker acceptance, and initial cost {{can be used to make}} informed bucking bar selections.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Psychology"December 2007. "Steel <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> used in {{sheet metal}} {{assembly}} tasks lack application of ergonomic principles. Four bucking bar interventions were evaluated and {{compared to a}} steel bucking bar. The interventions included a tungsten bucking bar, Viscolas® rubber wrap adhered to a steel bucking bar, a steel bar paired with an anti-vibration glove, and a steel bar with a detachable handle. All interventions and the steel bar were evaluated for vibration transmitted to the hand and elbow, relative muscle activity of the flexor and extensor muscle groups of the forearms, and usability. Vibration data collected at the hand revealed that the steel bucking bar transmitted the most vibration and the tungsten bucking bar transmitted the least. Transmission of vibration to the hand using the detachable handle was comparable to the tungsten bucking bar. All bucking bar interventions {{failed to meet the}} ANSI S 2. 70 standard for vibration exposure at the hand. Vibration measured at the elbow revealed that the tungsten bucking bar and the handle transmitted the least amount of vibration while the steel bucking bar and the steel bar with the Viscolas® wrap transmitted the most vibration to the elbow. The anti-vibration glove transmitted more vibration than the tungsten bar and the handle, but overall, less vibration was transmitted using the anti-vibration glove than the steel bar at both the hand and elbow. Electromyography (EMG) was used to measure relative muscle activity of the flexor and extensor muscle groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} any of the interventions or the steel bar for the extensor muscle group. However, the handle produced the least amount of relative forearm flexor muscle activity. In terms of usability, participants perceived less exertion using the tungsten bucking bar and were more likely to recommend the tungsten <b>bucking</b> <b>bars</b> to others. Half of the participants ranked the tungsten bucking bar as their first choice of all the interventions tested. The handle and the wrap were also considered usable by most participants. Participants perceived the most exertion using the steel bucking bar and were less likely to recommend it to others. Vibration, EMG, and usability measures were also analyzed for differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic participants. Relative flexor muscle activity was found to be significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic participants required less flexor muscle activity to grip the handle during the bucking task comparable to muscle activity levels in asymptomatic participants. The anti-vibration glove produced the highest mean flexor muscle activity in symptomatic participants. Conversely, the glove produced the lowest mean flexor muscle activity in asymptomatic participants. In conclusion, the steel bucking bar transmitted more vibration to the hand and elbow and was not considered usable in terms of preference and perceived exertion. The tungsten bucking bar decreased vibration transmission to the hand and elbow without increased relative grip muscle activity. Decreased flexor muscle activity was observed for the handle and was especially pronounced in symptomatic participants. In general, the anti-vibration glove and Viscolas® wrap did transmit less vibration than the steel bucking bar alone. However, these types of interventions may be better suited for damping high frequency, low impact vibration...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDFingers-transmitted {{vibration}} {{can cause}} vibration-induced white finger. The effectiveness of vibration-reducing (VR) gloves for reducing hand transmitted vibration to the fingers {{has not been}} sufficiently examined. OBJECTIVEThe objective {{of this study is}} to examine tool-specific performance of VR gloves for reducing finger-transmitted vibrations in three orthogonal directions (3 D) from powered hand tools. METHODSA transfer function method was used to estimate the tool-specific effectiveness of four typical VR gloves. The transfer functions of the VR glove fingers in three directions were either measured in this study or during a previous study using a 3 D laser vibrometer. More than seventy vibration spectra of various tools or machines were used in the estimations. RESULTSWhen assessed based on frequency-weighted acceleration, the gloves provided little vibration reduction. In some cases, the gloves amplified the vibration by more than 10 %, especially the neoprene glove. However, the neoprene glove did the best when the assessment was based on unweighted acceleration. The neoprene glove was able to reduce the vibration by 10 % or more of the unweighted vibration for 27 out of the 79 tools. If the dominant vibration of a tool handle or workpiece was in the shear direction relative to the fingers, as observed in the operation of needle scalers, hammer chisels, and <b>bucking</b> <b>bars,</b> the gloves did not reduce the vibration but increased it. CONCLUSIONSThis study confirmed that the effectiveness for reducing vibration varied with the gloves and the vibration reduction of each glove depended on tool, vibration direction to the fingers, and finger location. VR gloves, including certified anti-vibration gloves do not provide much vibration reduction when judged based on frequency-weighted acceleration. However, some of the VR gloves can provide more than 10 % reduction of the unweighted vibration for some tools or workpieces. Tools and gloves can be matched for better effectiveness for protecting the fingers. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 11 - 17 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 27867313 PMC 511302...|$|E

50|$|A rivet gun, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive rivets. The rivet gun is used on the manufactured head side of the rivet and a <b>bucking</b> <b>bar</b> is used on the buck-tail side of the rivet. The energy from the hammer in the rivet gun drives the work and the rivet against the inertia of the <b>bucking</b> <b>bar.</b> As a result, the tail of the rivet is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the rivet head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all rivet guns are pneumatically powered. Those rivet guns used to drive rivets in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A rivet gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|R
25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer {{on one side}} and a <b>bucking</b> <b>bar</b> on the head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|R

In response to the influx of miners, most of them (but not all) American, Governor Douglas decreed the creation of the Stikine Territory, covering the lands inland from Russian American between the line of the Nass and Finlay Rivers north to the 62nd parallel to prevent American feared American annexation of the region, just as he had created the Colony of British Columbia in similar circumstances and had witnessed the loss of the Oregon Country to American settlers previously.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of blind rivets, installation of a solid rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer {{on one side and a}} <b>bucking</b> <b>bar</b> on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an [...] "improved means of closing tubular rivets" [...] (granted May 1917). In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent that incorporated the pull-through mandrel, and allowed the rivet to be used blind. By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet company produced a [...] "cup" [...] rivet based on the design. It required a separate GKN mandrel and the rivet body to be hand assembled prior to use for the building of the Siskin III aircraft. Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo.
