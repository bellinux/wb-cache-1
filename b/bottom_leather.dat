5000|$|... "Through-{{registered}} pouches" [...] {{were not}} only made of canvas, but had several thick staples at the top where a long leather strap passed through and locked for extra security. These pouches that transported registered mail between large cities were made with <b>leather</b> <b>bottoms</b> for extra strength.|$|R
60|$|In its <b>bottom</b> {{were two}} <b>leather</b> mail-pouches, {{a couple of}} blankets, coffee-pot and frying-pan, and a scant grub-sack. As for the men, so frosted were they, and so numb with the cold, that they could hardly stand. Dave Harney {{proposed}} whiskey, and was for haling them away at once; but one delayed long enough to shake stiff hands with Jacob Welse.|$|R
50|$|Since wooden {{footwear}} was a hand-made product, {{the shape}} of the footwear, as well as its production process showed great local and regional diversity in style. At the beginning of the 20th century machine-made wooden footwear was introduced. After WW2, in particular, wooden shoes disappeared from sight. They were replaced by more fashionable all-leather and synthetic footwear. At present, only the so-called Swedish clogs (wooden <b>bottom</b> and <b>leather</b> top) is still seen as a trendy fashion item, often as ladies’ high-heeled boots. Nevertheless, traditional wooden footwear is still popular in several regions in Europe and in some occupations, for its practical use. Some historic local variations have recently been replaced by uniform national models.|$|R

50|$|The catcher pouch is a {{specialized}} form of sack made of an extra tough canvas material and had metal rings on each end {{so they could}} attach to {{the arm of a}} railway mail bag crane. The body of the pouch was strengthened by leather bindings both at the top and bottom. A Registered Mail pouch came also with a <b>leather</b> <b>bottom</b> and had a special postal lock to secure the contents. A leather strap was secured around the center of the canvas body of the catcher pouch when it was readied to be snatched by a passing train's mail hook.|$|R
60|$|An old-times chamber it was, sure enough, {{and crowded}} {{with all kinds}} of trumpery. It looked like an {{infirmary}} for decayed and superannuated furniture; where everything diseased and disabled was sent to nurse, or to be forgotten. Or rather, it might have been taken for a general congress of old legitimate moveables, where every kind and country had a representative. No two chairs were alike: such high backs and low backs, and <b>leather</b> <b>bottoms</b> and worsted bottoms, and straw bottoms, and no bottoms; and cracked marble tables with curiously carved legs, holding balls in their claws, as though they were going to play at ninepins.|$|R
50|$|Six tablets made of yew wood {{are bound}} {{together}} along one edge with a leather thong, and tied shut {{at the top}} and <b>bottom</b> with two <b>leather</b> straps. Both sides of the inner four tablets, and the inner sides of the two outer tablets, have been hollowed out and filled with wax to form the writing surfaces of a wooden book of ten pages. Each wooden tablet is about 7.5 × 21.0 cm in size, and about 0.7 cm thick. The wax had partially melted when found, and some of the wax was damaged when the tablets were opened after discovery, but nevertheless much of the text is still legible.|$|R
50|$|A rower on a {{fixed seat}} is limited {{in the amount of}} power he can apply to the oars by the {{strength}} in his upper body and the distance he can pull the oars on each stroke. After riggers were added to the shell allowing the use of longer oars, rowers took advantage by taking longer strokes and using their legs during the stroke. At first, the athletes wore trousers with wear resistant <b>leather</b> <b>bottoms</b> covered in grease and the shells had concave, longitudinal seats. The athletes could then use their legs to slide along the seat, adding the power of their legs and letting them greatly lengthen the stroke. This eventually led to the modern sliding seat, mounted on rollers, which allows nearly frictionless movement of the rower's body.The first sliding seat was developed by George Warren of Toronto, a boat builder and famous decoy maker, who at the time was coach to world rowing champion Ned Hanlen. With the advent of the sliding seat Ned was able to greatly outperform his English and American counterparts.|$|R
500|$|In ancient Rome, the bikini-style bottom, a wrapped loincloth {{of cloth}} or leather, {{was called a}} subligar or subligaculum ("little binding underneath"), while a band of cloth or leather to support the breasts was called strophium or mamillare. The exercising bikini girls from Piazza Armenia wear subligaria, scanty briefs made as a dainty version of a man's perizoma, and a strophium band about the breasts, often {{referred}} to in literature as just fascia, which can mean any kind of bandage. Observation of artifacts and experiments shows bands had to be wrapped several times around the breasts, largely to flatten them in a style popular with flappers in the 1920s. These Greco-Roman breastbands may have flattened big breasts and padded small breasts to look bigger. Evidence suggests regular use. The [...] "bikini girls" [...] from Piazza Armenia, some of whom sport the braless look of the late 20th century, do not depict any propensity of such popularity in style. One <b>bottom,</b> made of <b>leather,</b> from Roman Britain was displayed at the Museum of London in 1998. There has been no evidence that these bikinis were for swimming or sun-bathing.|$|R
50|$|A {{refurbishment}} in {{the late}} 1970s/early 1980s started converting the six-seat compartment stock to 3+2-seat open saloons. At the same time, the red-brown horsehair seating and metal-framed cord overhead luggage racks were replaced with standard Mark 2 seats and metal racks. 2 x 25w. ceiling bulbs lit each compartment, and the partitions were initially painted in light cream: three publicity panels about 15 cm x 40 cm filled the space on the compartment walls between {{the top of the}} seats and the luggage racks - the central panel was originally a mirror, but as these proved dangerous in service they were soon replaced with normal advertising. The other fittings were a chain alarm-cord in a recess above and {{to one side of the}} door, and the door-lock itself, a simple spring-loaded slide: the slam-doors could be opened at speed, albeit at considerable risk to the passenger doing so. The door window could also be opened full-length into a recess in the door panel beneath, initially supported at the <b>bottom</b> by a <b>leather</b> strop, which was soon replaced by a metal friction-bar at the top, bearing on the side-rails - in general they were either closed or with a one- or two-inch opening. The flooring was a strong linoleum on wooded baulks: the linoleum was not present in the guards compartments, which together with the cabs were painted in a dark green. A mirror to a roof periscope facing along the length of the unit was fitted centrally to the guard's side of the rear compartment partition, together with a handle for the sweep=arm cleaner of the roof glasa. Underneath was a small worksurface about 2'x1', a swivel-chair screwed to the floor, and variously a short ladder for evacuating coaches, sometimes a medical cabinet, and a rail-shorting bar would be fixed to the side of the compartment. The driver's cab was fitted with one flap-down seat on each side: the driver occupied the left-hand position.|$|R
