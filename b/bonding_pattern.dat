40|$|In {{order to}} make the houses aesthetically more appealing, {{different}} <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> are used in bonded masonry. This is mainly done in brick masonry. In some cases, walls are left unplastered to expose the brickwork <b>bonded</b> with different <b>patterns.</b> This paper covers a detailed study on the performance of commonly used <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> in Sri Lanka such as English, Flemish and Rat-trap. The main parameters covered are the vertical load carrying capacity and the indoor thermal performance of different <b>bond</b> <b>patterns.</b> The vertical load carrying capacity was assessed by testing wall panels and found that the Flemish bond can give a better carrying capacity. Indoor thermal performance of different <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> was assessed by measuring indoor and outdoor temperature using physical models. Rat-trap bond shows better thermal performance compared to the others. With all these findings, now the house builders, architects and engineers can select the masonry <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> for their structures with the proper understanding of its performance...|$|R

40|$|Both {{prenatal}} and postnatal parental bonding (i. e., {{the affective}} tie from parent to child) have important effects on parental and child functioning. However, {{research on the}} continuity and correlates of parental bonding is lacking. Therefore, {{the goal of the}} present study was to examine the stability of bonding levels and to explore distinct <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> with a latent class analysis. Moreover, the correlates of these <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> in the parental-, child-, and contextual domain were studied. Levels of maternal (N = 370) and paternal (N = 292) bonding and potential correlates were assessed at 26 weeks of pregnancy, 6 months, and 24 months postpartum. Results showed moderate stability of bonding from pregnancy to toddlerhood. For both mothers and fathers, 4 distinct <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> were found. Parents with low <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> were characterized by increased anxiety and parenting stress, less partner support, less adaptive personality profiles, and children with difficult temperament. These findings indicate the importance of monitoring young children’s parents with poor levels of bonding as their <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> remain stable from pregnancy until toddlerhood and because those parents experience problems in multiple domains...|$|R
25|$|Finally, an {{individual}} strand may exhibit a mixed <b>bonding</b> <b>pattern,</b> with a parallel strand {{on one side}} and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since there are always numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always be careful in concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.|$|E
25|$|In a {{parallel}} arrangement, {{all of the}} N-termini of successive strands are oriented in the same direction; this orientation may be slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>pattern.</b> The dihedral angles (φ,ψ) are about (–120°,115°) in parallel sheets. It is rare to find less than five interacting parallel strands in a motif, suggesting that {{a smaller number of}} strands may be unstable, however it is also fundamentally more difficult for parallel β-sheets to form because strands with N and C termini aligned necessarily must be very distant in sequence. There is also evidence that parallel β-sheet may be more stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear to generally aggregate into β-sheet fibrils composed of primarily parallel β-sheet strands, where one would expect anti-parallel fibrils if anti-parallel were more stable.|$|E
25|$|Alpha sheet (also {{known as}} alpha pleated sheet or polar pleated sheet) is an {{atypical}} secondary structure in proteins, first proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. The hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>pattern</b> in an alpha sheet {{is similar to}} that of a beta sheet, but the orientation of the carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide bond units is distinctive; in a single alpha strand, all of the carbonyl groups are oriented in the same direction on one side of the pleat, and all of the amino groups are oriented in the same direction on the opposite side of the sheet. Thus the alpha sheet accumulates an inherent separation of electrostatic charge, with one edge of the sheet exposing negatively charged carbonyl groups and the opposite edge exposing positively charged amino groups. Unlike the alpha helix and beta sheet, the alpha sheet configuration does not require all component amino acid residues to lie within a single region of dihedral angles; instead, the alpha sheet contains residues of alternating dihedrals in the traditional right-handed (αR) and left-handed (αL) helical regions of Ramachandran space. Although the alpha sheet is only rarely observed in natural protein structures, it has been speculated to play a role in amyloid disease and it was found to be a stable form for amyloidogenic proteins in one set of molecular dynamics simulations. Alpha sheets have also been observed in X-ray crystallography structures of designed peptides.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulations of}} ion channel peptides alamethicin and melittin, solvated in methanol at 27 degrees C, were run with either regular alpha-helical starting structures (alamethicin, 1 ns; melittin 500 ps either {{with or without}} chloride counterions), or with the x-ray crystal coordinates of alamethicin as a starting structure (1 ns). The hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> and stabilities were characterized by analysis of the dynamics trajectories with specified hydrogen bond angle and distance criteria, and were compared with hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> and stabilities previously determined from high-resolution NMR structural analysis and amide hydrogen exchange measurements in methanol. The two alamethicin simulations rapidly converged to a persistent hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> {{with a high level}} of 3 (10) hydrogen bonding involving the amide NH's of residues 3, 4, 9, 15, and 18. The 3 (10) hydrogen bonds stabilizing amide NH's of residues C-terminal to P 2 and P 14 were previously proposed to explain their high amide exchange stabilities. The absence, or low levels of 3 (10) hydrogen bonds at the N-terminus or for A 15 NH, respectively, in the melittin simulations, is also consistent with interpretations from amide exchange analysis. Perturbation of helical hydrogen bonding in the residues before P 14 (Aib 10 -P 14, alamethicin; T 11 -P 14, melittin) was characterized in both peptides by variable hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> that included pi and gamma hydrogen bonds. The general agreement in hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> determined in the simulations and from spectroscopic analysis indicates that with suitable conditions (including solvent composition and counterions where required), local hydrogen-bonded secondary structure in helical peptides may be predicted from dynamics simulations from alpha-helical starting structures. Each peptide, particularly alamethicin, underwent some large amplitude structural fluctuations in which several hydrogen bonds were cooperatively broken. The recovery of the persistent hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> after these fluctuations demonstrates the stability of intramolecular hydrogen-bonded secondary structure in methanol (consistent with spectroscopic observations), and is promising for simulations on extended timescales to characterize the nature of the backbone fluctuations that underlie amide exchange from isolated helical polypeptides...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the topological properties of protein disulfide <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns.</b> First, {{a description of}} these patterns in terms of partially directed graphs is developed. The topologically distinct disulfide <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> available to a polypeptide chain containing n disulfide bonds are enumerated, and their symmetry and reducibil-ity properties are examined. The theoretical probabilities are calculated that a randomly chosen <b>pattern</b> of n <b>bonds</b> will have any combination of symmetry and reducibility properties, given that all patterns have equal probability of being chosen. Next, the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence and Brookhaven National Laboratories protein structure (PDB) databases are examined, and the occurrences of disulfide <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> in them are determined. The frequencies of symmetric and/or reducible patterns are found to exceed theoretical predictions based on equiprobable pattern selection. Kauzmann’s model, in which disulfide bonds form during random encounters as the chain assumes random coil conformations, finds that bonds {{are more likely to}} form with near neighbor cysteines than with remote cysteines. The observed frequencies of occurrence of disulfide pat-terns are found here to be virtually uncorrelated with the predictions of this alternative random bonding model. These results strongly suggest that disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> formation is not the result of random factors, but in-stead is a directed process...|$|R

30|$|MS data already {{indicated}} that the cysteine residues were oxidized and intra-molecular disulfide bonds could be formed between them. To prove it and reveal the possible disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> of NFAP 2 an RP-HPLC method was applied. It is known that RP-HPLC {{has the ability to}} correlate the retention behavior of peptides and proteins with their conformation. Based on this finding as well as on our experience on folding of P. chrysogenum antifungal protein PAF (Váradi et al. 2013), disulfide bond formation of NFAP 2 was followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Figure  5 c shows RP-HPLC elution profiles of folded NFAP 2 and PAF measured under the same conditions. NFAP 2 and PAF share structural similarities concerning their cationic character and the number of amino acids they are composed of. Both proteins are stabilized by three disulfide bridges. The common abcabc disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> has already been proven for PAF, and naturally folded PAF was shown to have much smaller retention time on RP-HPLC than any other variant possessing unnatural disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> (Batta et al. 2009; Váradi et al. 2013). Considering that NFAP 2 elutes from the reversed-phase column as early as naturally folded PAF, the same interlocking disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> (abcabc) seems to be the most probable for NFAP 2 as we predicted in silico (Fig.  2 c).|$|R
