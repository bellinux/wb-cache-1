A review by the National Toxicology Program concluded, [...] "There is no evidence of demonstrable risk for the development of breast cancer caused by the use of paraben-containing underarm cosmetics."

40|$|Abstract. <b>Butylparaben</b> {{is widely}} used as a {{bactericide}} and as an antimicrobial agent {{in the formation of}} personal care products (PCPs). Owing to a certain estrogenic activity, a possible relationship with breast cancer has been proved by many researchers. The removal efficiency of <b>butylparaben</b> in aqueous solutions was studied using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). These results indicate that the reaction rates for the ozonation of <b>butylparaben</b> in water are higher under the concentration of ozone 5 mg/L in alkaline condition. The original concentration of <b>butylparaben</b> almost degraded within 50, 30, and 20 min at ozone concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 mg/L, respectively at pH 11 runs. The ozonation imposed <b>butylparaben</b> with a time dependence that appeared to follow pseudo first-order kinetics.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of the {{chemical}} heterogeneity of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) on the release of model drug substances from hydrophilic matrix tablets. The hypothesis was that the release of drug substances could be influenced by possible interactions with HPMC batches having different chemical heterogeneity. The cloud point of the most heterogeneous batch was more affected by the model drug substances, methylparaben and <b>butylparaben,</b> and most by <b>butylparaben</b> with the lowest solubility. The different clouding behaviour was explained by the heterogeneously substituted batches being more associative and the more lipophilic <b>butylparaben</b> being able to interact more efficiently with the hydrophobic HPMC transient crosslinks that formed. Interestingly, tablet compositions of the heterogeneously substituted HPMC batches released the more soluble methylparaben at lower rates than <b>butylparaben.</b> The explanation is that the hydrophobic HPMC interactions with <b>butylparaben</b> made the gel of the tablet less hydrated and more fragile and therefore more affected by erosional stresses. In contrast, drug release from compositions consisting of the more homogeneously substituted batches was affected to a minor extent by the drugs and was very robust within the experimental variations.

40|$|<b>Butylparaben</b> (Butyl {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid) is {{a widely}} used cosmetic and pharmaceutical preservative that has been recently shown to induce oxidative stress and have endocrine disrupting effects in rodents, and promote adipocyte conversion of human adipose cells. Embryonic development is extremely sensitive to oxidative stress due to changes in cell growth, development and differentiation that occur during this life stage. Fluctuations in redox potentials play critical roles in normal embryonic development by guiding these cell signaling, cell-fate decisions and apoptosis. The most prevalent endogenous antioxidant that defends against oxidative stress is glutathione (GSH), which scavenges reactive oxygen species. The low antioxidant capacity of pancreatic beta cells suggests that they are sensitive target tissues of oxidative stress; this {{has yet to be}} investigated during embryonic development. Here, we aim to 1) determine whether embryonic exposure to <b>butylparaben</b> prompts structural and functional changes in the developing endocrine pancreas and 2) determine whether oxidative stress may be involved.

40|$|Background: Paraben {{exposure}} occurs everyday to {{most people}} unknowingly. Parabens are present in most personal care products in varying amounts. Presently, parabens are not listed as endocrine disruptors; however, some research has shown parabens associated with decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The chemical and adsorption mechanism for parabens in association with thyroid hormones is not well understood.

Methodology: The selected study variables were analyzed using SAS version 9. 2. Data were obtained from the 2007 - 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Analyses were performed separately for adolescent females (12 - 19) and adult females (20 +). Weighted means were performed for the main independent and dependent variables of interest stratified by race/ethnicity groups and by smoking status. Independent samples t-test and ANOVA was used to test significance of differences of weighted means. Weighted bivariate linear regression was performed for each dependent variable (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone [TSH], Triiodothyronine [T 3], and Thyroxine [T 4]) regressed on <b>butylparaben.</b> Weighted multiple linear regressions were performed and parameter estimates with 95 % confidence intervals were used to ascertain the measure of effect.

Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a retrovirus {{that can lead}} to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fall, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. â¢ As of January 2006, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first identified on December 1, 1981, {{making it one of the}} most destructive pandemics in recorded history. Pheroid technology is a patented delivery system that consists of both plant and essential fatty acids. It is often confused with lipid-based delivery system. Although there are some similarities, Pheroidâ¢ technology owns its advantages in terms of absorption and/or efficacy of pharmacologically active compounds and other useful molecules. The Pheroid structure can be manipulated in terms of morphology, structure, size and function. The effectiveness of Pheroid technology has been illustrated by several national and international clinical trials with products based on this technology. Pro-Pheroid production is similar to that of Pheroid production, except that no aqueous phase is introduced; instead, the active compounds are dissolved in the oil phase. This study was conducted to determine the stability of both nevirapine and butyiparaben in the pro-Pheroid delivery system as well as the preservative efficacy of <b>butylparaben.</b> High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the stability of nevirapine and <b>butylparaben</b> in pro-Pheroid. The formulation was stored under controlled conditions, i. e. 5 Â°C, 25 Â°C + 60 % RH, 30 Â°C + 65 % RH and 40 Â°C + 75 % RH, for three months. The accelerated stability study was performed according to ICH guidelines. The preservative efficacy study was done by the EnviroCare Laboratory according to international specifications. The various studies conducted on nevirapine in pro-Pheroid to determine the stability showed that nevirapine could successfully be formulated in the pro-Pheroid system and that <b>butylparaben</b> is an effective preservative in the formulation. It is finally concluded that before nevirapine in pro-Pheroid is further formulated into viable products, the following issues will have to be addressed: â¢	The pro-Pheroid manufacturing process should be assessed and validated to ensure batch to batch uniformity. â¢	In order to establish a sound analytical method, stability of the pro-Pheroid system (without the addition of pharmaceutical actives) should be evaluated over a period of at least six months. â¢	The specific UV detection wavelengths of both nevirapine and <b>butylparaben</b> should be assessed and validated to get the optimum wavelength for the HPLC assay analysis to ensure the integrity of the results obtained. The physical properties (color, smell and taste) of the pro-Pheroid system need to be addressed to make the product acceptable to the consumer. Master...|$|E
