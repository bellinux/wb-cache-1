The founding editor of Acta Crystallographica was P. P. Ewald, who wrote in the preface to the first issue [...] Acta Crystallographica is intended to offer a central place for publication and discussion of all research in this vast and ever-expanding field. It borders, naturally, on pure physics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, technology and also on mathematics, but is distinguished by being concerned with the methods and results of investigating the arrangement of atoms in matter, particularly when that arrangement has regular features. P. P. Ewald [...] A steady {{increase in the number of}} submitted papers led to the journal being split into Section A, covering fundamental and theoretical studies, and Section B, dedicated to reports of structures, in 1968, together with a new journal, the Journal of Applied Crystallography. In 1983, Section C, devoted to the crystal structures of small molecules, was added, with Section B now focusing on biological, chemical, mineralogical and metallurgical crystallography. [...] The rapid expansion in <b>biological</b> <b>crystallography</b> led to the launch of Section D in 1993. The journals launched online versions in 1999, and in 2000 the journals began to provide electronic article submission and subscription access online. This was followed by the launch of an online-only journal, Section E, for brief reports of new small-molecule structures, in 2001; this journal became fully open access in 2008. A second online-only journal, Section F, dedicated to short reports of macromolecular structures and reports on their crystallization, followed in 2005.

40|$|Abstract | India has a {{distinguished}} tradition in crystallography and structural biology. However, <b>biological</b> macromolecular <b>crystallography</b> {{in the country}} has had a somewhat delayed start on account of paucity of adequate funds and insufficient interactions between crystallographers and biochemists. Preliminary results in the area {{began to appear in}} the early eighties. The support provided by the Department of Science & Technology in the mid eighties under its thrust area programme for macromolecular crystallographic studies at the Molecular Biophysics Unit of the Indian Institute of Science gave a major impetus to work in the area. The Bangalore centre also came to be recognised as a national nucleus {{for the development of the}} area in the country. Since then, over the years, <b>biological</b> macromolecular <b>crystallography</b> has grown into a major activity in India encompassing nearly 20 institutions and close to twice as many research groups. It is also now at the centre stage of modern biological research in India. The problems addressed by biological crystallographers in the country span a wide spectrum and their efforts have made considerable international impact.

The high brightness and stability characteristics of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, along with the low emittance and long straight sections to accommodate insertion devices present in third generation synchrotrons like the ALS, lead to several advantages in the field of macromolecular crystallography. We are presently constructing macromolecular Crystallography Facility at the ALS which is optimized for user-friendliness and high-throughput data collection, with advanced capabilities for MAD and Laue experiments.

These coefficients were evaluated against an existing similarity metric developed for crystallization, the C 6 metric, using both virtual crystallization screens and by comparison of two related 1, 536 -cocktail high-throughput crystallization screens. Hierarchical clustering was employed to visualize one of these screens and the crystallization results from an exopolyphosphatase-related protein from Bacteroides fragilis, (BfR 192) overlaid on this clustering.

40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{challenges}} of crystallization and the size limitations of NMR, {{it has long been}} hoped that single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) would eventually yield atomically interpretable reconstructions. For the most favorable class of specimens (large icosahedral viruses), one of the key obstacles is curvature of the Ewald sphere, which leads to a breakdown of the projection theorem used by conventional 3 D reconstruction programs. Here an iterative refinement reconstruction algorithm, Prec, is described that overcomes this limitation by averaging information from images recorded from different points of view, as are present in typical micrographs. Prec was implemented in the popular software packages IMIRS, EMAN, and Bsoft. In preliminary tests with both simple and multi-slice simulated images, Prec overcame the curvature problem even in the presence of noise. Prec was then used to refine the three recently published, ~ 4 Å resolution, icosahedral virus reconstructions from experimental cryo-EM images, but unfortunately no significant improvements in resolution were realized.

Motivated by the need of a new approach to reveal structures that are currently not feasible by these traditional techniques, this thesis has developed a uniquely designed ultrafast multiple-mode multiple-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy (MDVS) to conquer the limitations of traditional methods. The MDVS technique has also been applied to study molecular structures under various condensed phases, and facilitate the understanding of various chemical mechanisms in this thesis.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Crystallographic {{methods for}} protein {{structure}} determination are well established and have provided valuable {{insight into the}} workings of the <b>biological</b> world. X-ray <b>crystallography</b> of three dimensional crystals has benefited from the development of high throughput screening methods, but the method still requires the production of large well ordered crystals. Crystal screening and optimization is an extremely time consuming bottleneck and many proteins, often of high biological interest, are simply not able to be crystallized. Electron crystallography of two dimensional crystals is a much more limited method applicable only to extremely thin two-dimensional crystals, usually composed of protein and lipid. This method has provided insight into the structures and protein-lipid interactions of some integral membrane proteins but is extremely low throughput and not broadly applicable. This work presents a new method for protein structure determination which is essentially a hybrid of these two methods. A focused electron beam is diffracted by very small three dimensional protein microcrystals allowing for diffraction data to be collected from crystals at least six orders of magnitude smaller than those used for traditional X-ray crystallography. This method allows data collection and subsequent structure determination using crystals that would be considered `initial hits' in a crystallization screen and would normally require a great deal of optimization before yielding data for structure determination. As proof of principle the structure of hen egg white lysozyme determined to 3. 0 Å resolution by microcrystal electron diffraction is presented. The procedures for data collection are detailed as well as an explanation of new software developed for processing the resulting data and possible future refinements and improvements to the technique. With further refinement microcrystal electron diffraction may prove useful for many proteins that are currently considered intractable because of their failure to form large well ordered three dimensional crystals...|$|R

It can provide insights into Precambrian <b>biological</b> process. The <b>crystallography</b> and microstructures of magnetite in BIF have been poorly studied due to its simple chemical composition. Here, we report an integrated crystallographic and geochemical study on various magnetites from four BIFs of 2500 to 2200 million-year-old for a better understanding on their geneses and alterations. Euhedral magnetite crystals from the Dales Gorge and Kuruman BIFs all show pure and homogeneous colors in their EBSD phase, Euler and IPF maps, suggesting they are well crystallized and devoid of inclusions or fractures. These crystals are recognized as silician magnetite with appreciable structural Si (ave. 1. 22 and 2. 05 wt% respectively) but rare Al (ave. 0. 27 and < 0. 05 wt% respectively). They likely precipitated in a reduced and Si-rich environment and were not subjected to later redox alterations. By contrast, irregularly shaped massive magnetite from the 2500 Ma Wutai BIF contains inclusions and/or fractures as revealed by numerous dark areas in its phase map. Such magnetite contains considerable structural Al (ave. 1. 51 wt%) but little Si (ave. 0. 07 wt%), suggesting a terrestrial contribution. Magnetite from the 2200 Ma Lüliang BIF commonly contains chert inclusions and fractures and has been partially oxidized to hematite/maghemite. Hematite preferentially occurs along the fractures or edges of magnetite crystals, implying a secondary oxidation with possible fluid percolation. It contains Al (ave. 0. 19 wt%) and Si (ave. 0. 505 wt%) in a range between that for the Wutai and Kuruman/Dales Gorge magnetites. We suggest primary features of magnetite from the Wutai and Lüliang BIFs have been obliterated in environments with increased detrital inputs, owing to oxygenation-enhanced continental weathering during or after the Great Oxidation Event. For all BIFs, the magnetite that coexists with carbonates contains much higher trace elements (Al, Mn, Ba, Ti and V) than that coexists with oxides. The former might {{have been influenced by}} its surrounding diagenetic to metamorphic carbonates. The implications of these findings suggest only the well crystallized euhedral magnetite coexists with oxides may retain the signatures of BIF’s depositional environments...|$|R

This work is concerned with an implementation of a DIC microscope containing a 4 -f system at its core with a programmable SLM placed at the frequency plane of the imaging system that allows for employing Fourier pair transforms for wavefront manipulation. This configuration of microscope provides a convenient way to perform both wavefront shearing with quantifiable arbitrary shear amount and direction as well as phase stepping interferometry by programming the SLM with a series of numerically generated patterns and digitally capturing interferograms for each step which are then used to calculate the objects phase gradient map. Wavefront shearing is performed by generating a pattern for the SLM where two phase ramp patterns with opposite slopes are interleaved through a random selection process with uniform distribution in order to mimic the simultaneous presence of the ramps on the same plane. The theoretical treatment accompanied by simulations and experimental results and discussion are presented in this work...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{studies of}} {{proteins}} are crucial {{for a more}} detailed view of the world around us. The focus of biochemical studies can vary, from a complex mammalian system to a more simple viral entity, but the same methods and principles apply. In biochemistry one rely on both in vitro and in vivo analyses to understand <b>biological</b> processes. Protein <b>crystallography</b> has since the late 1950 s been an additional important tool. By visualizing the structures of molecules involved in a biological process one can truly comprehend the molecular mechanisms of an organism or cell at the chemical level. This thesis includes structural biochemical work in combination with mutational and functional studies of proteins from both human and virus. Human tetraspanins are integral membrane proteins grouped by their conserved structural features. Many of them have been shown to regulate cell migration, fusion, and signalling in the cell by functioning as organizers of multi-molecular membrane complexes. Several tetraspanins are also implicated in different forms of human cancers. How tetraspanins perform their function is still not known at the molecular level and today very little structural data exist on complete tetraspanin proteins. Structural biochemical studies require mg quantities of purified protein, something that is not easily obtained for membrane proteins. This thesis includes a family-wide approach to achieve full-length tetraspanins for biochemical studies. To facilitate this process a GFP-based optimization scheme for production and purification of membrane proteins in E. coli and S. cerevisiae has been applied. By utilizing this approach, we identified 8 human tetraspanins that can be produced and isolated from either E. coli or S. cerevisiae, and in one case using either system. The temperate bacteriophage P 2 is a virus, which can enter both the lytic and the lysogenic cycle upon infection of its host. The outcome of the infection is regulated by and dependent on several proteins encoded by the viral genome. The immunity repressor P 2 and the Cox repressor direct the phage into either cycle. Integration and excision of the virus DNA requires the enzyme P 2 integrase. The work in this thesis presents high-resolution crystal structures of these key proteins from the regulation of lysogeny in bacteriophage P 2. By using a crystallographic approach in combination with mutational studies, key characteristics of these three proteins are presented.   At the time of the doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 48 - 51). Since Meischer's initial {{discovery of}} DNA in 1869, researchers {{have worked to}} understand the structure and function of this fundamental <b>biological</b> molecule. X-ray <b>crystallography</b> has allowed scientists to examine the structure of DNA and the mechanism of DNA interactions with proteins and small molecules at atomic resolution. Numerous crystal structures of different DNA sequences, structures, and complexes have been solved that show that DNA can take {{on a variety of}} different conformations to carry out its biological functions in the cell. Despite this wealth of structural information, many questions remain unanswered. In this two-part study, the principles of x-ray crystallography are applied in an effort to determine the structure of DNA complexes from two different biological pathways. In the first system, the interplay between the NF-??B and IRF families of transcription factors within the innate immune response is explored. The NF-??B p 50 homodimer {{is a member of the}} NF-??B family that is constitutively expressed in the cell. It is known to bind ??B DNA sequences in the nucleus and act as a competitive repressor of ??B-driven transcription. Recent studies have described a novel p 50 DNA binding mechanism in the nucleus in which p 50 binds to G-IRE DNA sequences and represses the transcription of interferon response genes. A high-resolution structural model is needed to better understand this mechanism of transcriptional cross regulation in the nucleus. p 50 :G-IRE complexes were screened for crystallization and several different forms of single complex co-crystals were obtained and tested for diffraction. All crystals tested produced very little and poor diffraction. Future studies are being developed to carry out biophysical characterization on these complexes. In the second system, we explored the interactions between a series of peptide inhibitors and an intermediate of DNA recombination, the Holliday Junction (HJ). There are a series of steps during recombination including DNA cleavage, strand exchange, and ligation to generate the four-armed DNA structure known as the Holliday junction. HJs are targets for the development of inhibitors that are capable of blocking the resolution of the HJ. Researchers in the Segall Laboratory at SDSU have developed several inhibitors that bind HJs and exhibit potent antibacterial properties. However, the precise chemical mechanism by which these interactions occur is unknown. Multiple crystal forms containing the DNA:inhibitor complex have been crystallized and exhibit diffraction to a resolution of 6 - 8 ?? but exhibit high mosaicity, indicating there is a high amount of disorder within the crystals probably due to heterogeneity in our crystal sample. The presence of the peptide within the crystal has been confirmed by excision assay. Crystals are being optimized for further analysis and experiments are being designed to better understand the heterogeneity within the crystals...|$|R
