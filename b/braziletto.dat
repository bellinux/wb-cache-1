2500|$|On 30 August Captain Warren, his {{officers}} and crew went before a court martial on [...] at Port Royal. The court martial ruled that the wrecking was {{probably due to the}} master mistaking <b>Braziletto</b> Hill for Portland Point and so setting a wrong course. The court martial board warned Warren and the master to be more careful in the future and to pay closer attention to the courses they steered and the distances they had covered.|$|E
6000|$|At South Bay we {{came upon}} a grassy {{clearing}} larger than usual, near a bright stream; its pottery and charred wood showed {{the site of the}} Spanish barracoon destroyed by the British in 1840. During the last seven years the [...] "patriarchal institution" [...] has become extinct, and the old slavers who have at times touched at the island, have left it empty-handed. Corisco had long been celebrated for cam-wood, a hard and ponderous growth, yielding a better red than Brazil or <b>Braziletto,</b> alias Brazilete (Brasilettia, De Cand.) one of the Eucæsalpinieæ, a congener of C. Echinata, which produces the Brazil-wood or Pernambuco-wood of commerce. In 1679, the Hollander Governor-General of Minas sent some forty whites to cultivate [...] "Indian wheat and other sort of corn and plants of Guinea." [...] The design was to supply the Dutch West Indian Company's ships with grain and vegetables, especially bananas, which grow admirably; I heard that there are fifteen varieties upon this dot of dry land. Thus the crews would not waste time and money at Cape Lopez and the Portuguese islands. The Dutch colonists began by setting up a factory in a turf redoubt, armed with iron guns, [...] "the better to secure themselves from any surprise or assault of the few natives, who are a sort of wild and mischievous blacks." [...] The plantation was successful, but the bad climate and noxious gases from the newly turned ground, combined with over-exertion, soon killed some seventeen out of the forty; and the remainder, who also suffered from malignant distempers, razed their buildings and returned to the Gold Coast. When the Crown of Spain once more took possession of Fernando Po, it appointed a Governor for Corisco, but no establishment was maintained there. To its credit be it said, there was not much interference with the Protestant mission; public preaching was forbidden pro formâ in 1860, but no notice was taken of [...] "passive resistance." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{settlers}} {{ran into}} trouble {{before they even}} landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of Spanish Wells. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held {{every year for the}} next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others. More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. This time it was the sympathetic Puritans of New England who rallied to their cause and collected £800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive. The Eleutheran people later showed their thankfulness by sending shiploads of the extremely valuable <b>Braziletto</b> wood to Boston, with instructions to sell it and donate the proceeds to Harvard University.|$|E
5000|$|In Seixas v. Woods (1804), a {{contract}} {{was made for}} the delivery of [...] "braziletto wood," [...] {{and it was so}} advertised and described in the invoice. A delivery was made of an article known as [...] "peachum wood," [...] much inferior in quality. There was no evidence of fraud or an express warranty, and it was held that an action on the case would not lie, [...] "for selling one wood for the other." [...] Kent, Chancellor, said : [...] "If upon a sale there be neither warranty nor deceit, the purchaser purchases at his peril[...] [...] [...] The mentioning the wood as <b>braziletto</b> wood in the bill of parcels, and in the advertisement some days previous to the sale, did not amount to a warranty to the plaintiffs. To make an affirmation {{at the time of the}} sale a warranty, it must appear by the evidence to be so intended, and not to have been a mere matter of judgment or opinion, and of which the defendant had no particular knowledge. Here it is admitted the defendant was equally ignorant with the plaintiffs, and could have had no such intention." ...|$|E
