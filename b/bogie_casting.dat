40|$|The bogie made of Grade B+ {{steel is}} one of the most {{important}} parts of heavy haul trains. Some accidents were found to be the result of fracture failure of the bogies. It is very important to find the reason why the fracture failure occurred. Because Al was added for the final deoxidation during the smelting process of the Grade B+Steel, residual Al existed to some extent in the castings. High residual Al content in the <b>bogie</b> <b>casting</b> was presumed to be the reason for the fracture. In this work, the influence of residual Al content in the range of 0. 015 wt. % to 0. 3 wt. % on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the Grade B+ Steel was studied. The experimental results showed that when the residual Al content is between 0. 02 wt. % and 0. 20 wt. %, the mechanical properties of the steel meet the requirements of technical specification for heavy haul train parts, and the fracture is typical plastic fractures. If the residual Al content is less than 0. 02 wt. %, the microstructures are coarse, and the mechanical properties can not meet the demand of bogie steel castings. When the residual Al content is more than 0. 2 wt. %, the elongation, reduction of area, and low-temperature impact energy markedly deteriorate. The fracture mode then changes from plastic fracture to cleavage brittle fracture. Therefore, the amount of Al addition for the final deoxidation during the smelting process must be strictly controlled. The optimum addition amount needs to be controlled within the range of 0. 02 wt. % to 0. 20 wt. % for the Grade B+Steel...|$|E
50|$|Bogies: Co-Co <b>cast</b> <b>bogies</b> (Alco {{asymmetric}} trimountâ€”shared with WDM-2, WAM-4).|$|R
50|$|Locomotives EF10 30 to 33 {{continued}} {{with the same}} welded angular body design, but used <b>cast</b> <b>bogie</b> frames.|$|R
50|$|The QN series {{generally}} ran on plateframe bogies, although wagons 1 and 116 {{were spotted}} with <b>cast</b> <b>bogies</b> {{in the late}} 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Four UB vans were recoded to UF during 1961. They {{were placed}} on <b>cast</b> <b>bogies</b> capable of higher speeds, a result of {{internal}} springing that reduced vibrations. The four vans were 15, 17, 53 and 55.|$|R
50|$|Between 1951 and 1953, Henschel and Son built twenty for Rhodesia Railways, their 19th class, {{numbered}} in {{the range}} from 316 to 335. They had tenders similar to the SAR Torpedo type, but with plate frame <b>bogies</b> instead of <b>cast</b> frame Buckeye <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each <b>bogie</b> were <b>cast</b> in mono-block format, each {{surrounded by}} two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings.|$|R
50|$|The {{second set}} of locos were rebogied at various depots with the regeared <b>Cast</b> <b>bogie</b> frame type 'CP7 Bogie' (bogies from the English Electric Deltics, Class 50 and Class 37s are largely {{interchangeable}} with only modification to traction motor gearing to 80 mph and access step positions needing alteration between the classes), the fuel capacity was doubled (by using the redundant train heating boiler water tanks) but no other changes were made.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to find a better {{solution}} for ride quality, the Railways converted 742Z from a four-wheeled van to a bogie guards van. It featured <b>cast</b> <b>bogies</b> with outside spring dampers, and entered service as 742ZZ. It was theorised that the extra springs between axles and bogie, as well as between bogie and frame, would help to reduce vertical forces experienced due to less than ideal track geometry, though {{it is not clear how}} the fitting of bogies would have helped with coupler slack issues.|$|R
50|$|The {{diesel engines}} were direct coupled to a torque {{converter}}, the output from the torque converter was {{then transferred to}} a Spicer model 8 final drive unit mounted on the inner axle of each bogie via a propeller shaft. The <b>bogies</b> were of <b>cast</b> steel construction & were constructed by AE Goodwin. Coil spring suspension was fitted to both the axleboxes & bolster and the axles were fitted with roller bearings. Each engine also drove 24 Volt DC & 120 Volt DC generators, {{as well as an}} air compressor for the air brakes. Engine cooling was by two vertically mounted radiators contained in the body in a small compartment separating the two main passenger compartments. The air was drawn in through louvres in the walls and exhausted through the roof by thermostatically controlled fans.|$|R
50|$|This {{class was}} {{actually}} {{variant of the}} WAP-4 design where Co-Co Flexicoil Mark 1 <b>cast</b> <b>bogies</b> of the usual WAP4 was replaced by Fabricated Flexicoil Mark IV bogies. All other specifications were same as WAP4. WAP-1 unit no. 22212 {{was the first to}} be rebuilt into a WAP-6. It was provided with Flexicoil bogies and other upgrades. Then it was rebuilt into WAP-4. Later, more WAP-1 units were re-geared and provided with high-adhesion fabricated bogies (Flexicoil Mark IV) which are somewhat similar to ALCO hi-adhesion bogies. They were intended to reach 140 km/h but failed to do so in trials and were restricted at 105 km/h. Two units,i.e., 22406 and 22408 are upgraded with better wheel-sets. This class was an unsuccessful one. All have been converted back as WAP-4. All were homed at Asansol(ASN) shed but after conversion reallocated to Howrah (HWH)shed.|$|R
50|$|By the 1890s, {{the goods}} rolling stock {{on the narrow}} gauge part of the RAR {{consisted}} mainly of (1) a four-wheeled wagon utilising a standard wooden underframe with a cast iron double bearing assembly attached under each side to accommodate the wheelsets; and (2) a channel framed <b>bogie</b> wagon with <b>cast</b> iron <b>bogie</b> frames. There were at least three designs of bogie carriage in use at this time, namely the original 'knifeboard' open pattern, a closed 1st/2nd class composite with diagonal body planking and a 'curly roofed' suprintendent saloon. There were also a number of Bagnall and Fowler bogie wagons {{left over from the}} abortive Suakin-Berber campaign. By World War One, the closed seven plank bogie wagon using the type (2) chassis above was the most ubiquitous item of rolling stock and a small number of these even remained on site after the closure of the railway system. There were also seven narrow gauge passenger coaches supplied by Bristol Carriage & Wagon Co. in 1917 but these, along with all other narrow gauge passenger stock, are thought to have been disposed of in 1923.|$|R
