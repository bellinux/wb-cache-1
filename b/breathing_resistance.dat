40|$|Abstract: Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} is highly prevalent in childhood obesity. Two recent cross-sectional {{studies have demonstrated}} an independent association between the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and the metabolic syndrome. A limited {{number of studies have}} also addressed the correlation between sleep-disordered <b>breathing</b> and insulin <b>resistance,</b> the core factor of the metabolic syndrome. Cross-sectional reports in modestly obese children are in favor of an association between sleep apnea and insulin resistance. However, these findings were not confirmed in studies of normal-weight children and of morbidly obese children. Only one out of three treatment studies before and after adenotonsillectomy confirmed the association between sleep apnea and insulin resistance, but only in obese children. Although statistical power issues and differences in patient characteristics might partially explain these contradicting results, the evidence to date is far from establishing a causal link between sleep-disordered <b>breathing</b> and insulin <b>resistance.</b> Longitudinal studies and randomized control trials are therefore warranted to investigate a possible causal link between sleep-disordered <b>breathing</b> and insulin <b>resistance...</b>|$|R

Recently, mining rescue services in deep coal mines have been more and more often conducted under conditions of an irrespirable mine atmosphere containing high concentrations of carbon monoxide, but at the same time containing sufficient oxygen for the breathing physiology of mine rescuer (for example, interventions dealing with the disposal of machinery under conditions of occurrence of endogenous mining fire of coal). This fact, after a long time, has resumed again the discussion of miners' rescue experts about whether it would be possible to implement the use of breathing apparatuses filtrating carbon monoxide into practice by the Mining Rescue Services of the Czech Republic in order to ensure a sufficient level of safety for mining rescuers even in an unexpected and rapid decline of the oxygen amount in the mine air at the site of the mine rescue service. The benefit of the breathing apparatuses filtrating carbon monoxide is their significantly lower weight, long protection period and also significantly smaller dimensions and design variability of the device.

A joint research effort between Duke University and the University of Bath has verified the feasibility in laboratory trials of an alternative carbon dioxide removal method that intimately mixes seawater with breathing circuit gases within a packed bed of Dixon rings. Based on the results of these laboratory trials, two multi-path scrubber prototypes were designed and fabricated for unmanned testing. In March 2013, the hyperbaric performance of these prototype scrubbers was characterized over a wide range of gas and water flow rates when operating the scrubbers in counter-current (water flowing in the opposite direction as gas flow) and co-current (water flowing {{in the same direction as}} gas flow) fashion. Significant findings from these tests included the following: Both scrubber prototypes were found to be capable of delivering exit CO 2 levels below 0. 5 vol% (surface equivalent) at respiratory rates up to 22. 5 liters per minute and at depths ranging from 0 to 40 meters of seawater (MSW). Negligible collateral O 2 absorption was observed at surface pressure (exit O 2 levels were typically above 20. 2 vol%), and exit O 2 levels were typically above 18. 4 % during testing at 10 MSW.

40|$|Background: Positive expiratory {{pressure}} (PEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are {{two forms of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>breathing</b> used in spontaneously breathing patients. With a threshold resistor or a flow resistor, both PEP and CPAP provide a positive (elevated) pressure level during the expiratory phase. With PEP, inspiratory pressure is negative, i. e. lower than ambient air pressure, as during a normal inspiration, but with CPAP, the inspiratory pressure is positive, i. e. higher than ambient air pressure. Methods: This thesis is based on four separate studies in which four different breathing devices, a PEP-bottle (threshold resistor device), a PEP-mask (flow resistor device), a threshold resistor CPAP and a flow resistor device were investigated. Paper I, II and III are based on studies in healthy volunteers. Paper IV is a bench study performed in a hypobaric chamber. Paper I examined differences between two PEP devices, the PEP-bottle and the PEP-mask. Paper II evaluated {{the performance of a}} flow resistor CPAP device, (Boussignac CPAP). Paper III investigated the effect of two PEP-devices, a PEP-bottle and a PEP-mask and two CPAP devices, a threshold resistor CPAP and a flow resistor CPAP, on inspiratory capacity (IC). In paper IV, the effect of changes in ambient pressure on preset CPAP levels in two different CPAP devices was compared. Results: With the PEP bottle, both expiration and inspiration began with a zero-flow period during which airway pressure changed rapidly. With the PEP-mask, the zero-flow period was very short and the change in airway pressure almost non-existent (paper I). During normal breathing with the Boussignac CPAP, changes in airway pressure were never large enough to reduce airway pressure below zero. During forced breathing, as airflow increased, both the drop in inspiratory airway pressure and the increase in expiratory airway pressure were potentiated (paper II). IC decreased significantly with three of the breathing devices, the PEP-mask and the two CPAP devices (paper III). With the threshold resistor CPAP, measured pressure levels were close to the preset CPAP level. With the flow resistor CPAP, as the altitude increased CPAP produced pressure levels increased (paper IV). Conclusion: The effect on airway pressure, airflow, IC and the effect of changes in ambient air pressure differ between different kinds of <b>resistance</b> <b>breathing</b> devices.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Breathing {{exercises}} {{with positive}} expiratory pressure (PEP) {{are used to}} improve pulmonary function and airway clearance. Different PEP devices are available, {{but there have been}} no studies that describe the pressure generated by different resistors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare pressures generated from the proprietary resistor components of 4 commercial flow-dependent PEP valves with all other parameters kept constant. METHODS: Resistors from 4 flow-regulated PEP devices (Pep/Rmt system, Wellspect HealthCare; Pipe P breathing exerciser, Koo Medical Equipment; Mini-PEP, Philips Respironics [including resistors by Rüsch]; and 15 -mm endo-adapter, VBM Medizintechnik) were tested randomly by a blinded tester at constant flows of 10 and 18 L/min from an external gas system. All resistors were tested 3 times. RESULTS: Resistors with a similar diameter produced statistically significant different pressures at the same flow. The differences were smaller when the flow was 10 L/min compared with 18 L/min. The differences were also smaller when the diameter of the resistor was increased. The pressures produced by the 4 resistors of the same size were all significantly different when measuring 1. 5 - and 2. 0 -mm resistors at a flow of 10 L/min and 2. 0 -mm resistors at a flow of 18 L/min (P <. 001). There were no significant differences between any of the resistors when testing sizes of 4. 5 and 5. 0 mm at either flow. The Mini-PEP and adapter resistors gave the highest pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Pressures generated by the different proprietary resistor components of 4 commercial PEP devices were not comparable, even though the diameter of the resistors is reported to be the same. The pressures generated were significantly different, particularly when using small-diameter resistors at a high flow. Therefore, the resistors may not be interchangeable.
