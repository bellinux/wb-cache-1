2500|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in different sources using different methods, {{as well as the}} name or names cited. NBI measures <b>bridge</b> <b>length</b> between the [...] "backwalls of abutments" [...] or pavement grooves and the roadway width as [...] "the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails". The NRHP form was prepared by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and PennDOT, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.|$|E

50|$|Considering {{the fact}} that the width of the main channel does not exceed 3.5 km, and after making {{allowances}} for floods, a <b>bridge</b> <b>length</b> of 5 km was considered adequate. In October 1995, one year after the start of physical work, a <b>bridge</b> <b>length</b> of 5.63 km, instead of a flood-width of the river at 14 km, was finalised. This narrowing was essential to keep the overall project cost within economic viability. It has, however, required considerable river training work to keep the river under the bridge.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} matrix {{strength}} on the notched and unnotched tensile properties {{of a family}} of porous-matrix oxide composites are examined both experimentally and theoretically. Experi-ments are performed on three composites, distinguished from one another by the amount of binding alumina within the matrix. Increases in alumina concentration produce elevations in un-notched tensile and shear strengths, but the benefits are offset by an increase in notch sensitivity. The degree of notch sensitivity is rationalized {{on the basis of a}} model that accounts for interac-tions between notch tip tensile and shear bands. The model pre-dictions are cast in terms of the ratio of the notch length to a characteristic <b>bridging</b> <b>length</b> scale. These results, in turn, form the basis for a simple analytical formula for notched strength, accounting for effects of elastic anisotropy and finite sample size. The utility of this formula in predicting notched strength is assessed. Issues associated with bridging law shapes and bridg-ing length scales are addressed. The effect of alumina concen-tration on notch sensitivity is discussed in terms of its influence on the <b>bridging</b> <b>length</b> scale, dictated by the interplay between the unnotched tensile strength, the longitudinal Young’s modu-lus, the degree of in-plane elastic anisotropy, and the fracture energy. The net result is a decreasing <b>bridging</b> <b>length</b> scale and hence increasing notch sensitivity as the matrix is strengthened with alumina. I...|$|R

40|$|Traffic loading {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{variable}} parameters in a bridge reliability assessment. Its accurate assessment potentially offers large savings due to reduced bridge rehabilitation or replacement costs. It is frequently assumed that free-flowing traffic (incorporating dynamic effects) governs for short- to medium-length bridges, whilst congestion governs for longer bridges. In this paper, for a range of <b>bridge</b> <b>lengths</b> and load effects, several traffic congestion models are considered, including the most common in the literature, as well as a model based upon traffic micro-simulation. For the critical model, the dynamic ratio that would be required for free-flowing traffic to govern is determined. For a range of <b>bridge</b> <b>lengths,</b> these dynamic ratios are larger than would be expected, and thus the authors conclude that contrary to the common assumption, the governing form of traffic may be congested traffic...|$|R
