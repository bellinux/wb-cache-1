5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in <b>business</b> <b>confidence,</b> inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} recyclate not only {{supports}} high-quality recycling, {{but it can}} also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing, reusing and keeping products out of landfills. High-quality recycling can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected. Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to local governments, households, and businesses. Pursuing high-quality recycling can also provide consumer and <b>business</b> <b>confidence</b> in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that sector.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's GDP {{growth rate}} for FY 2012–2013 was 3.3%, that was despite <b>business</b> <b>confidence</b> in Pakistan {{reaching}} a three-year high in May 2014 largely backed by increasing foreign reserves which crossed $15billion by mid-2014. Along with that, in May 2014 IMF claimed that Inflation {{has dropped to}} 13 per cent compared to 25% in 2008, foreign reserves are {{in a better position}} and the current account deficit has come down to 3 per cent of GDP for 2014. Standard & Poor's and Moody's Corporation changed Pakistan's ranking to stable outlook on the long-term rating.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} actually {{succeeded in}} generating a small surplus {{in the budget}} during {{the second quarter of}} 1994, mainly as a result of higher taxes, after running a deficit of 17 percent of GDP in the first quarter. The slowdown in government spending, a sharp loss in <b>business</b> <b>confidence,</b> and the resulting decline in economic activity reduced tax revenues, however. The fiscal crisis resulted in a decline in real GDP of 5 percent in 1994 after the economy had grown briskly in 1992 and 1993. Real wages also fell in 1994: average nominal wage increases of 65 percent were about 20 percent below the rate of consumer price inflation.|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has provided}} an attractive model for business service delivery. However, accountability aspects, mainly the {{monitoring of the}} execution of a service contract, liability assignment and dispute arbitration are still lacking. On the one hand, the traditional centralized monitoring and the trusted-third party (TTP) based arbitration solutions are not suitable for the distributed cloud environment. On the other hand, a decentralized solution also faces challenges in guaranteeing fairness, accuracy and sustainability. To address this issue, this paper firstly proposes an innovative service contract management scheme that facilitates the monitoring of the execution of a service contract in a peer-to-peer environment, inspired by the concept of blockchain in Bitcoin. Secondly, {{on top of the}} scheme it presents a novel dispute resolution protocol based on the Byzantine agreement and the commitment scheme. Thirdly, it identifies the optimal settings of the key parameters of the protocol through a set of experiments and scenario analysis, aiming to strike the balance of fairness, accuracy, incentive maximization for the honest arbiters and cost minimization for the overall arbitration process. With this approach, service participants can be held accountable in a truly distributed environment without the presence of a central authority, which increases <b>businesses</b> <b>confidence</b> on adopting cloud services. 8 page(s...|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s, {{the manner}} in which power is {{exercised}} in the management of a country's social and economic status resources for development emerged as Pakistan's foremost developmental problem. Corruption and political instabilities such as the insurgency in Balochistan and decade long armed conflict with the Taliban in Waziristan region resulted in reduction of <b>business</b> <b>confidence,</b> deterioration of economic growth, reduced public expenditure, poor delivery of public services, and undermining of the rule of law. The perceived security threat on the border with India has dominated Pakistan's culture and has led to the domination of military in politics, excessive spending on defense at the expense of social sectors, and the erosion of law and order.|$|E
25|$|Cavallo {{was called}} by President de la Rúa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, {{in the face of}} a {{weakened}} coalition government and two years of recession. He attempted to restore <b>business</b> <b>confidence</b> by renegotiating the external debt with the International Monetary Fund and with bondholders, but the growing country risk and spiraling put options by large investors and foreign holdings led to a bank run and a massive capital flight. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the corralito ("financial corral"). The anger of those Argentines with the means to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class protest termed the cacerolazo. Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the December 2001 riots. This critical situation finally forced Cavallo, and then de la Rúa, to resign.|$|E
25|$|GDP, long {{stuck at}} its 1973 level {{even with a}} growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. Fixed investment, {{depressed}} since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994. The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and <b>business</b> <b>confidence</b> and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).|$|E

A quantitative ANOVA analysis found that instrumental support factors (for example, money and tuition) overall were significant in predicting performance-based confidence, particularly for males. However, qualitative results showed that supportive parenting and confidence are not always correlated...|$|R
