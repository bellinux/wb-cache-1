50|$|The Meditation <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{rational}} moral comparison {{and proceeds}} to a frenzy of increasingly unlikely comparisons. While the satire <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pitch-perfect imitation of the kindly Boyles tone, it ends in a frantic, misanthropistic and misognynistic note of despair and nihilism. Also, while it <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hopeful call to self-examination, it moves eventually into a condemnation of all efforts at improvement.|$|R
5|$|W4 {{is found}} in Camarillo White Horses, a breed {{characterized}} by a white coat, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan. Like W1 and W3, horses {{with this type of}} dominant white may be pure white or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a missense mutation on Exon12.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} in Washington {{for more than}} two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chorale fantasia and {{ending in a}} closing chorale, as usually in his chorale cantatas, but with an unusual sequence of only one recitative and four arias, setting the poetic hymn stanzas. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of corno da caccia (Co) to support the chorale tune in the outer movements, two flauti traversi (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> biblical quotation for the vox Christi, Jesus speaking. A set of aria and recitative {{is followed}} by a chorus on another biblical quotation from the gospel, while an aria leads to the closing chorale. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. The duration of the cantata is given as 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN was {{launched}} on March 19, 1979, {{in time for}} the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> speech by then-Tennessee representative Al Gore. Upon its debut, only 3.5 million homes were wired for C-SPAN, and the network had just three employees. The second C-SPAN channel, C-SPAN2, followed on June 2, 1986 when the U.S. Senate permitted itself to be televised. C-SPAN3, the most recent expansion channel, began full-time operations on January 22, 2001, and shows other public policy and government-related live events on weekdays along with weekend historical programming. C-SPAN3 is the successor of a digital channel called C-SPAN Extra, which {{was launched}} in the Washington D.C. area in 1997, and televised live and recorded political events from 9:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{continued}} {{writing and}} publishing books on archaeology, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series of works following on from The Dawn of European Civilisation and The Aryans by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was The Most Ancient Near East (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background {{from which the}} spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by The Danube in Prehistory (1929) which examined the archaeology along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe {{believed that it was}} via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward in prehistory. The book introduced the concept of an archaeological culture to Britain from Germany, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.|$|E

In December, five more stations were opened, continuing service south of Fort Snelling to the Mall of America station. Two additional Blue Line stations opened in late 2009: a new northern terminus at Target Field and the American Boulevard station in Bloomington. Construction on the Green Line, which was initially designated as the Central Corridor, began in 2010. The line opened in its entirety in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Expansion {{sets are}} {{currently}} released in a two-set block, {{starting with a}} large set and ending with a smaller one three months later. Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards {{to a handful of}} particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 – 1994, Li Hongzhi {{traveled}} throughout China giving week-long {{seminars on}} Falun Gong's spiritual philosophy and exercises and meditation practices.

Later that year, Li left China and began teaching the practice overseas, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stop at the Chinese embassy in Paris in March 1995, followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.|$|E

On the contrary, the names of the male hairy black pithecanthropi while having an even number of syllables <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel and end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant; while the females of this species have an odd number of syllables in their names which <b>begin</b> always <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant and end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel.|$|R
5|$|Gaiman {{revisited}} Hell {{as depicted}} by Alan Moore in Swamp Thing, <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guest appearance by Jack Kirby's Etrigan the Demon in issue No. 4 (April 1989). The story introduces Hell's Hierarchy (as their entry is titled in Who's Who in the DC Universe), headed by Lucifer (who would spin off {{into his own}} series in 1999), Beelzebub (later adversary to Kid Eternity), and Azazel, whom Dream defeated later in the series. Dream visited the Justice League International in the following issue, No. 5 (May 1989). Although multiple mainstream DC characters appeared in the series throughout its run, such as Martian Manhunter and Scarecrow, {{this would not be}} the norm. Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, in issue No. 8 (August 1989).|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E

The Commissioning Program is now the longest-running commissioning program for wind band music in American history, and has produced works that have secured {{a place in the}} emerging band canon and have garnered critical acclaim, such as Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra.|$|E
