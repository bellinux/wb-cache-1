5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Thelephora palmata {{can be used}} for {{mushroom}} dyeing. Depending on the mordant used, colors ranging from blackish brown to dark grayish green to greenish brown can <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dyeing process; without a mordant, a light-brown color is produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{dihalide}} of silver is the difluoride, AgF2, which can <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride {{is often used}} to synthesize hydrofluorocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diet.|$|E

5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more readily available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside of {{the west side of the}} barn.|$|E
5|$|The {{neptunium}} carbides NpC, Np2C3, and NpC2 (tentative) {{have been}} reported, {{but have not}} characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel. NpC is a non-stoichiometric compound, and could be better labelled as NpCx (0.82 ≤ x ≤ 0.96). It may <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at 1400°C or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric arc furnace using a tungsten electrode. It reacts with excess carbon to form pure Np2C3. NpC2 is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660–2800°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diet.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> second {{inequality}} <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first inequality {{by replacing}} min with max and × with + and by reversing {{the direction of}} the inequality. <b>The</b> third inequality <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first by replacing the summation by the spectral radius. <b>The</b> fourth inequality <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first by taking each summand as a coefficient in a quadratic form. <b>The</b> fifth inequality <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first by replacing both outer summations by products, min by ×, × by +, and the nonnegative vectors a and b by nonnegative measurable functions f and g. The proofs of these inequalities are mysteriously diverse...|$|R
5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction can <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection {{is associated with}} a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it {{was decided}} to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Clinch River and steam from the K-25 power house. The thermal {{diffusion}} project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus fixed fee contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{smelting}} of {{lead and zinc}} ores. Manganese nodules found {{on the ocean floor}} contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{awarding}} the Victoria Cross may {{take place in}} two ways: One is through a recommendation by the Decorations and Commendations Advisory Committee, which {{is a part of}} the Department of National Defence and has six members, one appointed by the governor general and the rest by the chief of the Defence Staff. Alternatively, a field commander can submit a name for consideration, though permission must <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> governor general before the award can be presented. Recipients are entitled to receive an annuity from the federal Canadian Crown; per the Canadian gallantry awards order issued in January 2005, members of the Canadian Forces or those who joined the British forces while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland prior to 31 March 1949, after receiving the Victoria Cross, be granted C$3,000 each year. Previously, Canadians who were posthumously awarded the British Victoria Cross were given special headstones at their burial sites in Commonwealth War Graves and other cemeteries.|$|E
5|$|Zombiepowder. {{is set in}} a western-themed {{environment}} with inconsistent levels of technology, similar to that found in Yasuhiro Nightow's manga series, Trigun. The most prominent characters in the series are powder hunters, individuals who seek the titular zombie powder. The zombie powder is a life-giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force, grant them immortality, and even raise people from the dead. Zombie powder can only <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rings of the Dead. These rings are dangerous magical artifacts that, individually, devour the life force of anyone they touch, rendering them comatose. This stolen life energy is converted into the zombie powder, which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of the Dead are brought together.|$|E
5|$|Since {{free speech}} may be {{exercised}} during assemblies and gatherings, Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly, is relevant. Prior to October 2009, the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ("PEMA") required a licence to <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Public Entertainments Licensing Unit (PELU) of the Singapore Police Force before talks, discussions or similar events {{open to the}} public were held. Holding an event without a licence would result in a fine or imprisonment. Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences, and that they had been denied licences without reason. The Workers' Party was fined $800 after a dinner event in 1986, at which the Party's Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech. PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities, a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed. In addition, the Act exempted public entertainments provided by or {{under the auspices of the}} Government, thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors.|$|E

5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E
