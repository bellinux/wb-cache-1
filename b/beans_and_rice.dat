Severe localized flooding occurred in Nicaragua, Panama, and most significantly Costa Rica. There, {{several days of}} heavy rainfall damaged about 180 mi (300 km) of roads and bridges, mostly in rural areas. In Upala in the northern portion of the country, the rains damaged <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> crops. More than 700 homes were destroyed, leaving about 4,000 people homeless. Nationwide, the system killed six people and caused $30 million in damage. In Panama, the floods killed two people.|$|E

Barson was particularly displeased with the band's skinhead association, often finding it disappointing that so many were present at performances. Before becoming a full member of the band, Chas Smash {{had been involved in}} fights with skinheads at performances. In one incident on 18 November 1979, Madness were supported by Red <b>Beans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rice,</b> who featured a black lead singer, and the band was prevented from completing the performance due to the racist chants from certain members of the skinhead-filled audience.

5|$|A {{handful of}} pub rock acts managed to achieve {{mainstream}} success after {{the advent of}} punk rock, often being re-categorised as new wave music, including Graham Parker and the Rumour, Nick Lowe, Squeeze and Elvis Costello. London-based R pub rock bands received a major boost when The Jam kicked off the mod revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City, which mixed R standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. Pub rock bands like Red <b>Beans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rice,</b> The Little Roosters, The Inmates, Nine Below Zero and Eddie and the Hot Rods, became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London. Other bands grew up to feed the desire for mod music, often combining the music of 60s mod groups with elements of punk music, including The Lambrettas, The Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early 80s. Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed The Style Council, who abandoned most {{of the elements of}} punk to adopt music much more based in R and early soul. Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood, re-emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s, being as defined as blue-eyed soul singers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Rice bran {{contains}} both excellent {{nutritional value}} and functional advantages. Its utilization is limited due to reducing texture and low storage. To satisfy various tastes, Bacillus spp. having high amylase and protease activities were selected. Using the strains, we made whole grain soybean Meju with a reduced manufacturing period {{by increasing the}} concentration of total nitrogen. We made soy sauces with mashing ratios of soy <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> bran at 10 : 0, 9 : 1, 7 : 3, and 5 : 5, and then compared their physiochemical properties. After 2 weeks of fermentation, the sugar content increased from 21 ～ 22 % to 30 ～ 32 %. However, pH and salinity showed no differences. At a ratio of 9 : 1, total nitrogen, amino nitrogen content, and total free amino acid contents were the highest at 1. 62 %, 652. 52 mg%, and 8, 804. 03 mg/kg, respectively, compared to other mashing ratios of soy <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> bran. Especially, the contents of aspartic and glutamic acid, which increase delicate flavoring, were higher in our soy sauce compared to those of general traditional soy sauce and brewed soy sauce, which were 504. 25 and 1, 262. 25 mg/kg, respectively. Serine and alanine, which are related to sweet taste, were present at 49. 50 and 518. 75 mg/kg, respectively, which were the highest among all mixing ratios, {{at a ratio of}} 9 : 1.

In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1976. Bibliography: leaves [90]- 96. Microfiche. xii, 96 leaves illCrosses {{with three}} lines of mung <b>bean</b> (V. radiata) <b>and</b> two lines each of adzuki bean (V. angularis), black gram (V. mungo) <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean</b> (V. umbellata) {{were made in}} order to {{determine}} the barriers to hybridization between species, and to assess the possibility of overcoming these barriers. This would provide useful information for exploiting wide germp 1 asm resources in breeding these valuable pulse crops. Reciprocal differences were common in all the species combinations. These differences were observed in pod set, embryo abortion, embryo culture, and seedling lethality. No crosses were successful in both directions. The results of six interspecific combinations are summarized as follows: (1) Adzuki <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> black gram was the least successful combination. Although pod set was normal when adzuki bean was used as the female, embryo abortion was complete and no seedlings obtained from embryo culture survived beyond the seedling stage. (2) Black gram <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean</b> was also a very difficult combination to produce. Some seedlings obtained by embryo culture from crosses using black gram as the pistillate parent reached adult stage, but died before flowering. (3) Adzuki <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> mung <b>bean</b> was a somewhat more successful combination. Hybrids from mung bean produced by embryo culture flowered profusely but were completely sterile. Lack of chromosome pairing, shown by an average of 2. 39 II + 17. 22 I seems likely to be a principal cause of sterility. (4) The mung <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean</b> combination was somewhat easier to make than the last. Embryo abortion is not complete so that some crinck 1 ed but viable seeds are produced on mung bean used as the pistillate parent. However, the hybrids, with average chromosome pairing of 0. 09 IV + 4. 69 II + 12. 26 I, are still completely sterile. Colchicine- induced amphidiploids showed regular meiosis with 22 bivalents and greatly improved fertility, indicating that at least in this combination much of the sterility of the diploid hybrid is caused by chromosomal factors. However, low pod set and defective seeds in the amphidiploid indicate that some adverse genic interactions are still found. (5) The mung <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> black gram combination (the former used as the pistillate parent) produced hybrid seeds with good germination. However, the FI hybrids were only partially fertile. One quadrivalent in 37 % of the cells examined indicates that one reciprocal translocation has occurred during chromosome differentiation of these two species. Segregation for morphological characters and the appearance of highly fertile individuals in the F 2 and BC 1 demonstrate the possibility of gene exchange between these two species. (6) The adzuki <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean</b> combination obtained by culture of embryos from rice bean used as the pistillate parent was highly fertile with completely normal bivalent formation. Segregation for morphological characters and high fertility in the F 2 and BC 1 indicate the possibility of gene exchange between these species also. On the basis of crossability relationships, and on the assumption that cytoplasm which prevents the development of a hybrid embryo is the evolved cytoplasm, while cytoplasm which permits development of a hybrid embryo is the original type, evolutionary relationships of these four species are proposed. Mung <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean</b> are assumed to have been derived independently from a common ancestor, possibly radiata var. soblobata which is a wild species. Black gram <b>and</b> adzuki <b>bean</b> are considered to be later derivatives from mung <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean,</b> respectively. Thus, these four species can be divided into two subgroups, mung bean with black gram <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bean</b> with adzuki bean, in which the two species of each group retain enough chromosomal homology to allow germplasm exchange within the group...|$|R
