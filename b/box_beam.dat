5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E

The same equation from different codes for calculating RC specimens can accurately predict the ultimate strength of the control beam, but the calculation of the fib model overestimated the torsional strengthening improvement of the wrapped specimens.
