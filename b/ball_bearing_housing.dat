40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed to {{determine}} the wear properties of nanosilica filled epoxy polymers and FRP composites. Woven fiberglass has been deployed as the reinforcement material. The fibers were mixed with three different percentages of nanosilica-modified epoxy resin, i. e: 5 wt%; 13 wt%; 25 wt%, in order to fabricate the desired samples of FRP composites. The effect of nanosilica on wear properties was evaluated using dry sliding wear and slurry tests.

40|$|Abstract—An on-line {{active control}} {{technique}} for suppressing rotor vibration is proposed. Linear {{voice coil motors}} mounted on a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>housing</b> are used for generating counter forces to cancel the transverse vibrations of shaft due to imbalance, mis-alignment, and so forth. Controllers are designed by using the im-pulse response-based model predictive control (IMPC) and gen-eralized predictive control (GPC). Recursive-least-square (RLS) method is employed for real-time system identification. Multiple channel active control systems are implemented on the platform of a digital signal processor (DSP). Experimental evaluation indicated that the proposed methods were effective in suppressing the peri-odic disturbances due to constant as well as variable rotor speed. In particular, GPC has achieved the most satisfactory performance in terms of vibration attenuation and convergence speed.

40|$|Gas {{turbines}} are {{fitted with}} rolling element bearings, which transfer loads and supports the shafts. The {{interaction between the}} rotating and stationary parts in the bearing causes a conversion {{of some of the}} power into heat, influencing the thermal behaviour of the entire bearing chamber. To improve thermal modelling of bearing chambers, this work focused on modelling of the heat generated and dissipated around the bearings, in terms of magnitude and location, and the interaction with the components/systems in the bearing chamber. A thermal network model and a finite element model of an experimental high-pressure shaft <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> and <b>housing</b> were generated and a comparison to test rig results have been conducted. Nevertheless, the purpose of the thermal matching process that focused on the finite element model and experimental data is to provide a template for predicting temperatures and heat transfers for other bearing models. The result of the analysis shows that predictions of the thermal network are considerate, despite the simplifications. However, lower relative errors were obtained in the finite element model compared to the thermal network model. For both methods, the highest relative error is seen to occur during transient (acceleration and deceleration). This observation highlights the importance of boundary conditions and definitions: surrounding temperatures, heat split and the oil flow, influencing both the heat transfer and heat generation. These aspects, incorporated in the modelling and benchmarked with experimental data, can help facilitate other related cases where there is limited or no experimental data for validation...|$|R

Therefore they have received great attention {{in the field of}} condition monitoring. Different methods are detection and diagnosis of the bearing defects. Among them the commonly used technique is vibration signature analysis. The information obtained from the system vibration can be used for identifying its response subjected to various conditions. In rolling element bearing, contamination of lubricant grease by solid particles is one among the several reasons for early bearing failure.
