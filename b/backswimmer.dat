50|$|Notonecta glauca can {{discriminate}} between prey and non-prey, like other <b>backswimmers,</b> by surface waves. Lang (1979), completed an experiment {{that showed that}} waves that were created by other <b>backswimmers</b> swimming, emerging, turning and paddling were of a lower frequency (below 40 Hz) compared to waves created by their prey items, who had a frequency between 70-140 Hz. Larval <b>backswimmers</b> were found to create different waves that differed from adult <b>backswimmers,</b> but their frequency were {{similar to that of}} adult swimming produced waves (up to 70 Hz).|$|R
50|$|Pleidae {{belong to}} the Tripartita which {{contains}} the more advanced lineages of true water bugs, and {{are closely related to}} the true <b>backswimmers</b> (Notonectidae), but closer still to the Helotrephidae, another family of tiny Nepomorpha, which usually swim upside-down and, like the Pleidae, have a sensory organ {{in the center of the}} clypeus. Either the pygmy <b>backswimmers</b> are united with the Helotrephidae in the superfamily Pleoidea, or these two and the true <b>backswimmers</b> are placed in a single superfamily Notonectoidea.|$|R
50|$|Pygmy <b>backswimmers</b> inhabit {{lacustrine}} ecosystems, {{where they}} occur in loose groups. Like {{many of their}} relatives, they are predatory, hunting other tiny invertebrates, from which they suck out the body fluids with their rostrum. They can to some extent biologically control mosquito larvae. Unlike true <b>backswimmers</b> (Notonectidae), they are completely harmless to humans, as their rostrum is far too small to pierce skin.|$|R

50|$|Notonecta maculata is a <b>backswimmer</b> of {{the family}} Notonectidae, found in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|The tarsi {{consist of}} two or three segmnents; two claws are borne on the last tarsal segment of the hindlegs. Though the hindlegs are hairless and appear ill-suited for {{swimming}} compared to the stout [...] "flippers" [...] of the water boatmen (Corixidae) or the <b>backswimmers</b> (Notonectidae), the small size of the pygmy <b>backswimmers</b> makes for different physics and allows them to swim well regardless.|$|R
50|$|Stridulatory {{sounds are}} {{produced}} among the aquatic Corixidae and Notonectidae (<b>backswimmers)</b> using tibial combs rubbed across rostral ridges.|$|R
40|$|<b>Backswimmers</b> (Notonectidae) {{are common}} diving insects found {{around the world}} that exploit the mid-water zone for {{predation}} — they breathe by using an air bubble collected at the surface. Here we show that <b>backswimmers</b> achieve prolonged periods of neutral buoyancy by using oxygen stored in their haemoglobin to stabilize the volume of the bubble as they breathe from it. This enables them to maintain their position in the water column without continually swimming...|$|R

50|$|The first {{subsystem}} {{is sensitive}} to green light, one of the colours in the visible spectrum. This sensitivity helps the <b>backswimmer</b> see in dimmer light or at night. The second subsystem allows the <b>backswimmer</b> to see in bright light and when in flight. Notonecta glauca pupil (acone) take a different {{amount of time to}} adjust to light. It takes the N. glauca approximately 40 minutes for the pupil to adjust to daylight and approximately 50 minutes to adjust to the light at night.|$|E
50|$|Notonecta irrorata is {{a species}} of <b>backswimmer</b> native to North America first {{described}} by Philip Reese Uhler in 1879. Presence of N. irrorata in ponds is known to repel the oviposition of Culex mosquitoes.|$|E

50|$|Damselflies, both nymphs and adults, are {{eaten by}} {{a range of}} predators {{including}} birds, fish, frogs, dragonflies, other damselflies, water spiders, water beetles, <b>backswimmers</b> and giant water bugs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} genus of <b>Backswimmers</b> is Notonecta - streamlined, deep-bodied bugs up to 16 mm long, green, brown, or {{yellowish}} in colour. N. maculata, is distinguished by its mottled brick-coloured forewings.|$|R
5000|$|Predator prey {{interactions}} are another factor affecting <b>backswimmer</b> ecology. Notonecta are generalist predators that attack and consume {{many types of}} aquatic invertebrates and terrestrial prey that fall {{on the surface of}} the water. They are known to prey on small crustaceans, nymphs and adults of corixids, dragonfly nymphs, caddisflies and fish eggs. Specifically, N. undulata prefers to eat mosquito larvae over any other type of invertebrate. Studies have been conducted between the Grousewinged <b>backswimmer</b> and [...] Aedes aegypti, a type of mosquito that has been known to act as a vector for malaria and yellow fever. As a consequence, N. undulata has been suggested as a prudent biological control.|$|E
50|$|Notonectidae is a {{cosmopolitan}} family of aquatic insects {{in the order}} Hemiptera, commonly called Backswimmers because they swim upside down. The Common <b>Backswimmer,</b> Notonecta glauca, is widespread in the United Kingdom, where it {{is known as the}} greater water boatman, and in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Notonecta undulata, {{also known}} by the common name grousewinged <b>backswimmer,</b> are from the family Notonectidae and the insect {{suborder}} Heteroptera. They are a type of hemipteran or true bug. These aquatic insects typically spend their time at the water's surface, using their abdomen and legs to cling to {{the underside of the}} surface tension. The Grousewinged <b>backswimmer</b> can be found in both lotic and lentic environments; however, they typically prefer small ponds and lakes where the water is slow-moving with less current. They swim upside down looking for prey. Once they stop swimming they float back up to the surface. These insects can be distinguished from water boatman or Corixidae by their segmented beak and front legs. Water boatman have highly modified front legs whereas backswimmers do not. Backswimmers are distributed across a broad range throughout North America. However, the species Notonecta undulata has only been documented and studied in southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the western United States. N. undulata differs from other backswimmers by their antennae and size. They are approximately 10-12 mm long, and their antennae are 4 segmented ...|$|E
50|$|Their hindleg claws {{enable them}} to clamber through {{vegetation}} which apart from swimming is their main form of locomotion. Like Notonectidae, they are in an upside-down position when swimming. This is ultimately because as all true water bugs, Pleidae are air-breathers without gills. Similar to the true <b>backswimmers,</b> pygmy <b>backswimmers</b> carry an air reserve with them which is periodically replenished by a dash to the water's surface. This air is contained in a felt-like cushion on the underside. Thus, the belly has higher buoyancy, resulting in the animal turning upside down {{as soon as it}} lets loose from the substrate.|$|R
50|$|Tests on Daphia, <b>backswimmers,</b> midges {{and water}} boatmen found no {{significant}} effects on survival. Another test found that the mortality rate for Daphnia fed gypsy moth larvae in virus treated water was {{similar to those in}} virus free water, 2.2% versus 3.1%.|$|R
5000|$|Pleidae, the pygmy <b>backswimmers,</b> is {{a family}} of aquatic insects in the order Hemiptera (infraorder Nepomorpha, or [...] "true water bugs"). There are 37 species in three genera, {{distributed}} across most of the world, except the polar regions and remote oceanic islands.|$|R
50|$|N. undulata {{typically}} inhabit {{ponds and}} lakes {{but have been}} known to occupy small streams or rivers when resources become limited or competition in lentic environments is too high. Backswimmers will maximize conditions by flying and seeking out areas to settle. It has also been tested that the Grousewinged <b>backswimmer</b> will have a higher dispersal rate when predation levels increase in the environment. Ponds have a greater surface area to volume ratio of vegetation than lakes which increases the amount of hiding places and food for the insect. This makes ponds one of the best locations for the <b>backswimmer.</b> These insects may prefer ponds because the distribution of N. undualata depends on food supply. It has been found that ponds and wetlands have a higher diversity of organisms which is often related to nutrient and food resources. Temperature can also affect the distribution of Grousewinged backswimmers. Scientific study has shown that N. undulata is capable of surviving over a wide range of temperatures and conditions. They {{have been known to}} withstand temperatures ranging from 4 to 32 °C and water hardness between 28 and 220 ppm. In nature, they will avoid temperatures higher than 32 °C by flying and searching out new locations; however, they can withstand them for short periods of time through the use of their cuticular lipid monolayer. This physiological adaptation allows them to uptake water and avoid dehydration when temperatures get too high. The pH level of water can also affect the backswimmer's choice of habitat or niche. N. undulata has been documented to prefer pH levels between 6.0 and 7.1, a relatively normal water acidity. Environmental factors such as pH, temperature and trophic interactions affect the ecology of the Grousewinged <b>backswimmer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Notonecta glauca is {{a species}} of aquatic insect, and a type of <b>backswimmer.</b> It is the most {{widespread}} and abundant of the four British notonectids. They are also found throughout North America. Notonecta glauca are Hemiptera (true bug) predators, that are approximately 13-16 mm in length. They {{are the most common}} <b>backswimmer</b> species (49%). Females have a larger body size compared to males. These water insects swim and rest on their back (hence their common name [...] "Backswimmer" [...] or [...] "Water Boatman") and are found under the water surface. Notonecta glauca supports itself under the water surface by using their front legs and mid legs and the back end of its abdomen and rest them on the water surface; They are able to stay under the water surface by water tension, also known as the air-water interface (Surface tension). they use the hind legs as oars. Notonecta glauca will either wait for its prey to pass by or will swim and actively hunt its prey. When the weather is warm, usually in the late summer and autumn, they will fly between ponds. Notonecta glauca reproduce in the spring.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are called}} bloodworms because some larva are bright red, {{but they can}} also be found in brown and almost black. When the larva pupate, they drift towards the surface, making them {{vulnerable}} to many types of fish. Other common predators include the common <b>backswimmer</b> (Notonecta glauca), common pondskater (Gerris lacustris), common toad (Bufo bufo), lesser water boatman (Corixa punctata), dragonflies, damselflies, great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), great diving beetle (Dytiscus marginalis), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris), water scorpion (Nepa cinerea) and other midges such as Anatopynia plumipes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standing}} pond, supplied and {{flushed with}} rains, contains {{a variety of}} aquatic life include Gambusia fish and other species, whirligig beetles, <b>backswimmers,</b> dragonfly nymphs, and mayfly nymphs. [...] The tidal part of Eprapah Creek of course is home to fish, molluscs, and crabs.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{all other}} diving insects, <b>backswimmers</b> {{of the genus}} Anisops can exploit the pelagic zone by {{temporarily}} achieving near-neutral buoyancy {{during the course of}} a dive. They begin a dive positively buoyant due to the large volume of air carried in their ventral air-stores, but rapidly enter a protracted period of near-neutral buoyancy before becoming negatively buoyant. This dive profile is due to haemoglobin found in large tracheated cells in the abdomen. Fibre optic oxygen probes placed in the air-stores of submerged bugs revealed that oxygen partial pressure (PO 2) dropped in a sigmoid curve, where a linear decline preceded a plateau between 5. 1 and 2. 0 kPa, before a final drop. Buoyancy measurements made by attaching <b>backswimmers</b> to a sensitive electronic balance showed the same three phases. Inactivating the haemoglobin by fumigating <b>backswimmers</b> with 15 % CO eliminated both buoyancy and PO 2 plateaus. Oxygen unloaded from the haemoglobin stabilises the air-store during the neutrally buoyant phase after a decrease in volume of between 16 % and 19 %. Using measurements of air-store PO 2 and volume, it was calculated that during a dive the haemoglobin and air-store contribute 0. 25 and 0. 26 µl of oxygen, respectively. Philip G. D. Matthews and Roger S. Seymou...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike their {{relatives}} the <b>backswimmers,</b> who swim upside {{down near the}} surface of the water, Corixidae swim right side up near the bottom of ponds or streams. It is easy to tell the two types of insects apart simply by looking at where the insect is in the water and whether it is swimming upside down.|$|R
50|$|The grousewinged <b>backswimmer</b> is bivoltine. Females of {{the first}} {{generation}} become adults and reproductively mature in July producing a second generation. The adults that become mature after July enter reproductive diapause which ends by late October. All N. undulata will overwinter in the adult stage and begin depositing eggs in the early spring. Eggs develop through 5 nymphal instars during the spring and summer. The preoviposition period lasts 16 days and eggs tend to be laid in ponds or calmer lakes rather than fast-flowing streams. The eggs are attached to plants or other suspended objects within the water column. They are elongate ovals, usually 1.7 mm x 0.6 mm. The incubation period lasts 5-14 days and oviposition is continuous in summer.|$|E
5000|$|Backswimmers swim {{on their}} backs, vigorously {{paddling}} with their long, hair-fringed hind legs and attack prey {{as large as}} tadpoles and small fish. They can inflict a painful [...] "bite" [...] on a human being (actually, similar to a mosquito [...] "bite", it is a stab with their tubular mouthpart). They inhabit still freshwater, e.g. lakes, ponds, marshes, and are sometimes found in garden ponds. Although primarily aquatic, they can fly well and so can disperse easily to new habitats.They seem to be attracted to light; similar to a moth drawn to a flame. For instance, if a <b>Backswimmer</b> enters a swimming pool with an LED light seen under the water, it will inspect the light by swimming up close to it and never leaving that spot.|$|E
50|$|Notonecta undulata is the Linnaean {{name for}} the grousewinged <b>backswimmer.</b> This species is {{classified}} as a true bug under the suborder Heteroptera. They are located under the family Notonectidae, which {{is divided into two}} subfamilies: Notonectinae and Anisopinae. Individuals that are in the subfamily Notonectinae are distinguishable from their Anisopinae relatives by their 4-segmented beak and antennae. Insects from the subfamily Notonectinae are also larger, approximately 10-16 mm in length. N. undulata measure 10-12 mm. Grousewinged backswimmers can range from a dull greenish yellow to black. The head of back is convex and the antennae are short and concealed beneath the eye. The scutellum is usually black with pale spots on the sides and at the apex. The hind tibiae and tarsus have dense bristle like hairs that make them appear oar-like. This allows them to be efficient swimmers; however, it has been documented that members of the genus Notonecta are not as good at swimming as Buenoa sp. The front and middle tarsi have apical claws; however, the hind tarsi are clawless. There are 5 points on the <b>backswimmer</b> that allow it to attach to the surface film of the water. These 5 points include the anterior legs and the abdomen of the insect. There are receptors associated with each of these points that help the insect in locomotion and capturing prey. Grousewinged backswimmers also lack ocelli. The need to detect light was mostly likely lost through natural selection due to a variety of environmental pressures. Their beak is stout and the ventral surface of the abdomen has a prominent hairy keel. The front and middle legs are approximately one half shorter than the hind legs and the femur is enlarged basally. The wing membrane also has a large black spot on the median line and the hemelytra are pale.|$|E
50|$|One {{entomologist}} visiting Gillies Hill stated, “It {{would take}} five entomologists {{a lifetime to}} inventory all the insects on this hill.” Nevertheless, 88 invertebrate species have been documented on Gillies Hill so far; mollusks, arachnids, annelids and insects which include bumblebees, wasps, ants and sawflies, damselflies, dragonflies, caddisflies, grasshoppers, stoneflies, <b>backswimmers,</b> butterflies, moths, house flies, ants, knapweed bugs, water striders, aphids, and a myriad of beetles.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} predators of {{immature}} mosquitoes {{was conducted on}} the island of Kauai, Hawaii, in taro fields, major larval mosquito habitat of Culex quinquefasciatus Say. The survey consisted of examinations of samples from taro field water in two series: monthly at five locations and weekly at two of the same five locations. Copepods (Macrocyclops albidus Jurine), mosquito eating fish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard and Poecilia reticulata Peters) and aquatic insects, including <b>backswimmers</b> (Buenoa pallipes Fabricius) and larvae of Odonata spp., were the most-commonly observed predators. While copepods were observed at all locations, <b>backswimmers</b> and mosquito fish were variably present. Copepod populations from all locations fluctuated during the surveys. For the two sites sampled on a weekly basis, adult mosquito counts were higher at Lihue (65. 60 per gravid-trap-day) than at Hanapepe (39. 91) while larvae were more frequently present at Hanapepe (79 % of weeks) than Lihue (33 %). There was no clear relationship at these sites between the relative abundance of the most frequently collected mosquito-feeding insects, copepods, and numbers of adult mosquitoes trapped...|$|R
50|$|Several {{families}} of Heteroptera are water bugs, adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, {{such as the}} water boatmen (Corixidae), water scorpions (Nepidae), and <b>backswimmers</b> (Notonectidae). They are mostly predatory, and have legs adapted as paddles to help the animal move through the water. The pondskaters or water striders (Gerridae) are also associated with water, but use the surface tension of standing water to keep them above the surface; they include the sea skaters in the genus Halobates, the only truly marine group of insects.|$|R
