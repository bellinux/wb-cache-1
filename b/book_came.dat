5|$|The Haunted Mask {{was written}} by R. L. Stine and {{originally}} illustrated by Tim Jacobus. The author says {{the idea for the}} <b>book</b> <b>came</b> from his son Matthew Stine, who was wearing a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also says that he incorporated a duck costume his parents got him for trick-or-treating in the book. Tim Jacobus's niece was the model for the cover of the book.|$|E
5|$|As the {{paperback}} <b>book</b> <b>came</b> into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because the publishers {{were concerned about the}} books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|Inspiration for the <b>book</b> <b>came</b> from a Douglas-fir {{tree with}} a curve in its trunk. While {{sitting by the}} tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, {{he did not know}} how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life. It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E

The stamps received support from many in Mexico who contended the cartoon was culturally acceptable and not viewed as racially offensive.

25|$|To {{write the}} book, {{in his spare}} time, he {{collected}} {{a lot of information}} on Canton Hospital, scouring newspapers, books, journals published by the hospital, and annual reports written by the Canton Medical Missionary Society. He looked at every single report, which included all the names of those employed at the hospital, names of all the patients, what diseases they had, what surgeries took place, income and expense sheets, donations to the hospital, and more. In both China and the USA, he searched for and interviewed previous staff of the hospital and graduates of the University Medical School.

In approximately 2010 Gerrold was reputed to have a considerable amount of work completed on the remainder of the series, and the fifth book, A Method for Madness, was listed on Amazon with a publication date. The publication date has been updated several times since; the last was January 1, 2014. At that time the remaining books in the series were tentatively titled A Method For Madness, A Time For Treason, and A Case For Courage. In 2017, he announced that the fifth book, now tentatively titled A Nest for Nightmares, and the sixth book, A Method For Madness, are nearing completion, over two decades after the last <b>book</b> <b>came</b> out. Whether a seventh Chtorr book is still planned, or what its title will be if it is, are unknown.

500|$|Both Steinbeck and Ricketts had {{achieved}} {{some measure of}} security and recognition in their professions by 1939: Steinbeck had capitalized on his first successful novel, Tortilla Flat, {{with the publication of}} The Grapes of Wrath, and Ricketts had published Between Pacific Tides, which became the definitive handbook {{for the study of the}} intertidal fauna of the Pacific Coast of the coterminous United States. Steinbeck was exhausted and looking for a new start; Ricketts was looking for a new challenge.
