40|$|Organic {{carbon in}} <b>bays</b> <b>of</b> the White Sea was studied {{for the first}} time in 1987. <b>Bays</b> <b>of</b> various types in the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Onega Gulf were investigated. Concentration of C_org ranged from 3. 5 to 9 mg/l. The highest weighted-mean {{concentration}} of C_org occurred in shallow <b>bays</b> <b>of</b> the Onega Gulf (Suma Bay - 6. 17 mg/l, Kolezhma Bay - 5. 25 mg/ 1); slightly lower levels occurred in the Soroka Bay (4. 85 mg/l) and Kem' Bay (4. 78 mg/l). The lowest concentrations were in deep <b>bays</b> <b>of</b> the Kandalaksha Gulf (Chupa Bay - 4. 35 mg/l, Velikaya Salma Bay - 4. 10 mg/l). As a rule C_org concentration decreases with depth in deep-water bays (but increases slightly in the thermocline layer). The key factor governing organic matter concentration in the <b>bays</b> <b>of</b> the Onega Gulf with river runoff is allochthonous terrigenous organic matter, as indicated by negative correlation of C_org with salinity (R=- 0. 83 +/- 0. 07, p= 0. 96) and nonsignificant correlation with primary production...|$|R

5|$|In late September 1933, {{the ship}} left the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Kotor and sailed through the Turkish Straits to Constanța on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, where she {{embarked}} King Alexander and Queen Maria of Yugoslavia. She then visited Balcic in Romania and Varna in Bulgaria, before returning via Istanbul and the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, arriving {{back at the}} <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Kotor on 8 October. On 6 October 1934, King Alexander left the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Kotor on board Dubrovnik for a state visit to France, arriving in Marseille on 9 October. He was killed the same day by a Bulgarian assassin, and Dubrovnik conveyed his body back to Yugoslavia, escorted by French, Italian and British ships.|$|E

5|$|The {{southwest}} monsoon {{arrives in}} two branches: the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times {{stronger than the}} <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal branch. The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the Malabar Coast of Kerala. By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. The <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from Cape Comorin to Orissa, swerves to the northwest towards the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By {{the first week of}} July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, Northeast India receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, it has left the country.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal on June 6 and developed into a depression the next day as it drifted to the north, moving over south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course overland, reemerging into the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} {{commanded by}} Admiral Pierre Vanstabel was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort.

Together, these officers mustered six ships of the line and numerous smaller craft. The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 merchant ships carrying enough food to feed France for a year.|$|E
