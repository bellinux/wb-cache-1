His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will start construction in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its energy resources by 2025. The extraction of shale oil had been delayed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years due to: the advanced level of technology that is required for extraction; and the relatively higher cost.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully {{over a couple of}} weeks.

5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore.

While the other fan was caught <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Daytona 500 {{is known}} for the final lap battle between Pearson and Petty. In 2007, ESPN rated the race as the fourth most {{interesting}} Daytona 500. Petty was leading Pearson going into the last lap <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> car lengths. Pearson used the draft to attempt a slingshot pass against Petty {{at the end of}} the back stretch on the last lap, but his car pushed high into the final turn while going around another car. Petty edged under Pearson, and their cars crashed into each other on the frontstretch in the final turns. They both spun out into the infield grass approximately 100 feet (30 meters) short of the finish line. Benny Parsons who was driving the third place car, was over a lap behind the disabled cars. With Petty unable to restart his car, Pearson slowly drove his Wood Brothers Mercury over the grassy infield past the finish line for his only Daytona 500 victory. He won a series-best ten races in 1976, but finished ninth in season points after competing in only 22 of 30 events. He won his only IROC race at the first race of IROC III in 1975/1976 at Michigan International Speedway and finished fifth in points.|$|E

5|$|The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, {{the soundtrack}} album for the still-uncompleted film, was {{released}} by Virgin Records on 24 February 1979. It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the Sex Pistols: There are the new recordings with vocals by Jones, Vicious, Cook, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as Edward Tudor-Pole, briefly considered as a permanent replacement for Rotten. McLaren himself takes the mic {{for a couple of}} numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album is completed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols classics.

5|$|He {{returned}} to racing against horses {{of his own}} age, starting the 8/15 favourite of a field of ten runners for the six-furlong Middle Park Plate at Newmarket. As the field neared the finish, Orme was travelling the best, {{and as soon as}} Barrett let him go, he immediately took the lead. El Diablo tried to close, but could not get to Orme, with the latter winning easily <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lengths, Gantlet being a neck back from El Diablo in third. Orme then started in the Dewhurst Plate, but his presence deterred many owners from entering and he faced only two rivals. He started as the 6/100 favourite, with El Diablo at 20/1 and Hatfield at 50/1. Orme led from the start, and with two furlongs to run he began to stride away. El Diablo tried to close, but Orme won by three-quarters of a length from him and was never extended. Hatfield finished well behind Orme and El Diablo in third place. Orme's final race of the season came on 30 October in the Home-bred Foal Post Stakes over five furlongs and 140 yards at Newmarket. He started as the 3/100 favourite and faced three rivals. Orme lead throughout the race and won easily by two lengths from Esmond, with Lucellum a further three lengths back in third place.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain basic data on the lower {{ionosphere}} in the Antarctic region, the usual ionosonde was remodeled into a portable type of low-frequency pulse sounder equipped with all solid state circuits except the final stages, which was suitable to field experiment. Three experiments were carried out. The first experiment was carried out at point F 16 in the Antarctic Continent about 20 km apart from Syowa Station <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> doublet antennas on the snow surface and the total length of each antenna was 475 m.
