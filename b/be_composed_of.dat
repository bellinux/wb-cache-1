5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> {{one or more}} clauses, that may in turn <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but {{the object of the}} phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings.

Signs can <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases.

5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> carbon and oxygen, {{spectroscopy}} typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of}} the white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface.

A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
