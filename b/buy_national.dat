2500|$|To acquire {{domestic}} routes, Pan Am, {{under president}} Seawell, set its eyes on National Airlines. Pan Am {{wound up in}} a bidding war with Frank Lorenzo's Texas International that boosted National's stock price, but Pan Am was granted permission to <b>buy</b> <b>National</b> in 1980 in what was described as the [...] "Coup of the Decade." [...] The acquisition of National Airlines for $437million further burdened Pan Am's balance sheet, already under strain after financing the Boeing 747s ordered in the mid-1960s. This acquisition did little to improve Pan Am's competitive position in relation to nimbler, lower-cost competitors in a deregulated industry as National's North-South route structure provided insufficient feed at Pan Am's transatlantic and transpacific gateways in New York and Los Angeles. The airlines had incompatible fleets (apart from the Boeing 727) and corporate cultures (partly {{as a result of}} the former being perceived by some Pan Am employees as mainly a regional [...] "backwoods" [...] carrier with few trunk routes), and the integration was poorly handled by Pan Am management who presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing National's pay scales with Pan Am's. Although revenues increased by 62% from 1979 to 1980, fuel costs from the merger increased by 157% during a weak economic climate. Further [...] "miscellaneous expenses" [...] increased by 74%.|$|E
