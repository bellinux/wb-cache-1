25|$|Benzoic acid was {{discovered}} in the sixteenth century. The dry distillation of gum <b>benzoin</b> was first described by Nostradamus (1556), and then by Alexius Pedemontanus (1560) and Blaise de Vigenère (1596).|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{many young}} Armenian males (among them poet and {{political}} activist Nahapet Rusinian and architect Nigoğayos Balyan) moved to France for education. Papier d'Arménie ("Armenian Paper"), a popular deodorizing paper, {{was created in}} the late 1880s by Auguste Ponsot. He visited Turkish Armenia and found out that the Armenians use <b>benzoin</b> resin and plant sap to disinfect their homes and churches.|$|E
40|$|<b>Benzoins</b> are {{oxidized}} to benzils {{in excellent}} yields by 0. 4 equivalents of Bi(N 03) 3 - 5 H 20 and 4 mol % of CU(OAC) 2. Bi(N 03) 3 - 5 H 20 is a stable, inexpensive, commercially available solid. The relatively low cost and low toxicity of bismuth(I 1 I) nitrate makes this procedure a particularly attractive method for oxidation of <b>benzoins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Alumina or {{silica gel}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} for a solvent-free oxidation of <b>benzoins</b> to the corresponding benzils. These catalysts are easily recovered after completion of the reactions, which are carried out either by heating in a sand bath or using microwave irradiation. Comparison of the results obtained with both catalysts indicates that all the reactants examined were oxidized faster on alumina than on silica under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|An operationally simple one-pot, two-step {{procedure}} for the desymmetrization of benzils is herein described. This consists in the chemoselective cross-benzoin reaction of symmetrical benzils with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by the methyl sulfinyl (dimsyl) anion, followed by microwave-assisted oxidation 20 {{of the resulting}} benzoylated <b>benzoins</b> with nitrate, avoiding the costly isolation procedure. Both electron- withdrawing and electron-donating substituents may be accommodated on the aromatic rings of the final unsymmetrical benzil...|$|R
25|$|The first {{industrial}} process involved {{the reaction of}} benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum <b>benzoin.</b> Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced synthetically.|$|E
25|$|The {{coastal region}} instead {{relied heavily on}} trade. The main ports were Pegu, Martaban, Tavoy, and Mergui. Products and goods from the interior—rice, and other food stuffs, {{as well as a}} variety of luxury goods (rubies, sapphires, musk, lac, <b>benzoin,</b> gold)—were {{exported}} to Malacca, Sumatra, the Coromandel Coast (Portuguese Pulicat, Masulipatam), Bengal and Gujarat. In return, Pegu imported Chinese manufactures and spices from Malacca and Sumatra, and Indian textiles from the Indian states; and indeed highly sought after state-of-the-art firearms from the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|Resins: Valued since antiquity, resins {{have been}} widely used in incense and perfumery. Highly {{fragrant}} and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include labdanum, frankincense/olibanum, myrrh, balsam of Peru, <b>benzoin.</b> Pine and fir resins are a particularly valued source of terpenes used in the organic synthesis of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some of what is called amber and copal in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil conifers.|$|E
40|$|A simple, highly {{efficient}} and mild catalytic oxidation of <b>benzoins</b> to the corresponding benzils was developed using manganese(II) Schiff base complexes as novel and reusable catalyst {{in the presence}} of acetonitrile as solvent and H 2 O 2 as green oxidant. This simple method affords benzil derivatives at room temperature in short reaction times with high yield and purity. This convenient procedure will allow a further increase of the diversity within the benzil family...|$|R
50|$|Several {{variations}} of the Stetter reaction have been developed since its discovery in 1973. In 2001, Murry et al reported a Stetter reaction of aromatic aldehydes onto acylimine derivatives to give α-amido ketone products. The acylimine acceptors were generated in situ from α-tosylamide substrates, which underwent elimination {{in the presence of}} base. Good to excellent yields (75-90%) were observed. Mechanistic investigations showed that the corresponding <b>benzoins</b> were not adequate substrates, contrary to traditional Stetter reactions. From this, the authors conclude the Stetter reaction of acylimines is under kinetic control, rather than thermodynamic control.|$|R
40|$|The zoospores of Phytophthora sojae are chemotactically {{attracted}} to the isoflavones genistein and daidzein that are released by soybean roots. In this study we have examined the response of P. sojae zoospores {{to a wide range}} of compounds having some structural similarity to genistein and daidzein, including isoflavones, flavones, chalcones, stilbenes, <b>benzoins,</b> benzoates, benzophenones, acetophenones, and coumarins. Of 59 compounds examined, 43 elicited some response. A comparison of the chemotactic responses elicited by the various compounds revealed a primary role for the phenolic 4 (prm 1) - and 7 -hydroxyl groups on the isoflavone structure. A few compounds acted as repellents, notably methylated flavones with a hydrophobic B ring. The chemotactic response to many of the analogs was markedly different among different strains of P. sojae...|$|R
25|$|The {{scent of}} amber was {{originally}} derived from emulating {{the scent of}} ambergris and/or labdanum but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum. The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. <b>Benzoin</b> is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.|$|E
25|$|The {{declared}} {{value of the}} bulk of goods from the carrack brought back by Consent and Salomon was £31,000 and the cargo of Virgin {{and two of the}} fluitships were assessed at £15,000. Pereguine, Welcome their prize and the other fluitship carried at least as much totaling over £51,000. As well as Brazil wood the carracks cargo consisted of pepper, cloves, indigo, cinnamon, mace, <b>Benzoin</b> resin, frankincense, gum-lac, aloes, calicoes, silks and rutile quartz blonde stones. In all the total would have represented £6,100 for the Lord Admiral and £3,050 for the Queen. Also of importance were new Portuguese rutters captured at Recife; Lancaster would use them to great effect for the first ever English East India company expedition in 1601.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} {{are still being}} studied and are not determined with absolute certainty. Stacte is variously described as being the extract of the transparent portion of the myrrh resin which exudes spontaneously from the tree, or a balsam from a tree such as opobalsamum or a styrax. Onycha, which in Greek means “nail,” is variously described as being the operculum from a shell found in the Red Sea (which are said to resemble a fingernail), the exudation from the rock rose bush called labdanum (both petals and markings which are said to resemble a fingernail), Styrax <b>benzoin,</b> bdellium, or even cloves. Galbanum is {{generally considered to be}} Ferula galbaniflua. Also considered is a milder variety from the Levant or possibly even a close relative of Ferula galbaniflua called narthex (or giant fennel). Pure frankincense is the resin of a tree of the boswellia species.|$|E
40|$|Benzaldehyde lyase (BAL; E. C. 4. 1. 2. 38) from Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar I catalyzes the {{reversible}} {{formation of}} <b>benzoins</b> from aromatic aldehydes, and, moreover, the coupling of aromatic with aliphatic aldehydes yielding derivatives of (R) - 2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenyl- propan- 1 -one (R) -HPPs), which are important chiral building blocks. In this paper, {{we report on}} the development of a reactor system that allows the selective production of substituted (R) -HPP-derivatives. The reaction systems yielding (R) - 1 -(3 -chloro-phenyl) - 2 -hydroxy- propan- 1 -one, (R) - 2 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy- 1 -(4 -methoxy-phenyl) -propan- 1 -one, and (R) - 2 -hydroxy- 3, 3 -dimethoxy- 1 -phenyl-propan- 1 -one were investigated. A kinetic model optimized by batch experiments was developed, for the description of both batch and continuously operated reactors. This model was used to describe the HPP production in a continuously operated enzyme membrane reactor. The reactor type used combines the advantages of high conversion and excellent selectivity with high space-time yields and total turnover numbers of up to ttn= 43, 000. Products were obtained in high yield on a gram scale...|$|R
40|$|Balsams {{have been}} used since ancient times, due to their {{therapeutic}} and healing properties; in the perfume industry, they are used as fixatives, and in the cosmetics industry and in cookery, they are used as preservatives and aromatizers. They are generally defined as vegetable material with highly aromatic properties that supposedly {{have the ability to}} heal diseases, not only of the body, but also of the soul. When viewed according to this concept, many substances can be considered balsams. A more modern concept is based on its chemical composition and origin: a secretion or exudate of plants that contain cinnamic and benzoic acids, and their derivatives, in their composition. The most common naturally-occurring balsams (i. e. true balsams) are the <b>Benzoins,</b> Liquid Storaque and the Balsams of Tolu and Peru. Many other aromatic exudates, such as Copaiba Oil and Canada Balsam, are wrongly called balsam. These usually belong to other classes of natural products, such as essential oils, resins and oleoresins. Despite the understanding of some plants, many plants are still called balsams. This article presents a chemical and pharmacological review of the most common balsams...|$|R
40|$|Benzaldehyde lyase (BAL, EC: 4. 1. 2. 38) is {{a highly}} {{enantioselective}} enzyme, which catalyses the formation and cleavage of (R) -benzoin derivatives. The asymmetric synthesis of (R) - 3, 3 '-dimethoxybenzoin (2 a) and (R) - 3 -methoxy- 2 '-chlorobenzoin (2 b) was investigated by means of reaction engineering and a reactor concept for the preparative synthesis was developed. For the synthesis of (2 b), the optimal ratio of 3 -methoxybenzaldehyde (1 a) and 2 -chlorobenzaldehyde (1 b) {{was found to be}} equimolar. An aqueous-organic two-phase system was found to be the best reaction system. The aqueous phase consists of phosphate buffer; the organic phase is formed by the substrate. As the catalyst is hydrophilic, the reaction takes place in the aqueous phase. As a result of their low solubility in the aqueous media the formed <b>benzoins</b> precipitate. Centrifugation and filtration were used to separate the product from the reaction media. In order to eliminate the by-products (2 b) was recrystallised. The synthesis of (2 a) was carried out with a high volumetric productivity of 2304 gL(- 1) d(- 1). In a further experiment the enzyme consumption could be minimised (ttn = 250, 100). Twelve gram of (2 a) (yield 82 %, purity 97 %, ee 99 %) and 19. 5 g of (2 b) (yield 86 %, purity 97 %, ee 99 %) were isolated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The Stetter {{reaction}} produces classically {{difficult to}} access 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds and related derivatives. The traditional Stetter reaction is quite versatile, {{working on a}} wide variety of substrates. Aromatic aldehydes, heteroaromatic aldehydes, and <b>benzoins</b> can all be used as acyl anion precursors with thiazolium salt and cyanide catalysts. However, aliphatic aldehydes can only be utilized if a thiazolium salt is used as a catalyst, as they undergo aldol condensation side reaction when a cyanide catalyst is used. In addition, α,β-unsaturated esters, ketones, nitriles, nitros, and aldehydes are all appropriate Michael acceptors with either catalyst. However, the general scope of asymmetric Stetter reactions is more limited. Intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions enjoy a range of acceptable Michael acceptors and acyl anion precursors in essentially any combination. Intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions can utilize aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with a tethered α,β-unsaturated ester, ketone, thioester, malonate, nitrile or Weinreb amide. It has been shown that α,β-unsaturated nitros and aldehydes are not suitable Michael acceptors and have markedly decreased enantiomeric excess in such reactions. Another limitation encountered with intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions is that only substrates that result in the formation of a six-membered ring show synthetically useful enantiomeric excess; substrates which form five and seven-membered rings either do not react or show low stereoinduction. On the other hand, intermolecular asymmetric reactions are quite confined to specifically matched combinations of acyl anion precursor and Michael acceptor, such as an aliphatic aldehyde with a nitroalkene. In addition, these substrates tend to be rather activated, as the intermolecular asymmetric Stetter reaction is still in the early stages of development.|$|R

2500|$|The word [...] "benzene" [...] derives {{historically}} from [...] "gum benzoin" [...] (<b>benzoin</b> resin), an aromatic resin {{known to}} European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th {{century as a}} product of southeast Asia. An acidic material was derived from <b>benzoin</b> by sublimation, and named [...] "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen.H6, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). In 1833, Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid (from gum <b>benzoin)</b> and lime. He gave the compound the name benzin. In 1836, the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance [...] "phène"; this word has become the root of the English word [...] "phenol", which is hydroxylated benzene, and [...] "phenyl", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (free radical H•) from benzene.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{difficulty}} {{has arisen}} since {{the passing of}} the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only [...] "intended to afford {{to the members of the}} medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It is obvious that it cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can only be used as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum <b>benzoin,</b> tragacanth, gum arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs by C.G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.|$|E
