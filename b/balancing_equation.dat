30|$|For the {{strength}} development of hardened cement, {{the strength}} and porosity seem to be highly correlated because of the stress concentration, which {{occurs as a result}} of {{the strength and}} pores of the hydration product. However, it is not easy to determine the characteristics of the elastic modulus using only its relationship with the pores because the compressive strength and elastic modulus show the same characteristic in relation to the porosity. However, the relationship between the porosity and compressive strength is expressed as a spatial probability distribution, which is dependent on the existence probability of the weakest point in the particle connections of the hardened cement, whereas the correlation between the porosity and elastic modulus is a parameter that represents the spatial structure that shows how the stress is transferred in the state before reaching the point of destruction (Maruyama 2003). Based on these characteristics, when the paste matrix is thought of as a hardened part of the gel, non-hydrated cement, and non-hydrated expansive additive, and as a two-phase pore material, elastic modulus models for the hardened part with and without pores are needed, both of which use the concept of the contact area. On the other hand, for a hardened cement mixed with the expansive additive, two elastic moduli are needed, one for the cement part and the other for the expansive additive part. In consideration of the mix ratio of the expansive additive, each elastic modulus must have a <b>balancing</b> <b>equation.</b>|$|E

To achieve the objective, a cooling tower heat <b>balancing</b> <b>equation</b> have been used to instill the correlations between a cooling tower cooling load to the four predefined parameters. Based on the premise established, the parameters of a cooling tower’s air flow and cooling water flow in a modulated process are utilized in an experimental system for collecting relevant operating data. Lastly, the artificial neural network tool derived from the Matlab software is utilized to define the input parameters being – the cooling water temperature, ambient web-bulb temperature, cooling tower air flow, and cooling water flow, with an objective set to instilling a cooling tower model for defining a cooling tower cooling load. In addition, the tested figures are compared to the simulated figures for verifying the cooling tower model.

The conventional supply-sided management approach to water supply causes increased wastewater generation with accompanied increased pollution loads requiring higher levels of mitigation environmental pollution. Where disposal of wastewater treatment effluent takes place in rivers and natural water bodies, the lack of adequate natural compensating capacity of such water bodies typically result in severe ecological damage of the aquatic environment. With a shift of emphasis to a sustainable demand side management approach (as opposed to a supply side one), the avoidance of water wastage and high wastewater generation represents both resource conservation and environmental protection friendly approaches and contribute to overall sustainability. The integrated nature of water supply and wastewater management systems require an approach that considers these systems holistically. A new paradigm for water management is therefore needed to ensure that the issues of waste disposal and pollution are dealt with in a sustainable manner taking into account the emerging objectives of modern society for resource conservation and environmental protection. A balance therefore has to be found between the uses of additional fresh water resources as a means of satisfying en ever increasing water demand {{on the one hand and}} alternative unconventional resource exploration and employment, without the risk of depletion of natural available fresh water resource flow, irreversible harm to the environment and social and economic constraints.

40|$|This paper investigates {{methods for}} {{producing}} Australian intercensal population estimates. Abstract Since the 1981 Census, the ABS has been producing estimates of estimated resident population (ERP) on Census year, and updates these with vital {{statistics for the}} intercensal periods. Estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ERP on each Census year have also been produced since the 1991 Census. However, the lack of sufficiently reliable births, deaths and migration data for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and the intercensal volatility in the Census counts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, do not {{make it possible to}} use the so-called standard approach to make intercensal estimates. Instead, ABS has produced population projections which have been widely used as a proxy for population estimates for various purposes. For some important users, however, this proxy is not sufficient or appropriate and therefore there has been significant demand from both government agencies and the community for intercensal population estimates. This paper investigates methods for producing intercensal population estimates. Due to the complexity of this task, the paper focuses on methods for estimates at the Australian level only. After highlighting key issues in data quality, and making an assessment of a series of historical ABS projections, the paper examines three key factors driving the growth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population and which should form part of any estimation method: (1) fertility levels and trends; (2) mixed parentage and births to non-Indigenous mothers; and (3) the extent of changing identification for Indigenous status on Census form. The paper concludes that the identification change plays a very important role and finds promise in using births registered in the last intercensal period to project identification change in the next Census. Building from these analytical results, the paper proposes an enhanced demographic <b>balancing</b> <b>equation</b> method for estimating intercensal population, and an iterative approach for estimating the intercensal population. The limitations of the proposed method and future directions are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses two subfields of sociology, criminology and demography, {{to investigate}} the demography of incarceration. Currently, a gap exists between the tools of demography and the understanding of incarceration. This gap inhibits the possibility to fully understand the processes driving and sustaining the growing prison population in the United States. The United States supersedes every other nation in its rate of incarceration, and the life-state of incarceration disproportionately affects different groups. As more people enter and cycle through the American judicial system, {{it is imperative to}} examine if, and how, their interaction modifies their current and future life circumstances. The dissertation studies three essential issues in the demography of incarceration: (1) the quality of correctional data; (2) current measures of mean length of stay in prison; and (3) mortality of persons under correctional supervision. ^ The first analysis uses the <b>balancing</b> <b>equation</b> of population change {{to investigate the}} reliability of prison and parole data. This study confirms the reliability of prison data, and establishes a probable source of error in parole data. The second chapter critiques and enhances current measures used to study mean length of stay in prison. It presents two new measures, which perform well under a variety of conditions imposed and tested via simulated populations. These new measures provide ease of calculation and also adjust for the biases present in unstable populations. The last chapter examines sex and race differenentials in the prison and non-prison population. The sex differential in mortality persists in prison, however the relative gap decreases. When we restrict the population to men in prison, the large racial differential present in the U. S. population virtually disappears. This work provides evidence that in standardized environments, the differences in mortality by sex and race diminish substantially. ^ In sum, the dissertation takes crucial steps towards understanding the demography of incarceration in the United States and establishes a model for future study of incarcerated populations. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} use of finite water resources and measures to extend the service value of these resources in water scarce countries is a pre-requisite for achieving sustainable development. There is constant pressure to explore new resources to meet the ever increasing demand posed by growth in population and that of industry in urban cities. Introduction of unconventional resources such as wastewater and greywater reuse, allows access to a readily available valuable resource and intrinsic value recovery {{for the benefit of}} society. Not only does this assist with fresh water resource conservation and optimal use thereof and mitigation of negative impacts but also closing of urban nutrient loops and extraction of chemical energy for energy generation. This research explores wastewater intrinsic value recovery at wastewater treatment plant and wastewater management system levels as part of the <b>balancing</b> <b>equation</b> of natural-unconventional resource use and environmental, social and economic constraints. A methodology for assessment of wastewater intrinsic value recovery was developed that derive a monetary equivalent of value recovery of reuse employing an econometric production function approach. Apart from a economic level life cycle analysis, the methodology developed include a holistic multi-criteria analysis (MCA) covering sustainability criteria related to the economic, technical, social and environmental domains. The methodology can be adopted to analyse the economic effects of choices between the different pathways of wastewater intrinsic value recovery or a combination thereof and performance differences between surface and ground water reclamation strategies. The methodology allows strategic level comparative analyses of wastewater management system options within the centralised-decentralised wastewater continuum and appropriate technology option choices, being demonstrated for sewered technology in the second case study of the research. It is concluded that wastewater beneficiation or intrinsic value recovery consists of three different pathways of reclamation, reuse and recycle, each being location specific with different social, environmental and economic repercussions. While reuse positively impact virtual water components and water footprints, modification to allow multiple water use is needed to apply the concept in wastewater management. By quantifying the impact of reuse on water availability for urban water supply systems the link between reuse level and resource conservation benefits is established. The main recommendations made include the exploring of shadow prices and contaminant removed at treatment and management system levels over multiple time periods. In addition, sustainability of extended system scale and technology options over the centralised-decentralised wastewater continuum and returns to scale of urban sewered systems within a South African context require investigation. The adoption of the methodology is also proposed to analyse the economic impacts of wastewater beneficiation pathways or combinations thereof, additional benefits of multiple water use and ways of adjustment of the virtual water (VW) concept to be more amenable to wastewater management. Furthermore, impact of reuse on increased water availability for urban water supply systems by incorporating a network-specific and consumer-end related system losses differentiation as link to resource conservation benefits assessment is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|Urban forests have aesthetic, environmental, human health, and {{economic}} benefits that motivate tree planting programs. Realizing these benefits depends on tree survival. Cost-benefit analyses for urban forest ecosystem services {{are sensitive to}} mortality rate assumptions and associated population projections. However, long-term mortality data is needed to assess the accuracy of these assumptions. Analytical tools from demography, such as life tables, mortality curves, and survival analysis, can improve our understanding of urban tree mortality. Demographic approaches {{have been widely used}} in forest ecology to quantify population dynamics and project future changes in wildland systems. However, to apply demographic techniques to urban forests, longitudinal data is needed, with repeated mortality observations on individual trees. In this dissertation, I analyzed five years of longitudinal data from two Northern California studies: street trees in Oakland and yard trees in Sacramento. These field projects are complemented by a conceptual overview of demographic approaches to urban tree mortality (Chapter 1), and an investigation of practitioner-based tree monitoring programs. For the Oakland study (Chapter 2), I documented tree mortality and planting rates, net population growth, and assessed selected risk factors for survival. I monitored the entire street tree population in a small plot for five years after an initial inventory (2006). I adapted the classic demographic <b>balancing</b> <b>equation</b> to quantify annual inputs and outputs to the system, tracking pools of live and standing dead trees. There was a 17. 2 % net increase in live tree counts during the study period, with 3. 7 % overall annual mortality. However, population growth was constrained by high mortality of small/young trees. Size-based mortality rates followed a Type III curve, with highest mortality for small trees, and lower for mid-size and large trees. I used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between 2011 survival outcomes and inventory data from 2006. Significant associations were found for size class, foliage condition, planting location, and a multiplicative interaction term for size and foliage condition. For the Sacramento study (Chapter 3), I assessed tree losses during the establishment phase for a residential tree give-away program. A cohort of young trees distributed in 2007 was monitored for five years. I used Random Forests to identify the most important risk factors at different life history stages, and survival analysis to evaluate post-planting survivorship. Analysis included socioeconomic, biophysical, and maintenance characteristics. In addition to field observations of tree planting status, survival, and maintenance, I also collected property ownership information (renter vs. owner-occupancy, homeowner change, and foreclosure) through the Multiple Listing Service and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics from the U. S. Census. I found that 84. 9 % of trees were planted, with 70. 9 % survivorship at five years post-planting. Planting rates were higher in neighborhoods with higher educational attainment, and on owner-occupied properties with stable residential ownership. Five-year survival was also higher for properties with stable homeownership, as well as for tree species with low water use demand. When I incorporated maintenance characteristics from the first year of field observations, factors related to tree care were important to survival. Many residents did not adhere to recommended maintenance practices. These results illustrate the critical role of stewardship and consistent homeownership to young tree mortality on residential properties, and suggest that survival assumptions in urban forest cost-benefit models may be overly optimistic. To learn more about practitioner-driven monitoring efforts, I surveyed 32 local urban forestry organizations across the United States about the goals, challenges, methods, and uses of their monitoring programs (Chapter 4). Non-profit organizations, municipal agencies, state agencies, and utilities participated. Common goals for monitoring included evaluating the success of tree planting and management, taking a proactive approach towards tree care, and engaging communities. Challenges included limited staff and funding, difficulties with data management and technology, and field crew training. Programs used monitoring results to inform tree planting and maintenance practices, provide feedback to individuals responsible for tree care, and manage hazard trees. Participants emphasized the importance of planning ahead: carefully considering what data to collect, setting clear goals, developing an appropriate database, and planning for funding and staff time. Urban tree monitoring partnerships between researchers and local organizations should be developed, with standardized protocols and clear research questions. Such partnerships would provide urban forestry professionals with improved mortality information to evaluate the success of planting programs, while expanding the data sets available to researchers. The Oakland and Sacramento studies (Chapters 2 and 3) offer examples of demographic approaches to urban tree mortality that can be replicated and expanded as more longitudinal data becomes available from both researchers and practitioners...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} basic factors {{of development and}} modelling of future mobility in passenger transport. Mobility development models are constrained by two basic factors, which represent travel time budget and travel money budget. Model and scenario of total mobility development is function of fixed travel money budget and travel time budget. By creation of model and future mobility development scenario in particular transport modes, we work on determination of particular transport mode shares and on four constraining factors. These factors are fixed travel time budget, path dependence, urban land-use patterns and <b>balancing</b> <b>equation</b> of total traffic volume. By model construction we examine at first two budget constraints of passenger – travel time budget and travel money budget, that are core elements of model methods. In further sequence we estimate future demand for services, that are offered by state, it means total mobility. Then we estimate share of offered mobility for each main mode of motorized transport (in CR conditions we speak about bus, railway and individual car passenger transport). These estimations are conducted overall for whole country or region and there are made scenario sensitivities form changes {{of the most important}} or uncertain presumptions. Generally mobility development models are projected to make possible formularization e. g. aggregate (regional or national) and long-term scenario. In essence we work on transport planning tradition and model explains, how passengers can select particular transport modes by satisfying their demand for mobility (term “mobility” used in model represents traffic volume measured by personal kilometres). But this model requires aggregated data. The aim of this model is not calculation of detailed estimations of travel distances and vehicles speeds, but rather total mobility prediction and prediction of offered share of each transport mode (so called modal split) within state and in aggregated regions in distant future. Future mobility development is determined by specific values of each transport mode in certain region or state. Within global mobility air transport share will increase in future, but other transport modes shares will decrease. In case of regional prognosis it is estimated that traffic volume share operated by conventional railways and HST has identical development in all world regions. However this uniform trend is estimated in no scenarios of cars and buses, although transparent trends are evident for these transport modes in majority of regions. In compliance with mobility future development slower transport modes will be substituted by faster. On permanently higher mobility levels then car share decreases according to growth of faster transport modes need (especially air transport) for satisfaction of increasing demand for mobility within fixed travel time budget. Multiple growth in mobility per capita cause demands of extreme mobility which proves by more frequent commuting for longer distances from place of living. Because extreme mobility depends on approach to high-speed transport modes, sparse inhabited areas will remain in certain regions. It relates to areas where travelling to traffic junctions (airports and stations of high-speed trains) is time demanding in HST system. By means of traffic volume prediction (car, bus, railway and high-speed transport, especially air and railway), the number of travels is estimated in distant future, used transport modes, e. g. within EU, in particular state or regions. Answers of these questions are decisive for long-term transport infrastructure planning and for mobility impacts assessment e. g. on environment. These matters are also the centre of interest by future market extension estimating for transport services technical equipment. We make efforts to create simple, but radical model, which shows probable answers of these questions. Reply of these questions requires construction of large-scale long-term models of transport system. But this mobility need very sharply contrasts with capacities of existing modeling techniques. Regional and urban transport models, which are the most intensive developed tools of transport planning must be orientated to prediction of local transport demand, flows and costs. These instruments optimalize direct traffic flows by cost minimization or consumer (passenger) utility maximization. They calculate with transport system details like e. g. numbers of cars using roads during several times and average speeds of location of lately built-up transport infrastructure. Essential detailed effect is also the fact that these models are based on big mutually related variables as car ownership, loading and vehicles utilization, travel banded charges, transport modes relative prices, urban travel speeds and passengers income. Regarding insufficient knowledges of relations among these variables, these multi-variation methods quickly degrade in distant future plans. Original requirements of transport planning models make these methods more inadequate tools for long-term scenarios development.

2500|$|To derive a {{generalized}} entropy <b>balanced</b> <b>equation,</b> {{we start with}} the general <b>balance</b> <b>equation</b> for the change in any extensive quantity Θ in a thermodynamic system, a quantity that may be either conserved, such as energy, or non-conserved, such as entropy. The basic generic balance expression states that dΘ/dt, i.e. the rate of change of Θ in the system, equals the rate at which Θ enters the system at the boundaries, minus the rate at which Θ leaves the system across the system boundaries, plus the rate at which Θ is generated within the system. For an open thermodynamic system in which heat and work are transferred by paths separate from the paths for transfer of matter, using this generic <b>balance</b> <b>equation,</b> with respect to the rate of change with time t of the extensive quantity entropy S, the entropy <b>balance</b> <b>equation</b> is: ...|$|R
