5|$|Classical Muslim {{scholars}} who {{were aware of}} Jewish and Christian denials of <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sonship of Ezra, explained {{that it was only}} one Jew or a small group of Jews who worshipped Uzayr, or that the verse refers to the extreme admiration of Jews for their doctors of law.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or <b>belief,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> divine guide is a fundamental <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} <b>the</b> relationship between <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness, humanitarian values, {{and attitudes toward}} asylum seekers amongst a sample of first year university students in Western Australia (N = 148). <b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness were measured <b>in</b> terms of <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fairness of decision making and <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fairness of treatment. Findings supported <b>the</b> hypotheses, <b>in</b> that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness {{were significantly related to}} attitudes and humanitarian values. Regression analyses revealed that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fairness of treatment and humanitarian values made unique contributions in predicting attitudes. However <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fairness of decision making did not make a unique contribution to the prediction of attitudes. <b>The</b> roles of <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> fairness and humanitarian values in attitudes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{future are}} an {{internalization}} {{of hope and}} optimism about future outcomes. This paper reviews and compares several theories of hope and optimism and highlights <b>the</b> features constituting <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. This paper points out that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future include a series of goal-directed thoughts and motivation, such as setting up valued and attainable goals, planning pathways, and maintaining self-confidence and mastery, so as to keep adolescents engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pursuit of goals. This kind of personal mastery, together with sociocultural values, family, school, and peers are the antecedents leading to <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, which is related to adolescents' well-being and positive development. In order to cultivate adolescents' <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, enabling their ability to manipulate goal-directed thoughts and motivation and providing a supportive environment including their family, school, peers, and the society are recommended. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established {{the foundations of}} the English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E

5|$|<b>Belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of water bulls persisted in Scotland {{until at least}} {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, descriptions are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. It differs from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which is more likely to be a resident of marshland.|$|E
5|$|Church <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{resurrection of}} the body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine how far previous reigns had broken Roman Catholic devotion, with its <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those that drew public financial support—had been shaken.

Trust in clergy who had changed their minds and were now willing to leave their new wives—as they were required to do—was bound to have weakened.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{success in}} the United States came a little later, when Michigan State University Press started {{publishing}} his books. His {{first visit to the}} country was on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and he lectured at various universities including Michigan State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Around this time, John Updike noticed his work and compared Narayan to Charles Dickens. In a review of Narayan's works published in The New Yorker, Updike called him a writer of a vanishing breed—the writer as a citizen; one who identifies completely with his subjects and with a <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> significance of humanity.|$|E

5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime.

5|$|Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena {{state that}} even though Gandhi often and {{publicly}} expressed his <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.|$|E
