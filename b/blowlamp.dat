50|$|To improve performance, the undersides of the woks {{are often}} heated with a <b>blowlamp</b> before the race.|$|E
50|$|A {{blowtorch}} (USA usage), or <b>blowlamp</b> (British usage, or rare or archaic), is a fuel-burning tool {{used for}} applying flame and heat to various applications, usually metalworking.|$|E
50|$|The Flugan had a {{wingspan}} of 5 meters, and {{the surface}} area of the wings was 13 m². It was powered by a steam engine heated by four blowtorches (UK: <b>blowlamps)</b> and it produced 10 hp (7 kW) at 2000 rpm. The power-to-weight ratio was actually better than the Wright engine. The total weight of the plane was 80 kg. The weight of the engine was 18 kg.|$|R
50|$|Although this lantern took {{slightly}} longer to start, compared with some Petromax types made by Ehrich & Graetz which were equipped with rapid, <b>blowlamp</b> type preheaters, it burned {{for hours on}} end without needing attention, providing 300 cp (candle power) light output.|$|E
50|$|A Wells {{light was}} a large paraffin-fuelled (kerosene) <b>blowlamp</b> used for {{engineering}} work, particularly for illumination, in Victorian times. At a time before widespread electrical lighting, {{they were the most}} common form of high-powered portable illumination used for construction work, particularly railways, civil engineering, shipyards and ironworks.|$|E
50|$|A {{flame gun}} {{is a large}} type of <b>blowlamp</b> with {{built-in}} fuel tank, used for various purposes: weed control by controlled burn methods, melting snow and ice off walk and driveways in the winter, starting a fire, etc. It is commonly confused in word usage with a flamethrower.|$|E
5000|$|A skilled potter {{can quickly}} throw a vessel from up to 15 kg of clay. [...] Alternatively, by {{throwing}} and adding coils of clay then throwing again, pots {{up to four}} feet high may be made, {{the heat of a}} <b>blowlamp</b> being used to firm each thrown section before adding the next coil. In Chinese manufacture, very large pots are made by two throwers working simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|As well as illumination, the Wells {{light was}} also used where a large {{portable}} <b>blowlamp</b> was required for heating. They were sometimes used for heating iron rivets, inserted red hot, during the assembly of structural ironwork. Although such rivets were normally heated in small portable coke braziers (which also used a cheaper fuel), the Wells light was favoured for some final assembly work at height, as the smaller lights were considered lighter and easier to lift into place high atop a bridge.|$|E
50|$|Other {{treatments}} {{have been}} tried that attempt to exploit the dry rot’s sensitivity to heat. The use of a <b>blowlamp</b> to kill dry rot by applying heat {{to the surface of}} affected areas was popular at one time. Obviously, this led to the risk of fire. Experiments showed that a surface temperature of about 100 C would have to be maintained for up to five hours in order to produce a temperature that would be lethal to fungus within a 230 mm thick wall.|$|E
5000|$|The Wells {{light was}} a typical <b>blowlamp</b> in principle, {{consisting}} of a floor-standing fuel tank with the burner on a tall post above it. It was distinguished by its large size, the more common plumber's blow lamp being a hand-held tool of about a pint in capacity. Wells lights were made {{in a number of}} sizes, the smallest Nº1 being of 800 candlepower with a 15 inch flame. Weighing 75 lb when filled, it was advertised as [...] "can be carried by a boy". The largest Nº3 produced 2,000 candlepower, weighed 240 lbs, and was available with barrow wheels for portability.|$|E
5000|$|A regular {{feature in}} the second series, medieval seer Nostradamus (played by TV's Emma Kennedy with a false beard, a [...] "flighty" [...] horse called David Collins and, for no {{adequately}} explored reason, a Welsh accent) would give his predictions for the week ahead, which would often be either completely absurd or extremely vague. The start of the segment {{would look at the}} previous week's predictions: if they were not correct, Nostradamus would be punished by a nipple cripple, or something similarly pseudo-sexual, by Richard. During one episode Richard obsessed about cress for a whole show, as a spoof of product placement deals. When Nostradamus only got one out of three predictions correct, a barbecue of cress was burnt with a <b>blowlamp.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{pastor in}} the Southern United States named burned {{a copy of}} the RSV with a <b>blowlamp</b> in his pulpit, saying that it was like the devil because it was hard to burn and sent the ashes as a protest to Weigle. (However, F.F. Bruce {{dismissed}} it as a publicity stunt and wrote that it had the opposite effect of causing nearly every family in that congregation to acquire a copy.) [...] The RSV translators linked these events to the life of William Tyndale, an inspiration to them, explaining in their preface: [...] "He met bitter opposition. He was accused of willfully perverting the meaning of the Scriptures, and his New Testaments were ordered to be burned as 'untrue translations.'" [...] But where Tyndale was burned at the stake for his work, Bruce Metzger, referring to the pastor who burned the RSV and sent the ashes to Weigle, commented in his book The Bible In Translation: [...] "...today it is happily only {{a copy of the}} translation that meets such a fate." [...] instead of Bible translators.|$|E
