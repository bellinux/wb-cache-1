It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It has <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> since 1968.|$|E

25|$|Darvon, a {{dextropropoxyphene}} formulation made by Eli Lilly, {{which had}} <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for 25 years, {{came under heavy fire}} in 1978 by consumer groups that {{said it was}} associated with suicide. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently. But Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign among doctors, pharmacists and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol. After determining the risks outweigh the benefits, the USFDA requested physicians stop prescribing the drug. On November 19, 2010 the FDA announced that Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals agreed to withdraw Darvon and Darvocet in the United States, followed by manufacturers of dextropropoxyphene.|$|E
25|$|Emerald is a {{rare and}} {{valuable}} gemstone and, as such, it has provided the incentive for developing synthetic emeralds. Both hydrothermal and flux-growth synthetics have been produced. The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham. The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., which has <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> since 1964. Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides. Growth occurs {{at the rate of}} 1mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7mm of thickness. The green color of emeralds is widely attributed to presence of Cr3+ ions. Intensely green beryls from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in which the color is attributed to vanadium have also been sold and certified as emeralds.|$|E

Obama acknowledged bringing his interest in the property to Rezko's attention, but denied any coordination of offers. According to Obama, while the properties had originally been a single property, the previous owners decided to sell the land as two separate lots, but made it a condition of the sales that they be closed on the same date. Obama also stated that the properties had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for months, that his offer was the better of two bids, and that Ms. Rezko's bid was matched by another offer, also of $625,000, so that she could not have purchased the property for less.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Gremlin line by VAM in 1974, which became the company's smallest and most affordable model, created {{a gap between the}} lower end Rambler American line and the larger, top Classic (Matador) line; the situation was also applicable to the performance Javelin line despite being discontinued in 1973. The difference in size and engine series between the Rambler American and the Gremlin was not enough for VAM to create the impression of a more solid and more importantly a diverse product line since both cars were perceived as belonging to the same economy level, which would also mean the creation of internal competition. The VAM Rambler American was restricted to the economy segment since its introduction to the Mexican market, the only exceptions to this being the luxury limited edition Rambler American Hartop (Rambler American 440H in US) for 1963 and 1965, as well as the sporty Rambler American Rally (Rambler American Rogue and Hornet Rallye X/Hornet X in US) from 1969 through 1974. The model was shifted from the economy to the mid-segment, as an all-new generation introduced for 1975. This didn't just readjust the company's full product line, but was also an opportunity to rejuvenate the compact line itself. By this time, the Hornet-based Rambler American had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for five years and saw continued sales and positive image. The name was simplified from Rambler American to just American, marking the discontinuation of the Rambler brand in Mexico. The greatest change was the creation of the new luxury American ECD trim level followed by a revised and improved American Rally and American base models, which helped to distance the line further from the Gremlin. The cars in all versions obtained substantial updates and upgrades.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2003, {{several months}} after its {{introduction}} in Europe, Richard Horton, {{the editor of the}} medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. [...] "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," [...] according to his editorial.

2500|$|Nobel prize-winning {{economist}} Gary S.

In 2011, the experience with Makena showed that a previously inexpensive drug could increase in price dramatically, from about $10 to $1,500 after the FDA regulated its marketing, approved it as orphan drug, [...] and granted it a temporary monopoly status, although it had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for five decades.

[...] The extended frame also provided enough length to allow scope bases to be mounted on the frame, rather than on the barrel as was done on the scoped versions of the Redhawk. [...] It was determined that the barrel separations on the Redhawks were due to a change in the lubricant used when attaching the barrels to the frames, but by that time the new Super Redhawk design was already well underway and the extended frame was kept.|$|E
