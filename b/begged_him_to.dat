5|$|In Baghdad, {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> use it as a pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
5|$|Lucidi {{offered to}} let Edgardo's father {{accompany}} {{them to the}} inquisitor {{to discuss the matter}} with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that this was confidential. When the men <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.|$|E

25|$|In Tyre, Balian of Ibelin {{had asked}} Saladin for safe passage to Jerusalem {{in order to}} {{retrieve}} his wife Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem and their family. Saladin granted his request, provided that Balian not take up arms against him and not remain in Jerusalem {{for more than one}} day; however, upon arrival in the holy city, Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem, Queen Sibylla, {{and the rest of the}} inhabitants <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take charge of the defense of the city. Heraclius, who argued that he must stay for the sake of Christianity, offered to absolve him of the oath, and Balian agreed.|$|E
25|$|Then, on 14 January 1891, in New Orleans, he won {{his first}} world title from Jack (Nonpareil) Dempsey. Fitzsimmons knocked out Dempsey (from whom the later Jack Dempsey took his name) in the 13th round to become the World Middleweight Champion. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey down at least 13 times and by the finish left him in such a pitiable {{condition}} that he <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> quit. Since Dempsey would not do so, Fitzsimmons knocked him out and then carried him to his corner. On 22 July, police broke off his fight with Jim Hall after he had knocked Hall down several times.|$|E

25|$|As the Paroubeks {{were not}} Catholics but freethinkers, {{there were no}} prayers, and the service was read by Rudolf Jaromír Pšenka, editor of the Bohemian Chicago Daily Svornost. He spoke {{of the need to}} {{cooperate}} with police to find Elsie's killers. As the undertaker went to lift the coffin into the hearse, Karolina <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> open it so she could see Elsie's face once more, but her relatives persuaded her not to insist on this and led her away. Most of the attendees followed Elsie's casket to Bohemian National Cemetery, where Pšenka gave another address.|$|E
25|$|The actress {{was known}} for her {{kindness}} to animals. She {{could not bear to}} see them abused or badly treated. Wheatley came upon a mule being beaten on Forsyth Street while {{she was a member of}} the Fawcett Stock Company in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1907. The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> restrain his temper. When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} {{describes}} other farm work duties and events, {{such as the}} birth of a calf, and the availability of milk, butter and cheese, gardening, field work, hunting, gathering, and more. Everyday housework is also described in detail. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When Pa returned in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary always <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play his fiddle, as he was too tired from farm work to play during the summertime.|$|E

25|$|This event {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} Rosh Hashanah. On that holiday, {{as he lay}} dying, Rabbi Amnon asked to be carried into the synagogue, where he recited the original composition of Unetanneh Tokef with his last breath (the story contains an ambiguous phrase that some commentators interpreted as saying {{that he did not}} merely die but that his body miraculously vanished). Three days later, he appeared in a dream to Rabbi Kalonymus ben Meshullam (died 1096), one of the great scholars and liturgists of Mainz, and <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> transcribe the prayer and to see that it was included in the text of the High Holiday services. Thus, the legend concludes, Unetanneh Tokef became a part of the standard liturgy.|$|E
25|$|The Fishes {{are also}} {{associated}} with the German legend of Antenteh, who owned just a tub and a crude cabin when he met a magical fish. They offered him a wish, which he refused. However, his wife <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to the fish {{and ask for a}} beautiful furnished home. This wish was granted, but her desires were not satisfied. She then asked to be a queen and have a palace, but when she asked to become a goddess, the fish became angry and took the palace and home, leaving the couple with the tub and cabin once again. The tub in the story is sometimes recognized as the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, in {{his famous}} paper on the change of {{wavelength}} of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible ultra-violet radiation into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes' honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, {{is the basis of}} Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> publish it.|$|E

25|$|In {{his last}} fight, Ross defended his title on May 31, 1938 against fellow three-division world {{champion}} Henry Armstrong, who beat {{him by a}} decision in 15. Although Armstrong pounded Ross inexorably and his trainers <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> let them stop the fight, Ross refused to stop or go down. Barney Ross had never been knocked out in his career and was determined to leave the ring on his feet. Some boxing experts view Ross's performance against Armstrong {{as one of the}} most courageous in history. Some believe that Ross's will to survive every tough fight on his feet had to do with his understanding of his symbolic importance to Jews. That is, Jews would not only fight back, but they would not go down.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 7th century, the Avars {{and later the}} Bulgars {{overwhelmed}} much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople with attack from the west. Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia. Heraclius, son of the exarch of Africa, set sail {{for the city and}} assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city could no longer be supplied from Egypt {{as a result of the}} Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result.|$|E
25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, <b>begged</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E
