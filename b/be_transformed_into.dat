5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into.</b> When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać.

5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E

5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

500|$|Thus, if P lies {{outside the}} circle, then P' lies within, and vice versa. When P {{is the same}} as O, the {{inversion}} is said to send P to infinity. (In complex analysis, [...] "infinity" [...] is defined in terms of the Riemann sphere.) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles <b>are</b> always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> lines and circles, and points <b>are</b> always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> points. Circles <b>are</b> generally <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> other circles under inversion; however, if a circle passes {{through the center of the}} inversion circle, it <b>is</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it <b>is</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E

5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, it could <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, {{especially if it}} turned out that uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This was very interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E
