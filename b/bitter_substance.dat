25|$|Quinine, {{a bitter}} {{medicinal}} found in tonic water, {{can be used}} to subjectively rate the bitterness of a substance. Units of dilute quinine hydrochloride (1 g in 2000 mL of water) {{can be used to}} measure the threshold bitterness concentration, the level at which the presence of a dilute <b>bitter</b> <b>substance</b> can be detected by a human taster, of other compounds.

25|$|The {{threshold}} for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages {{a concentration of}} 8 μM (8 micromolar). The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1. For example, Brucine has an index of 11, is thus perceived as intensely more bitter than quinine, and is detected {{at a much lower}} solution threshold. The most <b>bitter</b> <b>substance</b> known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000. It is used as an aversive agent (a bitterant) that is added to toxic substances to prevent accidental ingestion. This was discovered in 1958 during research on lignocaine, a local anesthetic, by MacFarlan Smith of Gorgie, Edinburgh, Scotland.|$|E

40|$|Discrimination of edible and noxious food {{is crucial}} for {{survival}} in all organisms. We have studied the physiology of the gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in contact chemosensilla (insect gustatory organs) located on the antennae of the moth Heliothis vir-escens, emphasizing putative phagostimulants and deterrents. Sucrose and the 2 <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> quinine and sinigrin elicited responses in {{a larger proportion of}} GRNs than inositol, KCl, NaCl, and ethanol, and the firing thresholds were lowest for sucrose and quinine. Variations in GRN composition in individual sensilla occurred without any specific patterns to indicate specific sen-sillum types. Separate neurons showed excitatory responses to sucrose and the 2 <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> quinine and sinigrin, implying that the moth might be able to discriminate <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> in addition to separating phagostimulants and deterrents. Besides being detected by separate receptors on the moth antennae, the bitter tastants were shown to have an inhibitory effect on phagostimulatory GRNs.

40|$|Das Wirtswahlverhalten von Blattläusen wird neben primären Nahrungskomponenten auch durch sekundäre Pflanzeninhaltsstoffe gesteuert (Klingauf & al. 1978; Singh 1980; Powell & al. 1999; Campo & al. 2003). Häufig entziehen sich diese jedoch einer gezielten Untersuchung ihrer Wirkung auf die Aphiden, da sie als Substanzgemisch vorliegen. Beziehungen zwischen Substanzkonzentration und Verhaltensmustern aus Electrical Penetration Graphs (EPG) sind nur mit mäßigem Erfolg über statistische Verfahren darzustellen. Eine Versuchsanordnung zur gezielten Prüfung verhaltensbeeinflussender Substanzen mittels EPG wäre in diesem Falle hilfreich. Ein geeignetes einfaches Testsystem müsste {{mindestens}} folgende Komponenten beinhalten: – eine von den Aphiden akzeptierte Oberfläche, welche die Kutikula / Epidermis eines natürlichen Systems nachbildet – diese Oberfläche sollte evtl. durch den Versuchsansteller manipulierbar sein – eine dem Parenchym entsprechende Schicht, in welche die Testsubstanzen einzubringen wären – eine flüssige Phase, die dem Phloem entspricht und ebenfalls in ihrer Zusammensetzung variiert werden kann. In {{this work}} the behaviour of Phorodon humuli (Schrank) during feeding on artificial, semi-solid diets was examined by Electrical Penetration Graph {{in order to}} test the biological effects of secondary plant substances. Components of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) assumed to affect host selection (a mixture of the <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> humulone and lupulone) were added to the diet in different concentrations (0; 100; 300; 625; 1250; 2500; 5000; 7500 &# 956;l/ml deion. H 2 O). For comparison additional recordings were taken with the aphids being offered the non-hop component resveratrol, in concentrations of 0; 0, 4; 0, 75; 1, 5; 3; 6; 12 &# 956;l/ml deionized water. The results clearly show an influence of the <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> on the hop aphid’s feeding behaviour. Depending on concentrations, the animals reacted to <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> with differences in probing frequency and -time, sucking activity and other parameters. The probing activity was positively correlated with the resveratrol, a substance foreign to hop, whereas the sucking activity was notedly negatively correlated. So the resveratrol distinctively plays the role of an allomone, the <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> from hop, however, more that of kairomones.

40|$|In nature, moths {{encounter}} nutritious {{and toxic}} substances in plants, {{and thus have}} to discriminate between a diversity of tastants. Whereas olfactory learning allowing memory of nutritious plants is well demonstrated, {{little is known about}} learning and memory of toxic items in adult lepidopterans. Moths may use <b>bitter</b> <b>substances</b> to detect and possibly learn to avoid noxious plants. We have studied the physiological and behavioural effects of two <b>bitter</b> <b>substances,</b> quinine and sinigrin, on the moth Heliothis virescens. Electrophysiological recordings showed responses to both compounds in gustatory receptor neurons on the antennae. The response patterns suggested a peripheral discrimination between quinine and sinigrin. We evaluated their putative aversive effect in an appetitive conditioning context where the moths learned to associate an odour with sucrose. We first aimed at enhancing olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response by testing the effect of the sucrose concentration on acquisition, retention and extinction. 2 mol l(- 1) and 3 mol l(- 1) sucrose concentration gave similar acquisition, retention and extinction performances. Experiments involving pre-exposure or facilitated extinction with an odour paired with quinine, sinigrin or no tastant showed a latent inhibitory effect, as well as an aversive effect of quinine and, to a lesser extent, of sinigrin. The results suggested that the two tastants may act as negative reinforcers in H. virescens...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify by what {{mechanism}} the {{lipid bilayer membrane}} changes its potential under the stimulation of <b>bitter</b> <b>substances,</b> a microscopic model {{for the effects of}} the substances on the membrane is presented and studied theoretically. It is assumed that the substances are adsorbed on the membrane and change the partition coefficients of ions between the membrane and the stimulation solution, the dipole orientation in the polar head, and the diffusion constants of ions in the membrane. It is shown, based on the comparison of the calculated results with the experimental ones, that the response arises mainly from a change in the partition coefficients. Protons play an essential role in the membrane potential variation due to the change in their partition coefficients. The present model reproduces the following observed unique properties in the response of lipid bilayers to <b>bitter</b> <b>substances,</b> which cannot be accounted for by the usual channel model for the membrane potential: 1) the response of the membrane potential appears even under the condition that there is no ion gradient across the membrane, 2) the response remains even when the salt in the stimulating solution is replaced with the salt made of an impermeable cation, and 3) the direction of the polarization of the potential is not reversed, even when the ion gradient across the bilayer is reversed...|$|R
