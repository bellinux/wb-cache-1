40|$|The HOBr {{molecule}} is {{a potential}} reservoir of Br compounds in the atmosphere. In this work, the UV-visible spectrum of HOBr was measured over the range 242 – 400 nm. Its absorption consists of two maxima at 280 nm (&# 963;max= 2. 7 ± 0. 4 × 10 – 19 cm 2 molecules– 1 ) and 355 nm (&# 963;max= 7. 0 ± 1. 1 × 10 – 20 cm 2 molecules– 1 ), respectively, where the error is ± 1 &#x 03 A 3;. Atmospheric photolysis lifetime calculations for HOBr in the lower stratosphere have been made using the PHOTOGT model. The results show a strong dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA) implying a longer lifetime at high latitudes and a relatively short lifetime at low latitudes for example 714 <b>s</b> (<b>albedo</b> of 25 %, SZA of 20 ° and an altitude of 17 km), and 3226 <b>s</b> (<b>albedo</b> of 25 %, SZA of 88 ° and an altitude of 17 km). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of Br 2 O, which is an intermediate in the preparation, {{used in this study}} and is together with H 2 O in equilibrium with HOBr, was measured from 205 to 450 nm. The spectrum shows a maximum at 315 nm (&# 963;max= 2. 3 ± 0. 3 × 10 – 18 cm 2 molecules– 1 ) with a shoulder at 355 nm. From the results of the atmospheric lifetime calculations for Br 2 O, it is clear that this molecule has a short stratospheric lifetime and is not likely to have a large daytime concentration, for example, 20 <b>s</b> (<b>albedo</b> of 25 %, SZA of 20 ° and an altitude of 17 km), and 83 <b>s</b> (<b>albedo</b> and 25 %, SZA of 88 ° and an altitude of 17 km) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} combat the principle-agent problem, {{directors}} of public companies use incentive-based contracts to align the interests of CEOs and shareholders. Some studies suggest that these contracts are an inefficient use of resources, {{and that they do}} not motivate CEOs to do {{what is best for the}} firm. In this study, the author estimates a regression to find the relationship between CEO Compensation and market value of a firm. In order to address persistence, endogeneity and firm-specific effects the author uses the first-differenced and system GMM regression techniques first used by [Arellano, M.; Bover, O. “Another Look at the Instrumental-Variable Estimation of Error-Component Models,” Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1995, pp. 29 – 51] and [Blundell, R.

The contribution of the S organic fractions in meeting plant requirements in S is not well known. This study aimed to evaluate the variation of the mineral and organic S fractions in an Entisol where Marandu palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) was fertilized with N and S. A fractionated 52 factorial experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, in a randomized block design, with four replications. Combinations of five N rates with five S rates, supplied as NH 4 NO 3 and CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, were studied. Plants were harvested three times and the soil was sampled at each harvest. The total S content in the plant material was determined. Four soil S fractions were determined: inorganic SO 4 <b>S,</b> ester <b>bonded</b> <b>S,</b> carbon-bonded S, and residual S. The 400 - 40 mg dm- 3 N-S combination resulted in more S removed from the soil by the grass than the treatments with N or S supply alone. Inorganic SO 4 S in the soil was increased by S application. The carbon-bonded S did not change in the soil, in any sampling time, with any N-S combination. The ester <b>bonded</b> <b>S</b> was increased, and apparently did not follow any N and S fertilizations. Except for the combination 400 N- 0 S, the residual S fraction decreased as the time progressed. The variations of the S organic fractions in soil indicate that part of the S requirement of Marandu palisadegrass may be supplied by the residual S fraction...|$|R

The disulphide bonds that dissociated in 0. 2 M-NaOH were usually those that are solvent accessible and that can be reduced by mild chemical reductants. Some unexpected differences were found between similar proteins, both in the number of <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bonds</b> dissociated and in their rates of decomposition.

This intermediate is in mobile equilibrium with bisulphide ion, HS-, and decomposes at a mercury electrode or in acid solution to yield a stoichiometric amount of sulphide. Rate constants and equilibrium constants were measured for the equilibria between HS- and the intermediates involved in the alkaline dissociation of several proteins. Elemental sulphur was not detected in any of the protein digests. It is suggested that formation of HS- from a persulphide intermediate involves a hydrolysis reaction to yield a sulphenic acid derivative. The small polypeptides glutathione and oxytocin gave only a low yield of persulphide, and their alkaline decomposition must proceed by a mechanism {{different from that of the}} proteins...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the effects of cutting dentin with different burs at various speeds on the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of two self-etching adhesive systems. Materials and Methods: Flat deep dentin surfaces from 50 extracted human third molars were divided into 5 groups (n = 10) according to bur type and speed of rotation: (I) high-speed diamond bur, (II) low-speed diamond bur, (III) high-speed tungsten carbide bur, (IV) low-speed tungsten carbide bur. Controls were abraded with 600 -grit SiC paper. A two-step self-etching adhesive, Clearfil SE Bond (SE, Kuraray) and a one-step self-etching adhesive, Clearfil <b>S</b> 3 <b>Bond</b> (<b>S</b> 3, Kuraray) were applied to dentin surfaces and light cured. Composite buildups were performed using Filtek Z 250 (3 M ESPE). For μTBS evaluation, composite-dentin beams of 0. 8 mm 2 were stressed to failure at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The μTBS data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Representative fractured beams from each group were prepared for fractographic analysis under SEM. Results: Two-way ANOVA showed that the effects of dentin surface preparations, adhesive systems, and their interaction were statistically significant (p < 0. 001). The μTBS was the highest when bonding SE to dentin surface prepared with 600 -grit SiC abrasive paper (47. 3 ± 7. 4 MPa), followed by high-speed tungsten carbide burs (40. 8 ± 6. 1 MPa), and the lowest when <b>bonding</b> <b>S</b> 3 to dentin surfaces prepared with a high-speed diamond bur (15. 2 ± 6. 2 MPa). SEM observation of the fractured surfaces revealed mixed and adhesive failures for SE groups, while in the S 3 groups, adhesive failures predominated with numerous inclusion droplets. Conclusion: Higher bond strengths are achieved with SE bond when applied on dentin surfaces prepared with tungsten carbide burs. Proper bur and adhesive selection are essential to optimize dentin adhesion of self-etching adhesives. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid coordinations of As atoms <b>bonding</b> to three <b>S</b> atoms. In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> to two <b>S</b> atoms and one As atom, and <b>bonding</b> to one <b>S</b> atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: bonding to three As atoms, and bonding to one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type bonding to two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of three types: <b>bonding</b> to two <b>S</b> atoms and one As atoms, <b>bonding</b> to one <b>S</b> atom and two As atoms, and bonding to three As atoms. The As 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> to one <b>S</b> atom and two As atoms, and bonding to three As atoms.
