5|$|Insane Clown President: Dispatches {{from the}} 2016 Circus is a non-fiction book by Matt Taibbi about Donald Trump and the 2016 United States presidential election. The book {{contains}} illustrations <b>by</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone artist Victor Juhasz. Taibbi's choice of {{title for the}} book was motivated by Trump's marketing style. His work was inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, who had previously published Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1986, Burton {{died in a}} bus {{accident}} in Kronoberg County, a rural area of southern Sweden, as the band was touring {{in support of the}} Master of Puppets album. Burton was replaced by bassist Jason Newsted the following month. He was also posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Metallica on April 4, 2009. He was selected as the ninth greatest bassist of all time in an online reader poll organized <b>by</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone magazine in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was already}} under way in January 2005, when Baron Cohen caused a near riot in what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the final cut of the film.

5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} divided <b>by</b> <b>rolling</b> plains {{characterize the}} physiographically diverse watershed of the Snake River. The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where {{the headwaters of the}} Snake River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E
5|$|Some LARP rules {{call for}} the use of {{simulated}} weapons such as foam weapons or airsoft guns to determine whether characters succeed in hitting one another in combat situations. In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated weapons is to pause role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example <b>by</b> <b>rolling</b> dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5|$|The deltoid {{curve is}} {{another type of}} {{curvilinear}} triangle, but {{one in which the}} curves replacing each side of an equilateral triangle are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed <b>by</b> <b>rolling</b> one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with collinear endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the station}} was WZNF, it was a rock/classic rock station owned <b>by</b> <b>Rollings</b> Communications. At its height in the early 1990s, WZNF's signal was simulcasted into three {{additional}} markets. Those were WWDZ-FM (94.9 FM, Danville, IL), WZZP-FM (95.1, Kankakee, IL), and WZNX-FM (107.9, Charleston-Mattoon, IL). During this time, it employed the moniker [...] "Z95" [...] and then later [...] "The Fox".|$|R

Serving can vary widely to taste on either skewers or breads, with additional accompaniments or condiments. Angels on horseback differ from the similar, fruit-based, devils on horseback, but the dishes' names are sometimes erroneously considered synonyms.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} is <b>by</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone {{film critic}} Peter Travers, a voting {{member of the}} Golden Raspberry Awards Foundation. The book begins with selected quotes from the reviewers of such films as The Blue Lagoon, From Justin to Kelly, and Color of Night. The book also includes {{a brief history of}} the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson lists and discusses his picks of the 100 worst films of Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated <b>by</b> <b>rolling</b> hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E

5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized <b>by</b> <b>rolling</b> hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E
5|$|Another problem exposed <b>by</b> <b>Rolling</b> Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{the album}} was {{certified}} triple platinum, earning US$2.1 million. Later it was also certified quadruple platinum in 1990, and quintuple platinum in 2002. It was ranked <b>by</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone at #257 in The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In honor of the 35th anniversary of the release, {{it was announced that}} Nelson would perform the entire album live, with the accompainment of an orchestra directed by David Campbell during two shows on August 9–10, 2013 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California. In December 2014 the induction of Stardust to the Grammy Hall of Fame was announced; the record was included among the 2015 class.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Pastafarians in Crossville, Tennessee, were {{permitted}} to place a Flying Spaghetti Monster statue in a free speech zone on the courthouse lawn, and proceeded to do so. The display gained national interest on blogs and online news sites and was even covered <b>by</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone magazine. It was later removed from the premises, {{along with all the}} other long-term statues, {{as a result of the}} controversy over the statue. In December 2011, Pastafarianism was one of the multiple denominations given equal access to placing holiday displays on the Loudoun County courthouse lawn, in Leesburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat <b>by</b> <b>rolling</b> onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
