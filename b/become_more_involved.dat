5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle {{was located in}} an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path. Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants, and the circulation became better defined. Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center far removed from the convection. By later that day, the circulation began to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> with the remaining convection. Based on evidence of a weak warm-core, the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185miles (300km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|Political {{status for}} prisoners {{became an issue}} after {{the ending of the}} truce. Rees {{released}} the last of the internees but introduced the Diplock courts, and ended 'Special Category Status' for all prisoners convicted after 1 March 1976. This led first to the blanket protest, and then to the dirty protest. Around the same time, Gerry Adams began writing for Republican News, calling for Sinn Féin to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> politically. Over the next few years, Adams and those aligned with him would extend their influence throughout the republican movement and slowly marginalise Ó Brádaigh, part of a general trend of power in both Sinn Féin and the IRA shifting north. In particular, Ó'Brádaigh's part in the 1975 IRA ceasefire had damaged his reputation in the eyes of Ulster republicans.|$|E

The Zoological Society’s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.|$|E

By 1826 the Harmonists had woolen and cotton mills in operation as well as a steam-operated grain mill. The Harmonist society also ran a wine press, a hotel, post office, saw mills, stores, and a variety of farms. Here, under the business acumen and efficient management of Frederick Rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated trade and the markets of Pittsburgh and down the Ohio River. The Harmonists' competitors accused them of creating a monopoly and called on state government to dissolve the group. Despite the attacks, the Harmonists developed Economy into a prosperous factory town, engaged in farming on a large scale, and maintained a brewery, distillery, and wine-making operation. They also pioneered the manufacturing of silk in the United States.|$|E
25|$|It {{was after}} the provincial {{election}} of 1934, when the Conservatives were defeated, that Gardiner started to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in politics in the Conservative party, and politics in Forest Hill, then a small and affluent suburb of Toronto. He joined the Conservative Businessman's Association in 1934. He first ran for deputy reeve of Forest Hill Village council in 1935. In his first campaign he spent $800, when candidates normally spent $200. He went door-to-door canvassing and received the endorsement of past reeve Andrew Hazlett. A Jewish car dealer named Ben Sadowski, whom Gardiner had befriended at Parkdale and intervened in a fight, canvassed for Gardiner among Jewish families of the area. Gardiner won the post by 1,211 to his challenger's 919 votes. Gardiner {{would go on to}} serve as reeve of the Village of Forest Hill for twelve years.

25|$|A {{review meeting}} {{was held in}} May 2008, {{approximately}} 8 months after the restrictions began, which was attended by the Director of Liquor Licensing {{and members of the}} Aboriginal community. Oscar said the meeting was ‘the most important mins of our lives’. The views of people who attended were that women now felt more empowered, confident and able to participate in community-level discussions, the Valley was a much more quiet and safe place to live, and other Aboriginal communities had noticed the positive example set in the Valley. Alcohol restrictions had encouraged government and non-government agencies to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved,</b> a strong desire to not return to the chaos of pre-restriction times prevailed, and change needed to be substantial and long lasting. The people felt priority needed to be given to children’s health and welfare, and they wanted the next generation of children to be raised without alcohol affecting their lives, families were stronger and sober, old people were being cared for, young people were thinking about buying homes, and children were learning new skills. They also believed sly grogging had become an issue, communities with people suffering from FASD needed help, and if the restrictions were lifted, all of the confidence that now existed in the community would be ‘stripped away’.|$|E
