40|$|Equatorial x-ray {{diffraction}} pattern intensities (I 10 and I 11), fiber stiffness and sarcomere length were measured in single, intact muscle fibers under isometric conditions and during constant velocity (ramp) shortening. At {{the velocity of}} unloaded shortening (Vmax) the I 10 change accompanying activation was reduced to 50. 8 % of its isometric value, I 11 reduced to 60. 7 %. If the roughly linear relation between numbers of attached bridges and equatorial signals in the isometric state also applies during shortening, this would predict 51 - 61 % attachment. Stiffness (measured using 4 kHz sinusoidal length oscillations), another putative measure of <b>bridge</b> <b>attachment,</b> was 30 % of its isometric value at Vmax. When small step length changes were applied to the preparation (such as used for construction of T 1 curves), no equatorial intensity changes could be detected with our present time resolution (5 ms). Therefore, unlike the isometric situation, stiffness and equatorial signals obtained during ramp shortening are not in agreement. This may {{be a result of}} a changed crossbridge spatial orientation during shortening, a different average stiffness per attached crossbridge, or a higher proportion of single headed crossbridges during shortening...|$|E
40|$|Barnacle single {{muscle fibers}} were microinjected with the calcium- {{specific}} photoprotein aequorin. We have previously shown (Ridgway, E. B., and A. M. Gordon, 1984, Journal of General Physiology, 83 : 75 - 104) that when barnacle fibers are stimulated under voltage clamp and length control {{and allowed to}} shorten during the declining phase of the calcium transient, extra myoplasmic calcium is observed. The time course of the extra calcium for shortening steps at different times during the calcium transient is intermediate between those of free calcium and muscle force. Furthermore, the amplitude increases with an increased stimulus, calcium transient, and force. Therefore, the extra calcium probably comes from the activating sites on the myofilaments, possibly {{as a result of}} changes in calcium binding by the activating sites. The change in calcium binding may be due, in turn, to the change in muscle length and/or muscle force and/or cross-bridge attachment per se. In the present article, we show that the amount of the extra calcium depends on the initial muscle length, declining at shorter lengths. This suggests length-dependent calcium binding. The relation between initial length and extra calcium, however, parallels that between initial length and peak active force. The ratio of extra calcium to active force is therefore virtually independent of initial length. These data do not distinguish between a direct effect of length on calcium binding and an indirect effect owing to changes in cross- <b>bridge</b> <b>attachment</b> and force through some geometrical factor. The amount of extra calcium increases with the size of the shortening step, tending toward saturation for steps of {{greater than or equal to}} 10 %. This experiment suggests that calcium binding depends on muscle force or cross-bridge attachment, not just length (if at all). There is much less extra calcium seen with shortening steps at high force when the high force results from stretch of the active muscle than when it results from increased stimulation of muscle.

40|$|Considering {{the widely}} {{accepted}} cross-bridge model of muscle contraction (Huxley. 1969. Science [Wash. D. C. ]. 164 : 1356 - 1366), {{one would expect}} that attachment of angled cross-bridges would give rise to radial as well as longitudinal forces in the muscle fiber. These forces would tend, in most instances, to draw the myofilaments together and to cause the fiber to decrease in width. Using optical techniques, we have observed significant changes in the width of mechanically skinned frog muscle fibers when the fibers are put into rigor by deleting ATP from the bathing medium. Using a high molecular weight polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP- 40; number average mol. wt. (Mn) = 40, 000) in the bathing solution, we were able to estimate the magnitude of the radial forces by shrinking the relaxed fiber to the width observed with rigor induction. With rigor, fiber widths decreased up to approximately 10 %, with shrinking being greater at shorter sarcomere spacing and at lower PVP concentrations. At higher PVP concentrations, some fibers actually swelled slightly. Radial pressures seen with rigor in 2 and 4 % PVP ranged up to 8. 9 x 10 (3) N/m 2. Upon rigor induction, fibers exerted a longitudinal force of approximately 1 x 10 (5) N/m 2 that was inhibited by high PVP concentrations (greater than or equal to 13 %). In very high PVP concentrations (greater than or equal to 20 %), fibers exerted an anomalous force, independent of ATP, which ranged up to 6 x 10 (4) N/m 2 at 60 % PVP. Assuming that all the radial force is the result of cross- <b>bridge</b> <b>attachment,</b> we calculated that rigor cross-bridges exert a radial force of 0. 2 x 1. 2 x 10 (- 9) N per thick filament in sarcomeres near rest length. This force is of roughly the same order of magnitude as the longitudinal force per thick filament in rigor contraction or in maximal (calcium-activated) contraction of skinned fibers in ATP- containing solutions. Inasmuch as widths of fibers stretched well beyond overlap of thick and thin filaments decreased with rigor, other radially directed forces may be operating in parallel with cross-bridge forces...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the gas-phase {{structure}} of ubiquitin and its lysine-to-arginine mutants was investigated using ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and electron transfer dissociation-mass spectrometry (ETD-MS). Crown ether molecules {{were attached to}} positive charge sites of the proteins and the resulting non-covalent complexes were analysed. Collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments revealed relative energy differences between the wild type and the mutant crown-ether complexes. ETD-MS experiments were performed to identify the crown ether binding sites. Although {{not all of the}} binding sites could be revealed, the data confirm that the first crown ether is able to bind to the N-terminus. IM-MS experiments show a more compact structure for specific charge states of wild type ubiquitin when crown ethers are attached. However, data on ubiquitin mutants reveal that only specific lysine residues contribute to the effect of charge microsolvation. A compaction is only observed for one of the investigated mutants, in which the lysine has no proximate interaction partner.

40|$|How {{do people}} conceptualize a new landscape, {{is a study}} of {{research}} in archaeology with a long tradition. This paper proposes to approach the study of landscape through Belonging. With no prior theorization in archaeology, Belonging is developed through a multidisciplinary perspective to understand how people form attachments to landscapes. Belonging is then applied to {{the landscape of the}} San Emigdio Hills in south central California. This thesis both proposes four themes of Belonging: identity, emotional ties, instrumental ties, and performativity, and applies these themes to a rural case study. The post-colonial landscape provides an ideal data set, as issues of identity and Belonging are inherent, and are further magnified by the ever changing demographics of the rural landscape. The San Emigdio Hills in the modern period was inhabited by both homesteading families who lived in dual-gendered households and corporate households of the Kern County Land Company. Some corporate households are also nested dual-gendered households living in paternalistic situations, and are commonly linked to positions of power in the corporate structure. Tensions of the similarities and differences between dual-gendered and corporate households allows for the study of Belonging to occur. Households were both affected by the past landscapes they inhabited (emotional ties), particularly through chain migration from international and internal sources of similar ethnic backgrounds, such as Basque or Midwestern. Different ethnic groups expressed their Belonging in different ways. Both are affected in their instrumental ties by domestication of the landscape through Victorian notions of the domesticity / bread winner model, with the corporate households further affected by capitalism and corporate structure. The primary labour sector for the San Emigdio Hills is agricultural, particularly cattle husbandry performed by vaqueros. Finally, the aspects of performavity rooted in the work of Fortier and Butler, are applied to show how the two households utilized fences to express outward notions of gentility. Ultimately, three forms of Belonging are proposed, consisting of instrumental, imagined and <b>bridge</b> <b>attachments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Most {{adenovirus}}es bind to the coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Surprisingly, CAR is not expressed apically on polarized {{cells and}} is thus not easily available to viruses. Consequently, alternative mechanisms for entry of coxsackievirus and adenovirus into cells have been suggested. We have found that tear fluid promotes adenovirus infection, and we have identified human lactoferrin (HLf) as the tear fluid component responsible for this effect. HLf alone was found to promote binding of adenovirus to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner and also infection of epithelial cells by adenovirus. HLf was also found to promote gene delivery from an adenovirus-based vector. The mechanism {{takes place at the}} binding stage and functions independently of CAR.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to provide a}} structure for understanding the combinations of client attachment concerns, therapist interventions, and therapist interpersonal qualities that facilitate the development of strong therapeutic relationships by drawing upon the propositions of attachment theory and interpersonal theory. The first study supported the hypothesis that relationship incidents provide the relational information required for the client to feel secure enough with their therapist to explore in session. Following their third session, thirty volunteer clients seen by therapist trainees nominated an incident they felt was important to the development of their therapeutic relationship. General attachment was associated with the developing relationship with therapist, and this relationship was associated with exploration in-session. As expected, following a relationship building event, the client experienced the therapist as a safe haven from which to explore. The client's ability to attach to the therapist in the relationship building incident was related to avoidant attachment. Client in-session exploration, conceptualized as cognitive openness, was associated with the attachment-related relationship with the therapist, but not general attachment orientation. Within a framework that explicitly <b>bridges</b> <b>attachment</b> and interpersonal theory; the results of the second study offer differential support for the suggestions of interpersonal theory and attachment theory depending upon the attachment dimension in question. The predictions of interpersonal theory were generally supported in regards to clients with attachment anxiety; in relationship building incidents, therapists allowed themselves to be hooked by client interpersonal schemas however, they also refrained from eliciting emotions with these clients in early sessions. For clients high on avoidance, the results support suggestions from the attachment literature. Therapists met client distancing with proximity [...] -seeking interventions unhooking from client interpersonal expectations; however while doing so, therapists provided the client with a containing framework. Together these studies highlight the importance of client attachment {{in the development of the}} therapeutic relationship and extend the findings from attachment research in social psychology to the therapeutic situation.

40|$|There is now {{a strong}} if not urgent call in both the {{attachment}} and autism literatures for updated, research informed, clinically relevant interventions that can more effectively assess the mother infant dyad during early periods of brain plasticity. In this contribution I describe my work in regulation theory, an overarching interpersonal neurobiological model of the development, psychopathogenesis, and treatment of the early forming subjective self system. The theory models the psychoneurobiological mechanisms by which early rapid, spontaneous and thereby implicit emotionally-laden attachment communications indelibly impact the experience-dependent maturation of the right brain, the emotional brain. Reciprocal right-lateralized visual-facial, auditory-prosodic, and tactile-gestural nonverbal communications lie at the psychobiological core of the emotional attachment bond between the infant and primary caregiver. These affective communications can in turn be interactively regulated by the primary caregiver, thereby expanding the infantâ€™s developing right brain regulatory systems. Regulated and dysregulated bodily-based communications can be assessed {{in order to determine}} the ongoing status of both the infantâ€™s emotional and social development as well as the quality and efficiency of the infant-mother attachment relationship. I then apply the model to the assessment of early stages of autism. Developmental neurobiological research documents significant alterations of the early developing right brain in autistic infants and toddlers, as well profound attachment failures and intersubjective deficits in autistic infant-mother dyads. Throughout I offer implication of the theory for clinical assessment models. This work suggests that recent knowledge of the social and emotional functions of the early developing right brain may not only <b>bridge</b> the <b>attachment</b> and autism worlds, but facilitate more effective attachment and autism models of early intervention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{introduce}} {{femtosecond laser}} wound design combined with riboflavin/ultraviolet light-A (UVA) collagen cross-linking at the wound for penetrating (PKP) and anterior lamellar keratoplasty (ALK). Primary outcomes were intraocular pressure (IOP in mmHg) at burst {{point for the}} PKP group, and tensile strength (kPa) until dehiscence for the ALK group. MethodsHuman corneoscleral rims (N= 20) were mounted on artificial anterior chambers. PKP specimens underwent FUR, femtosecond laser-cut without cross-linking, or conventional corneal transplantation. PKP maximum burst IOP with progressive suture removal was assessed by a digital manometer, in triplicate and by three observers. ALK involved whole human globes (N= 10) divided into three groups using a 200 -micron, 8 mm diameter donor lenticule, with or without cross-linking. Cross-linked specimens were exposed to UVA light (3 mW/cm 2 irradiance, 3. 4 J, 370 nm wavelength) for 30 min with 0. 1 % riboflavin (20 % Dextran) applied every 2 -min. ALK tensile strength was determined using a digital tensiometer. ResultsIn PKP, burst IOP was 31. 32 mmHg greater for corneas that underwent the UVA-riboflavin treatment than for those that did not (p< 0. 05). There was no significant relationship (p= 0. 719) established between cut design (femtosecond versus conventional). On multivariate analysis, there was a mean of 15. 82 mmHg higher sustainable pressure for each stabilization suture present (p< 0. 0001). In ALK, specimens comprised of human donor and human recipient tissue combined with UVA-riboflavin therapy experienced the greatest level of adhesion strength (954. 7 Â± 290. 4 kPa) {{as shown by the}} force required to separate the tissues, and compared to non-cross-linked specimens. Electron microscopy of ALK specimens showed non-fused and fused longitudinal cross-linked collagen fibers as well as <b>bridges,</b> densities, <b>attachment</b> plaques and primitive plasmalemmal densities. ConclusionsCross-linking effects of the FUR technique enable a stronger graft-recipient adhesion compared to conventional penetrating and anterior lamellar keratoplasty. Electron microscopy enabled visualization of cross-linked interface and potential bonding. The FUR approach may further lead to sutureless transplantation techniques in the future.

40|$|Radioactive adenine {{is readily}} {{taken up by}} muscle and is {{incorporated}} into nucleotides as an intact unit. The rate of uptake is independent of the duration of incubation and increases with temperature. About 1 / 6 of the actin-bound ADP is rapidly exchangeable with free nucleotide in resting muscle. In isometric contraction there is a slight loss of tritium label from the 2 position of the actin-bound ADP. In loaded contracture there is a slight exchange of the actin-bound nucleotide {{over and above the}} resting exchange. The extent of this additional exchange seems to parallel the peak power output of the muscle. For a muscle contracting at maximum power, the probability that a bound ADP will exchange during a single interaction with myosin is about 0. 0005. Experiments in vitro show that, at high temperatures, the F-actin-bound ADP is labile and that the ATPase of the actin is dependent on the preparation of the protein. It is possible to calculate the length (along the thin filament) between the points at which any one cross <b>bridge</b> makes successive <b>attachments.</b> For the purposes of this calculation it is only necessary to know certain mechanical, energetic and geometric properties of muscle; no particular model of muscular contraction need be assumed.

40|$|The {{locus of}} {{community}} has been identified with the small town. With urbanization and industrialization, a shift occurred to spatially unbounded networks which are relationally defined {{and can be found}} in multiple contexts. The importance of community has long been recognized for both the individual and the society. Intentional communities represent attempts to create it. Examples include communes in the past, cohousing, gated communities, ecovillages and neighbornets. New Urbanist design attempts to create community through architecture and land use patterns, increasing the potential for people to come into contact with one another. The success of these efforts remains ambiguous. The Internet offers digital communities especially on social media sites. They represent a type of hybrid community today, a new structure. In the future, two demographic trends favor compact living arrangements and the potential for locality based community: the preferences of millennials who seem to want to abandon sprawling suburbs, and aging boomers who could benefit from the assistance of a supportive community. Environmental concerns and the need for action will also be locality based. Both the Internet and compact locality based communities offer the promise of social attachments, resurgent community.

40|$|Microdissection {{studies were}} done on 30 human adult hands and serial {{sectional}} investigation and neuromuscular spindle counts done on 132 intrinsic hand muscles. Neuromuscular spindle distribution charts were drawn {{for all the}} intrinsic muscles except the adductor pollicis; a corres-ponding extrafusal fibre relative length chart is also presented. A discussion of the methodology employed for spindle count and distribution charting is presented. The limitations of the spindle density values obtained by different methods is also discussed and an alternative numerical index or ratio is suggested. From the results several following conclusions have been drawn and emphasised: (a) There is a close correlation between zones of high neuromuscular spindle concentrations and the longer extra-fusal fibres within each individual muscle, and this association appears to be of functional significance. (b) There appear to be special qualitative features, within the biomechanical arrangement of {{the muscles of the}} thumb, index and middle fingers (the "precision tripod",) not seen on the ulnar side of the hand. (c) The lumbrical muscles have uniquely higher neuromuscular spindle densities than the other intrinsic muscles. The lumbrical <b>attachments,</b> <b>bridging</b> the flexors and extensors of the hand, and the simultaneous mobility of their origins and insertions on the tendons of these other muscles in theory renders them additionally sensitive to finger movements. Their motor role, on the other hand, appears of somewhat secondary and incidental nature, although so far attention seems to have been focussed upon the latter more than on the sensory role. Other results have been presented which indicate that there may be variations in the functional predominance of the wing or phalangeal tendons over the other.
