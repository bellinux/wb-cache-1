From 1970 - 2000, returns averaged 9 percent per annum, {{about the same}} as returns on a ten-year U. S. treasury bond. This reflects the combined effect of the 1980 s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989 - 2000. Annual returns since 1986 have been less volatile than emerging market equity returns but more volatile than returns on U. S. corporate or high-yield bonds. However, unlike returns on these bonds, emerging market debt returns do not seem significantly correlated with U. S. or world stock markets.

40|$|Within {{the next}} couple of months, the Greek government, is {{supposed}} to persuade private creditors holding about EUR 200 bn in its bonds to voluntarily exchange their existing bonds for new bonds that pay roughly 50 percent less. This may work with large creditors whose failure to participate in a debt exchange could trigger a Greek default, but may not persuade smaller creditors, who will be told that their claims will continue to be fully serviced if they do not participate in the exchange. This paper proposes an approach to dealing with this free rider problem that exploits the fact that with some probability, the proposed exchange might be followed by an involuntary restructuring some time in the future. The idea is to design the new <b>bonds</b> that <b>creditors</b> are offered in the exchange in a way that make them much harder to restructure than the current Greek government bonds. This is easy to do because the vast majority of outstanding Greek government <b>bonds</b> lack standard <b>creditor</b> protections. Hence, creditors would be offered a bond that performs much worse than their current bond if things go according to plan, but much better if things do not. They will accept this instrument if (1) the risk of a new Greek debt restructuring in the medium term is sufficiently high; and (2) there is an expectation that the next restructuring probably will not be voluntary...|$|R

While existing contractual provisions, and guidelines issued by creditor committees, establish fundamental principles about creditor treatment, they seem to remain too vague to guide debt restructuring processes effectively. The paper focuses on distribution, and argues that lack of clear guidelines for distribution may complicate and delay the resolution process and induce undue uncertainty about the predictability and viability of the restructuring outcome.

A large portion of the (S)ensitivity in CAMELS is interest rate risk.

Interest rate risk is unquestionably the largest part of the (S)ensitivity analysis in the CAMELS system for most banking institutions.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} and historical literature on debt mutualization in Europe with reference to pre- 1914 guaranteed bonds and current Eurobonds debate. We emphasize that, notwithstanding the differences in scale and nature, debt mutualization solutions similar to Eurobonds were tried before, and the closest historical examples to the present debate are the pre- 1914 guaranteed bonds. We highlight three key characteristics of debt mutualization, which are apparent both in the current debate and in history: moral hazard, debt dilution and conditionality. We show thatthe fears about short-run dilution and moral hazard were not unknown to pre- 1914 market participants. These problems were partly addressed by mechanisms of conditionality such as international financial control. The historical {{evidence suggests that the}} dilution of outstanding obligations may be overplayed in the current debate.

This paper studies whether sovereign bonds that are issued in foreign jurisdictions trade at a premium vis-a-vis domestic-law bonds. We use the Eurozone between 2007 and 2014 as a unique testing ground to assess this ``legal safety premium'' and collect secondary market bond yield data for the near-universe of Eurozone government bonds issued in foreign jurisdictions. Controlling for currency risk, liquidity risk, and term structure, we find that foreign-law bonds indeed carry lower yields on average. But a sizable premium only emerges for large values of credit risk (CDS spreads beyond 500 bp). At those levels, a 100 bp increase in CDS spreads {{is associated with a}} 30 - 80 bp larger yield premium on foreign-law bonds. In contrast, we do not find a premium for countries that are perceived as low risk.

Attitudes were changing, however, and the Bankrupts (England) Act 1825 allowed people to start proceedings for their own bankruptcy, in agreement with creditors. Previously only creditors could start the proceedings. Bankruptcy proceedings agreed between creditors and debtor also occurred when a trader filed a declaration of insolvency {{in the office of}} the Chancellor’s Secretary of Bankrupts, which was then advertised. The advertised declaration supported a commission in bankruptcy to be issued. A law was thereafter enacted, which declared that no commission grounded on this act of bankruptcy was to be “deemed invalid by reason of such declaration having been concerted or agreed upon between the bankrupt and any creditor or other person.” (Bankrupts (England) Act 1825, sections VI and VII). Voluntary bankruptcy was not authorized until 1849. (Bankruptcy Law Consolidation Act 1849, section 93 (1849)).|$|R

In this essay, we describe and compare three alternative approaches that would achieve an orderly restructuring but avoid an outright default: (1) “retrofitting ” and using a collective action clause (CAC) that would allow the vast majority of outstanding Greek government bonds to be restructured with the consent of a supermajority of creditors; (2) combining the use of a CAC with an exit exchange, in which consenting bondholders would receive a new English-law <b>bond</b> with standard <b>creditor</b> protections and lower face value; (3) an exit exchange in which a CAC would only be used if participation falls below a specified threshold.

This paper analyzes the effects of these spillovers using firm-level data from 31 emerging market economies. We assess how sovereign risk affects corporate access to international capital markets, in the form of external credit (loans and bond issuances) and equity issuances. The study first analyzes the impact {{of sovereign}} debt crises during the 1980 s and 1990 s. It goes on to examine the 1993 to 2007 period, using additional measures of sovereign risk-sovereign bond spreads and sovereign ratings-as explanatory variables. Overall, we find that sovereign default risk is a crucial determinant of private sector access to capital, be it external debt or equity. We also find that crisis resolution patterns matter and that defaults towards private creditors have stronger adverse consequences than defaults to official creditors.

60|$|To {{run counter}} to the law! That had ever been the chief object of the squire's ambition. To arrange {{everything}} so that it should be seen that he had set all laws at defiance! That had been his great pride. He had done so notably, and with astonishing astuteness, in reference to his wife and two sons. But now there had come up a condition of things in which he could again show his cleverness. Augustus had been most anxious to get up all the post-obit <b>bonds</b> which the <b>creditors</b> held, feeling, as his father well understood, that he would thus prevent them from making any farther inquiry when the squire should have died. Why should they stir in the matter by going to law when there would be nothing to be gained? Those bonds had now been redeemed, and were in the possession of Mr. Grey. They had been bought up nominally by himself, and must be given to him. Mr. Grey, at any rate, would have the proof that they had been satisfied. They could not be used again to gratify any spite that Augustus might entertain. The captain, therefore, could now enjoy any property which might be left to him. Of course, it would all go to the gaming-table. It might even yet be better to leave it to Harry Annesley. But blood was thicker than water,--though it were but the blood of a bastard. He would do a good turn for Harry in another way. All the furniture, and all the gems, and all the money, should again be the future property of Mountjoy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} Peru’s 2002 Article IV Consultation, First Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement, and a Request for Modification and Waiver of Performance Criteria. The {{fiscal policy}} was tightened in early 2002 from the expansionary stance {{in the second}} half of 2001. The baseline medium-term outlook is favorable, albeit not without risks. Assuming sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms continue, Peru should be able to achieve medium-term growth of 5 percent. However, the domestic political situation contains clear risks, potentially holding up tax reform and undermining fiscal discipline.

40|$|Using a multi-country {{panel of}} banks, we study whether better {{capitalized}} banks experienced higher stock returns during the financial crisis. We differentiate among {{various types of}} capital ratios: the Basel risk-adjusted ratio; the leverage ratio; the Tier I and Tier II ratios; and the tangible equity ratio. We find several results: (i) before the crisis, differences in capital {{did not have much}} impact on stock returns; (ii) during the crisis, a stronger capital position was associated with better stock market performance, most markedly for larger banks; (iii) the relationship between stock returns and capital is stronger when capital is measured by the leverage ratio rather than the risk-adjusted capital ratio; (iv) higher quality forms of capital, such as Tier 1 capital and tangible common equity, were more relevant.

40|$|Crises on {{external}} sovereign debt are typically defined as defaults. Such a definition accurately captures debt-servicing {{difficulties in the}} 1980 s, a period of numerous defaults on bank loans. However, defining defaults as debt crises is problematic for the 1990 s, when sovereign bond markets emerged. In contrast to the 1980 s, the 1990 s are characterized by significant foreign debt-servicing difficulties but fewer sovereign defaults. In order to capture this evolution of debt markets, we define debt crises as events occurring when either a country defaults or its bond spreads are above a critical threshold. We find that our definition outperforms the default-based definition in capturing debt-servicing difficulties and, consequently, in fitting the post- 1994 period. In particular, liquidity indicators are significant in explaining our definition of debt crises, while they do not play any role in explaining defaults after 1994.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Peru’s Second Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). Progress {{was made on}} {{structural}} reforms, but key reforms remain to be implemented, including the completion of tax reform and implementation of a fiscally neutral decentralization. Both are crucial to fiscal sustainability over the medium term but face considerable risks in the current political environment. The 2003 program aims at maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies, including moderate fiscal adjustment, and pressing ahead with structural reforms. Moderate fiscal adjustment is also needed to give credibility to the authorities' medium-term deficit target.

40|$|This paper-consisting of a {{regional}} study and seven country studies-reviews the state of domestic public debt markets in Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama as at end- 2005. Although they account for the lion''s share of capital markets, regional public debt markets remain underdeveloped {{for a variety of}} reasons. The problems of small scale, dollarization, and weak public finances in many countries are compounded by poor structure and composition of debt (with sizeable nonstandard and non-tradable components), fragmentation of public debt between central banks and the sovereigns and across instruments, poor debt management practices, weaknesses in securities market, and small investor bases all of which result in high transaction costs and a lack of liquid benchmarks. The paper also briefly discusses efforts towards and impediments to regional integration of public debt markets. The authorities recognize these problems and the paper takes note of the regional efforts to harmonize debt standards and improve issuance practices. It offers several recommendations to improve strategic debt management, issuance mechanics, and secondary trading.
