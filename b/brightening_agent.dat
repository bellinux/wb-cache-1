40|$|The paper {{industry}} is constantly {{looking for new}} ideas for improving paper products while competition and raw material prices are increasing. Many paper products are pigment coated. Coating layer is {{the top layer of}} paper, thus by modifying coating pigment also the paper itself can be altered and value added to the final product. In this thesis, synthesis of new plastic and hybrid pigments and their performance in paper and paperboard coating is reported. Two types of plastic pigments were studied: core-shell latexes and solid beads of maleimide copolymers. Core-shell latexes with partially crosslinked hydrophilic polymer core of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) and a hard hydrophobic polystyrene shell were prepared to improve the optical properties of coated paper. In addition, the effect of different crosslinkers was analyzed and the best overall performance was achieved by the use of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). Furthermore, the possibility to modify core-shell latex was investigated by introducing a new polymerizable optical <b>brightening</b> <b>agent,</b> 1 -[(4 -vinylphenoxy) methyl]- 4 -(2 -henylethylenyl) benzene which gave promising results. The prepared core-shell latex pigments performed smoothly also in pilot coating and printing trials. The results demonstrated that by optimizing polymer composition, the optical and surface properties of coated paper can be significantly enhanced. The optimal reaction conditions were established for thermal imidization of poly(styrene-co-maleimide) (SMI) and poly(octadecene-co-maleimide) (OMI) from respective maleic anhydride copolymer precursors and ammonia in a solvent free process. The obtained aqueous dispersions of nanoparticle copolymers exhibited glass transition temperatures (Tg) between 140 - 170 ºC and particle sizes from 50 - 230 nm. Furthermore, the maleimide copolymers were evaluated in paperboard coating as additional pigments. The maleimide copolymer nanoparticles were partly imbedded into the porous coating structure and therefore the full potential of optical property enhancement for paperboard was not achieved by this method. The possibility to modify maleimide copolymers was also studied. Modifications were carried out via N-substitution by replacing part of the ammonia in the imidization reaction with amines, such as triacetonediamine (TAD), aspartic acid (ASP) and fluorinated amines (2, 2, 2 - trifluoroethylamine, TFEA and 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 -heptafluorobuthylamine, HFBA). The obtained functional nanoparticles varied in size between 50 - 217 nm and their Tg from 150 - 180 ºC. During the coating process the produced plastic pigments exhibited good runnability. No significant improvements were achieved in light stability with TAD modified copolymers whereas nanoparticles modified with aspartic acid and those containing fluorinated groups showed the desired changes in surface properties of the coated paperboard. Finally, reports on preliminary studies with organic-inorganic hybrids are presented. The hybrids prepared by an in situ polymerization reaction consisted of 30 wt% poly(styrene- co-maleimide) (SMI) and high levels of 70 wt% inorganic components of kaolin and/or alumina trihydrate. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spcetroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) revealed that the hybrids had conventional composite structure and inorganic components were covered with precipitated SMI nanoparticles attached to the surface via hydrogen bonding.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of selective electrochemical metal deposition on ion implanted p-Si. The idea is that defects introduced into the substrate by ion implantation make it more susceptible to electrochemical reactions compared to intact Si; this increased sensitivity {{is to be used}} for selective reactions at the defect sites. It is believed that the increased reactivity is due to a lowering of the Schottky barrier breakdown potential, Ubd, of the semiconductor-electrolyte interface due to the introduction of additional energy states in the semiconductor's bandgap. These additional states may be used for facilitated charge transfer by direct tunnelling enabling spatially well defined electrochemical reactions at the implant sites. In a first step the damage created by ion implantation (Ga+ and Au 2 + by focused ion beam, FIB; Ga+ by broadband ion implantation, BII) was analyzed and compared to numerical simulations. Optical microscopy, REM, AFM, and Raman spectroscopy were for characterisation. It was found that the damage created was in good agreement with the theoretical models: more damage was created for heavier ions and higher ion doses. AFM proofed to be a valuable tool to assess surface sputtering for high implant doses, while optical microscopy was more sensitive for low doses. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the degree of amorphization of the substrate. We found that amorphization doses varied considerably depending on the implantation mode used. For BII the dose needed for amorphization was similar to values reported in the literature, while FIB implantation needed doses roughly 50 times higher. We assume that {{this is due to the}} very high current fluences in the FIB combined with short pixel dwell times during the implantation process; both these factors promote self healing of the substrate, hence a higher dose is needed for amorphization to take place. Deposition experiments at different potentials and in different electrolytes on samples implanted with varying doses lead to the following findings. Selective electrodeposition on ion implanted p-Si is possible, however, deposition conditions have to be chosen carefully. Low and high (close to or above the amorphization limit) implant doses lead to unsatisfactory deposits (sample not fully covered). We assume that in the first case, not enough defect sites are present for sufficient formation of initial nuclei, while in the second case the amorphous substrate seems to behave as an insulator making any deposition virtually impossible. Also, for the successful deposition of Cu from an acidic electrolyte, benzotriazole, a <b>brightening</b> <b>agent,</b> was added to improve deposit quality. The result were finely grained, even, and well delimited deposits with a resolution matching that of the implant process (~  200  nm). Deposition time and potential are crucial too, as long times and more cathodic potentials promote outgrowth, while short deposition times and potentials close to the open cell potential, ocp, may not suffice to cover the implant site completely. Microcapillary measurements were used to measure on either intact or implanted sites only, thereby minimizing other, undesirable influences. It was found that on intact Si, the Schottky diode stays intact down to potentials as low as several V, whereas on implanted Si reactions began to take place typically below - 500 mV indicating that the Schottky barrier has broken down. Also, amorphous samples showed a different behaviour from all the others without any distinct Ubd and an ocp shifted by several hundred mV towards more cathodic potentials. Finally, samples implanted by ion projection direct structuring, IPDS, were used to test the suitability for possible industrial applications. It was found that, even though implant conditions were quite different from before (noble gas ions at 75 keV vs. Ga+ at 30 keV) selective electrochemistry was still possible. Patterns as small as 150  nm were resolved over a surface of several mm 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{role of a}} color-managed inkjet {{proof is}} to predict and {{simulate}} the visual appearance of printed color. The proof-to-print visual match works well under different viewing conditions when the input ICC profile and the output ICC profile, built from characterization datasets, do not contain optical <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (OBA). OBAs influence printed color when measured for characterization and viewed. These <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> absorb UV wavelengths in the illuminant and fluoresce in the blue wavelengths. As more and more OBAs are used in printing paper production, the role of color proofing becomes more difficult. The difference {{in the amount of}} the UV component of the measuring and viewing light sources cause a problem where the OBA effect, as measured, may not be the same amount of OBA effect that should be proofed under the viewing illuminant. There are two objectives in this research project. The first objective is to show how printed colors, under identical printing conditions on OBA and non-OBA substrates, look different than when they are proofed using current characterization for proofing practices. Both M 0 (UV-included) and M 2 (UV-cut) measurement data are collected from color patches with selected tonal values and input ICC profiles created from this data are used to proof the brightened reference print. The results show that the UV-cut characterization treatment produces a very poor proof to the reference, while the UV-included proof was ranked as a fairly high match. A third commercially available software designed to improve upon the UV-included treatment, the X-Rite Optical Brightened Compensation module, was also tested and found to be a good match to the reference as well. The second objective is to propose different ways the characterization data can be adjusted for the OBAs in a reference print on brightened paper, by accounting for the influence of UV in the measurement illuminant, and the influence of UV in the viewing illuminant. By means of psychometric analyses, the results show that (1) the proof-to- print match is the worst when OBA in print and UV in the measurement illuminant are not addressed (UV-cut characterization data from M 2); (2) although not conclusive, the proof-to-print match improves when OBA in print, UV in the measurement illuminant (characterization data from M 0), and UV in the viewing illuminant are addressed...|$|R
40|$|A B S TRACT: Aqueous {{suspensions}} of sepiolite, tagged with fluorescent dyes, {{have been}} studied using electro-fluorescence polarization spectroscopy. The binding modes of some 37 fluorescent dyes and optical <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> to the rod-like sepiolite particles have been determined. Many of the dyes are found to bind {{with a degree of}} order to the clay particle's major axis. The binding geometries of the cationic dye molecules tested were found to be dependent upon molecular size. This supports the view that these cationic dye molecules are constrained within the channels which are characteristic of the mineral sepiolite. Results for uncharged and anionic dye molecules are also presented; no dependence of binding geometry upon molecular size was found. The anionic molecules are most likely to associate with the exterior cationic magnesium surface. The results indicate that some of the anionic dyes are too large to fit in the channels. Some of the uncharged molecules adopt a number of orientations upon binding which gives rise to an average geometry being observed for these dyes. Clay mineral particles are used extensively to improve the appearance, stability and structure of many manufactured products. They are also used i...|$|R
40|$|Some protozoans {{are able}} to encyst as a {{protective}} response to a harmful environment. The cyst wall usually contains chitin as its main structural constituent. Acanthamoeba is an exception since its cyst wall contains cellulose. Specific cytochemical differentiation between cellulose and chitin by microscopy has not been possible due to the similarity of the constituent β- 1, 4 -linked hexose backbones of these molecules. Thus, various fluorescent <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> and lectins bind to both cellulose and chitin. The identification of Acanthamoeba spp., which is based primarily on morphological and biochemical features, is labor-intensive and requires cloning and axenization. We describe a novel immunocytochemical method for identification of Acanthamoeba spp. based on selective binding of Trichoderma reesei cellulase to protozoan cyst wall cellulose. A recombinant cellulose-binding protein consisting of two cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) from T. reesei cellulases was coupled to the fluorescent dyes Alexa Fluor 350 and Alexa Fluor 568 or was labeled with biotin using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-biotin. No staining reaction was observed with chitin-containing preparations of fungi. Thus, the recombinant CBDs {{can be used as}} a marker to distinguish between cellulose and chitin. This allows rapid identification of Acanthamoeba cyst wall cellulose in paraffin or frozen sections of infected tissues...|$|R
