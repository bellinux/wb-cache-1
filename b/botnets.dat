5|$|The attacks {{brought down}} PayPal.com {{for an hour}} on December 8 and another brief period on December 9. Anonymous also {{disrupted}} the sites for Visa and MasterCard on December 8. Anons had announced an intention to bring down Amazon.com as well, but failed to do so, allegedly because of infighting with the hackers who controlled the <b>botnets.</b> PayPal estimated the damage to have cost the company US$5.5 million. It later provided the IP addresses of 1,000 of its attackers to the FBI, leading to at least 14 arrests. On Thursday, December 5, 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to {{taking part in the}} attacks.|$|E
25|$|These {{collections}} of systems compromisers {{are known as}} <b>botnets</b> / rootservers. DDoS tools like Stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered on IP spoofing and amplification like smurf attacks and fraggle attacks (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). SYN floods (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, <b>botnets</b> can be turned against any IP address. Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users. More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools {{for the purposes of}} extortioneven against their business rivals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Botnet</b> {{as a new}} {{technology}} of attacks is {{a serious threat to}} Internet security. With the rapid development of the <b>botnet,</b> <b>botnet</b> based several protocols came into being. In accordance with the feature of <b>botnet,</b> the Hidden Markov Model has application in <b>botnet</b> detection. Firstly, according to the situation and problems of the <b>botnet</b> recently, the life cycle and behaviour characteristics of the <b>botnet</b> have been analysed. After that a mathematical model based on state division has been built to describe the <b>botnet.</b> Meanwhile, a method of <b>botnet</b> detection based on this model has been proposed. Finally, we analyzed and summarized the experimental results, and verified the reliability and rationality of the detection method...|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 1, the three characteristics in modern <b>botnet,</b> namely highly polymorphic, intelligent and stealthy, make current <b>botnet</b> detection approaches miscellaneous and manifold. <b>Botnet</b> detection {{is essentially a}} process of detecting exposed <b>botnet</b> activities based on collected evidence.|$|R
50|$|On 25 October 2010, {{a team of}} Dutch law {{enforcement}} agents seized control of 143 servers which contained three command & control servers, one database server and several management servers from the Bredolab <b>botnet</b> in a datacenter from LeaseWeb, effectively removing the <b>botnet</b> herder's ability to control the <b>botnet</b> centrally. In an attempt to regain control over his <b>botnet,</b> the <b>botnet</b> herder utilized 220,000 computers which were still under his control, to unleash a DDoS attack on LeaseWeb servers, though these attempts were ultimately in vain. After taking control over the <b>botnet,</b> the {{law enforcement}} team utilized the <b>botnet</b> itself {{to send a message}} to owners of infected computers, stating that their computer was part of the <b>botnet.</b>|$|R

25|$|Malicious {{software}} {{used and}} {{spread on the}} Internet includes computer viruses which copy {{with the help of}} humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks, ransomware, <b>botnets,</b> and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users. Usually, these activities constitute cybercrime. Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, DDoS <b>botnets</b> such as DD4BC grew in prominence, {{taking aim}} at {{financial}} institutions. Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack {{will be carried out}} if a ransom is not paid in Bitcoin. Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom. The attackers tend to get into an extended extortion scheme once they recognize that the target is ready to pay.|$|E
50|$|While {{the seizure}} of the command and control servers {{severely}} disrupted the <b>botnet's</b> ability to operate, the <b>botnet</b> itself is still partially intact, with command and control servers persisting in Russia and Kazakhstan. Security firm FireEye believes that a secondary group of <b>botnet</b> herders {{has taken over the}} remaining part of the <b>botnet</b> for their own purposes, possibly a previous client who reverse engineered parts of the original <b>botnet</b> creator's code. Even so, the group noted that the <b>botnet's</b> size and capacity has been severely reduced by the law enforcement intervention.|$|R
5000|$|The Kelihos <b>botnet</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} around December 2010. Researchers originally suspected having {{found a new}} version of either the Storm or Waledac <b>botnet,</b> due to similarities in the modus operandi and source code of the bot, but analysis of the <b>botnet</b> showed it was instead a new, 45,000-infected-computer-strong, <b>botnet</b> that was capable of sending an estimated 4 billion spam messages a day. In September 2011 Microsoft took down the <b>botnet</b> in an operation codenamed [...] "Operation b79". At the same time, Microsoft filed civil charges against Dominique Alexander Piatti, dotFREE Group SRO and 22 John Doe defendants for suspected involvement in the <b>botnet</b> for issuing 3,700 subdomains that were used by the <b>botnet.</b> These charges were later dropped when Microsoft determined that the named defendants did not intentionally aid the <b>botnet</b> controllers.|$|R
5000|$|The Metulji <b>botnet,</b> {{discovered}} in June 2011, is a <b>botnet</b> mainly involved in cyberscamming and {{denial of service}} attacks. Before the <b>botnet</b> itself was dismantled, it consisted of over 12 million individual zombie computers infected with the [...] "Butterfly Bot", making it, as of June 2011, the largest known <b>botnet.</b>|$|R
25|$|Forum {{spamming}} is {{a breach}} of netiquette where users repeat the same word or phrase over and over, but differs from multiple posting in that spamming is usually a willful act that sometimes has malicious intent. This is a common trolling technique. It can also be traditional spam, unpaid advertisements that are in breach of the forum's rules. Spammers utilize a number of illicit techniques to post their spam, {{including the use of}} <b>botnets.</b>|$|E
25|$|Internet {{security}} firm CloudFlare said that, {{like for the}} attacks on PopVote sponsored by OCLP earlier in the year, the volume of junk traffic aimed at paralysing Apple Daily servers was an unprecedented 500Gbit/s and involved at least five <b>botnets.</b> Servers were bombarded with in excess of 250 million DNS requests per second, equivalent to the average volume of DNS requests for the entire Internet. And where the attacks do not succeed directly, they have caused some internet service providers to pre-emptively block such sites under attack {{to protect their own}} servers and lines.|$|E
25|$|Within a few years, {{the focus}} of {{spamming}} (and anti-spam efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today. Arguably, the aggressive email spamming {{by a number of}} high-profile spammers such as Sanford Wallace of Cyber Promotions in the mid-to-late 1990s contributed to making spam predominantly an email phenomenon in the public mind. By 1999, Khan C. Smith, a well known hacker at the time, had begun to commercialize the bulk email industry and rallied thousands into the business by building more friendly bulk email software and providing internet access illegally hacked from major ISPs such as Earthlink and <b>Botnets.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 2008 the Asprox <b>botnet</b> {{has been involved}} in multiple high-profile attacks on various websites in order to spread malware. The <b>botnet</b> itself consists of roughly 15,000 infected computers as of May, 2008, [...] although the size of the <b>botnet</b> itself is highly variable as the controllers of the <b>botnet</b> have been known to deliberately shrink (and later regrow) their <b>botnet</b> in order to prevent more aggressive countermeasures from the IT Community.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, <b>Botnet</b> {{has been}} used to launch spam-mail, key-logging, and DDoS attacks. <b>Botnet</b> is a network of bots which are {{controlled}} by attacker. A lot of detection mechanisms have been proposed to detect <b>Botnet</b> on wired network. However, in IP based sensor network environment, there is no detec-tion mechanism for <b>Botnet</b> attacks. In this paper, we analyze the threat of Bot-net on 6 LoWPAN and propose a mechanism to detect <b>Botnet</b> on 6 LoWPAN...|$|R

25|$|An {{example of}} an amplified DDoS attack through NTP is through a command called monlist, which sends {{the details of the}} last 600 people who have {{requested}} the time from that computer back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in 556.9 times the amount of data that was requested back to the victim. This becomes amplified when using <b>botnets</b> that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will send a massive amount of data back to the victim.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{a prison}} term of {{nearly five years}} was handed down to Jeanson James Ancheta, who created {{hundreds}} of zombie computers to do his bidding via giant bot networks or <b>botnets.</b> [...] He then sold the <b>botnets</b> {{to the highest bidder}} who in turn used them for Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.|$|E
500|$|On December 8, Anons {{launched}} {{an attack against}} PayPal's main site. According to Topiary, {{who was in the}} command channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the <b>botnets</b> of two hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault. Security researcher Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the [...] "zombie computers" [...] of involuntary <b>botnets</b> had provided 90% of the attack. Topiary states that he and other Anons then [...] "lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of abundance", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership. However, this account was disputed.|$|E
50|$|The Rustock <b>botnet</b> was a <b>botnet</b> that {{operated}} {{from around}} 2006 until March 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The Grum <b>botnet,</b> {{also known}} by its alias Tedroo and Reddyb, was a <b>botnet</b> mostly {{involved}} in sending pharmaceutical spam e-mails. [...] Once the world's largest <b>botnet,</b> Grum {{can be traced back}} to as early as 2008. [...] At the time of its shutdown in July 2012, Grum was reportedly the world's 3rd largest <b>botnet,</b> responsible for 18% of worldwide spam traffic.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{computer}} becomes infected by the trojan horse, the computer becomes {{known as a}} zombie, which will then be at the command of the controller of the <b>botnet,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} the <b>botnet</b> herder. The operation of the Srizbi <b>botnet</b> is based upon a number of servers which control the utilization of the individual bots in the <b>botnet.</b> These servers are redundant copies of each other, which protects the <b>botnet</b> from being crippled in case a system failure or legal action takes a server down.|$|R
500|$|The denial-of-service {{attacks on}} Scientology.org flooded the site with 220 megabits of traffic, a {{mid-range}} attack. Speaking with SCMagazineUS.com, a security strategist for Top Layer Networks, Ken Pappas {{said that he}} thought that <b>botnets</b> were involved in the Anonymous operation: [...] "There are circles out there where you could take ownership of the bot machines that are already owned and launch a simultaneous attack against [...] like the church from 50,000 PCs, all at the same time".|$|E
500|$|Reports of {{the actual}} size of the attack have varied. One cyber {{security}} expert described the attacks as [...] "the equivalent of parking a truck across the driveway of a shopping centre". A firm marketing security technology said that {{the peak of the}} attack was a relatively low 16.84 megabits per second. One writer described the 7.5 million requests per second that initially brought down the Parliament website as [...] "massive". The site usually only receives a few hundred per second. It appears that <b>botnets</b> made up of compromised computers were not used. Estimates of the number of attacking systems involved have ranged from hundreds to thousands.|$|E
2500|$|Appropriate the {{compromised}} machine as {{a zombie}} computer for attacks on other computers. (The attack originates from the compromised system or network, {{instead of the}} attacker's system.) [...] "Zombie" [...] computers are typically members of large <b>botnets</b> that can launch denial-of-service attacks, distribute e-mail spam, conduct click fraud, etc.|$|E
50|$|For {{information}} on the <b>botnet</b> composed of machines infected with this worm, see Storm <b>botnet.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} {{its initial}} infection routine the malware would contact a command-and-control server within the <b>botnet.</b> This {{command and control}} server {{could be used by}} the controllers of the <b>botnet,</b> in order to issue orders to the <b>botnet</b> itself.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{characterize}} a <b>botnet</b> {{using two}} essential coexisted behavior or evidence categories, namely (1) Infection and Attack (I&A) evidence denoted as E 1 that reflect <b>botnet</b> motivation, and (2) coordinated {{command and control}} (C&C) evidence denoted as E 2 that show the fundamental difference of <b>botnet</b> from other malwares. For detecting a <b>botnet,</b> we should observe evidences from E 1 AND E 2.|$|R
50|$|While <b>botnets</b> {{are often}} {{named after the}} malware that created them, {{multiple}} <b>botnets</b> typically use the same malware, but are operated by different entities.|$|E
50|$|Since most <b>botnets</b> using IRC {{networks}} and domains {{can be taken}} down with time, hackers have moved to P2P <b>botnets</b> with C&C {{as a way to}} make it harder to be taken down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{firm has}} worked with {{international}} law enforcement to help Microsoft dismantle four of the world’s largest <b>botnets,</b> introducing new tactics for combating cybercrime. They provide legal notices to these <b>botnets</b> through their botnetlegalnotice.com domain.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a <b>botnet</b> that was {{detected}} and analyzed by Spider.io in 2013 is the Chameleon <b>botnet.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports on}} Srizbi trojan outbreaks were around June 2007, with small differences in detection dates across antivirus software vendors. However, {{reports indicate that}} the first released version had already been assembled on 31 March 2007.The Srizbi <b>botnet</b> by some experts is considered the second largest <b>botnet</b> of the Internet. However, there is controversy surrounding the Kraken <b>botnet.</b> , {{it may be that}} Srizbi is the largest <b>botnet.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{income of}} the <b>botnet</b> was {{generated}} through leasing parts of the <b>botnet</b> to third parties who could subsequently use these infected systems for their own purposes, and security researchers estimate that {{the owner of the}} <b>botnet</b> made up to $139,000 a month from <b>botnet</b> related activities. Due to the rental business strategy, the payload of Bredolab has been very diverse, and ranged from scareware to malware and e-mail spam.|$|R
