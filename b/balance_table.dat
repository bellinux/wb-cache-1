The sample can also be enclosed in a thermostat in order to make measurements at different temperatures. Since it requires a large and powerful electromagnet, the Gouy balance is a stationary instrument permanently set up on a bench. The apparatus is often placed on a marble <b>balance</b> <b>table</b> in a non-ventilated room to minimize the vibrations and disruption from the environment. The stationary magnetic of a Gouy balance is often an electromagnet connected to a power source, since balance recordings with and without the applied magnetic field are required of the procedure.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers {{can use that}} utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at the}} University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most <b>balanced</b> <b>table</b> wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then multiply that number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be a good rule of thumb of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after going through that formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|R

Cooperative and reliable packet forwarding presents a formidable challenge in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), due to special network characteristics; e. g., mobility, dynamic topology and absence of centralized management. Lack of cooperation, due to misbehavior caused by selfishness or malice, may severely degrade the performance of the network. Previous studies, relying on a reputation system, have developed solutions designed for Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. The difference between Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and DSR requires examination and modification of these schemes to apply them to AODV.

Therefore, analysis of the current status of China’s carbon emissions is very important. After drawing a chart of China’s carbon flow in 2012, based on the IPCC carbon emission inventory method and China’s energy <b>balance</b> <b>table,</b> this paper gives a detailed description of the current status of China’s carbon flow and compares the changing characteristics of China’s carbon flow between 2008 and 2012. The results show that 75. 12 % of total CO 2 emissions flow mainly into several sectors, such as ferrous sectors, and the chemical industry in the terminal sub-sectors. Although China’s thermoelectric efficiency increased dramatically during past four years, emissions from the heat and power production sector are still increasing due to China’s large demand for heat and power. In the ferrous metal and chemical industry sectors, CO 2 emissions are mainly energy-related, while in the non-metallic mineral sector, CO 2 emissions are mainly from process CO 2 emissions. In different terminal sub-sectors, the main carriers of CO 2 flow are different, thus, related CO 2 reduction policies should also be targeted. In addition, some valuable suggestions are given in this paper...|$|E

In this work, assumed efficiencies for cooking devices are 27.5 % for kerosene wick stove, 65 % for electric stove, 50 % for LPG stove, 17.5 % for charcoal stove, and 14 % for wood and other biomass stoves. The shares of various energy carriers for cooking may vary {{from year to}} year, depending on access, availability and pricing of the energy carriers. Fuel shares used in this work for the base year {{are based on the}} need to account for fuels credited to have been consumed in the household sector in the energy <b>balance</b> <b>table</b> of 2005. The fuel shares and data matching were also repeated for subsequent years for which data were available, up till 2008. For 2009 and beyond, the fuel shares adopted for cooking are as published by the National Bureau of Statistics (2005) and these are 69.98 % wood, 26.55 % kerosene, 1.11 % LPG, 0.52 % electricity, 0.84 % charcoal, and 1 % other biomass (i.e. crop residues, animal wastes, etc.). It should be noted that electric cookers are only available in electrified households, while LPG cookers are mainly in urban areas and some rural areas close enough to major cities due to issues of availability of LPG. Future useful energy requirements for cooking are based on the projected population growth, fuel shares and the assumed useful energy intensity.|$|E

Some results are found in this research: (1) During 2005 – 2011, the energy consumption kept increasing, while the total CO 2 emissions fluctuated obviously in 2008 and 2011. The energy structure and the industrial structure have been optimized to a certain extent. (2) If the policies are completely implemented, the POL scenario is projected to save 21. 36 and 35. 37 % of the total energy consumption and CO 2 emissions than the BAU scenario during 2012 and 2030. (3) The POL scenario presents a more optimized energy structure compared with the BAU scenario, with the decrease of coal consumption and the increase of natural gas consumption. (4) The commerce and service sector and the energy conversion sector will become the largest contributor to energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, respectively. The transport sector and the industrial sector are the two most potential sectors in energy savings and carbon reduction. In terms of subscenarios, the energy conservation in transport (TEC) is the most effective one.
