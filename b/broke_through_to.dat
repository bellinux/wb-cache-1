5|$|In its engagements {{during the}} Perimeter battle, the KPA 13th Division, with 9,500 men, had forced South Korean troops into the Tabu-dong {{corridor}} and started advancing on Taegu. This division had battled the ROK 11th and 12th Regiments in the Yuhak-san {{area for a}} week before it <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the corridor on August 17. A regimental commander of the division said later it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process. On August 18, the 13th Division was concentrated mostly west of the road just north of Tabu-dong.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{established}} their fan {{base in the}} early 1990s through touring and the festival circuit—particularly in central Europe, where they first <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the mainstream. It was only after they had established a fan base in Europe and received positive press in the United Kingdom that the band first became recognized in the United States, including their native Atlanta. By the end of 1992, they were getting positive write-ups in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993. They also recorded a John Peel session on September 2, 1993 and a Black Session on February 25, 1994.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Laxa {{became the}} overall {{commander}} of all NDH authorities in Hum and Dubrava counties, which included Ustaše, Home Guard, civil administration, gendarmerie and police. Military courts were established {{to deal with}} those resisting the NDH authorities. Armed guards were posted at the entrance to towns and villages, and any armed civilians were to be disarmed and brought to military authorities. Laxa issued an order that gave the rebels until 2 July to submit to the authorities. On that day, after the Prohaska group <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Nevesinje from Mostar, Prohaska sent a company of the 6th Battalion to Kifino Selo to meet the two companies of the 11th Battalion advancing from Plužine. Despite ZNDH air support, the company of the 6th Battalion was attacked by rebels near the entrance to Kifino Selo and the majority broke and ran. Prohaska had to send reserves to block the road between Nevesinje and Kifino Selo, and the companies from the 11th Battalion began to reconnoitre the rebel positions towards Odžak.|$|E

5|$|When Mardonius {{heard the}} Allied army {{was on the}} march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army, {{under the command of}} the regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect {{themselves}} against such tactics. After several days of maneuver and stalemate, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards the Allies' original positions. This maneuver went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away near Plataea. Seeing that the Persians might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him. After this the Persian force dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Greeks, finalising the Greek victory.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius {{heard that}} the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army however, {{under the command of}} the Spartan regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect {{themselves}} against such tactics. Mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the Greek lines, but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed. The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp, still on high ground. As a result, the Allied lines of communication were exposed. The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies. The Allied position now undermined, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions. This went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away, near Plataea itself. Seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, as at Thermopylae, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him. The Persian force thus dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies, thus finalising their victory.|$|E

2500|$|The British 2nd Division, {{commanded}} by Major General John M. L. Grover, {{had begun to}} arrive at Dimapur in early April.

The British 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> Japanese roadblocks <b>to</b> relieve 161st Brigade in Jotsoma on 15 April. The British 6th Brigade took over 161st Brigade's defensive position (the [...] "Jotsoma Box"), allowing the 161st Brigade with air, artillery and armour support to launch an attack towards Kohima on 18 April. After a day's heavy fighting, the leading troops of the Brigade (1st Battalion, 1st Punjab Regiment) <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> and started <b>to</b> relieve the Kohima garrison. By this point, Kohima resembled a battlefield from the First World War, with smashed trees, ruined buildings and the ground covered in craters.|$|R

He became a regular in the team's reserves side during the following season, playing three-day, one-day, and Twenty20 matches in Franchise B tournaments. Mhora <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the Tuskers' senior side for two limited overs matches during the 2010–11 season, both played at the Queens Sports Club. He scored three runs on debut against the Mountaineers in September 2010, opening the batting with captain Gavin Ewing, and then made 23 from 25 balls the following month against the Southern Rocks, coming in third in the batting order. Mhora is yet to play any further matches for the franchise.|$|E

25|$|The High Horse Level {{had been}} started before the mine was {{abandoned}} in the 1810s, from the lowest possible point {{on the floor of}} the upper valley beneath Green Side. It was made wide enough and straight enough to allow horses to pull wagons of ore along it on narrow-gauge wooden rails. The new company drove this level forward, and in 1828 it <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> a sump (a vertical working) which had been made below Gilgower's Level. This created natural ventilation in the mine, and enabled the work to be expanded. By 1834 92 men were employed underground. The High Horse Level was continued northwards and in 1837 it crossed the northern boundary of the area shared by the two landowners.|$|E
25|$|General Ivan Fedyuninsky {{took the}} 13th Rifle Division from the reserve {{to support the}} 30th Guards Rifle Corps' {{offensive}} aimed at Auvere station on 15 February. Supported by heavy gunfire, the 45th Rifle Guard Division <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the railway again 500 metres {{to the west of}} Auvere station, but a powerful attack by German dive bombers pinned them down. The Tallinn railway, supplying the surroundings of Narva, was cut from two places, threatening to encircle the III SS Panzer Corps in the northeast. In the course of the action, the Soviet 30th Guards Rifle Corps lost of 7773 troops and ceased to exist as a combat-ready unit. Units of Army Group Narwa, supported by tanks, went on to counterattack, stopping the Soviet rifle corps' advance.|$|E
25|$|Williams's {{first film}} {{composition}} {{was for the}} 1958 B movie Daddy-O, and his first screen credit came two years later in Because They're Young.

50|$|Napoleon's {{plan was}} to attack in {{strength}} towards Burgos in between the armies of Blake and Castaños. Once they <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> they were <b>to</b> swing both north and south to envelope the remaining armies.

25|$|The {{attack of}} 6,000 Soviet {{infantry}} began at 0900, {{supported by a}} regiment of nearly 100 tanks (most of them of the heavy IS-2 variety). They used their 122mm guns to fire directly at the strongpoints showing any signs of life and destroyed the remaining bunkers. The remnants of the German advance guard were destroyed. The platoon commanded by Lt. Lapshin <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} Grenadier Hill. Special courage was shown by Sgt. Efendiyev, who destroyed a German strongpoint on the hill. The Komsomol organiser, V.I. Lavreshin of the 937th Rifle Regiment, who had been marching ahead of his troops with a red flag in his hands, erected it at the summit. The small German units who still resisted were paid no special attention by the Soviets, as the main attack was carried westwards.|$|E
25|$|Two days later, on 15 August—noted for the {{intensity}} and scale of combat—the Luftwaffe carried out effective attacks from Portland to Martlesham. At 17:00 43 squadron were scrambled with 249, 601 and 609 squadrons to intercept a large raid approaching Southampton. 43 Squadron and 234 Squadron made a sighting off Portland to south-east of the Isle of Wight. The raid consisted of 60 Ju 88s from LG 1 and 40 Bf 110s from Zerstörergeschwader 2 (ZG 2), led by Oberstleutnant Friedrich Vollbracht. The Ju 88s <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> RAF Middle Wallop and RAF Worthy Down but caused little damage. 4./LG 1, led by Hauptmann Joachim Helbig, lost five of seven Ju 88s to 601 Squadron. Carey accounted for one shared Ju 88 destroyed. LG 1 lost eight Ju 88s on the mission. One of the Bf 110 escorts was brought down and 43 Squadron suffered no loss but 234 Squadron lost two pilots and 601 lost two fighters with a badly burned pilot.|$|E
25|$|In the Six-Day War, Sharon, {{in command}} of an armored {{division}} on the Sinai front, drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's 38th Division faced when it <b>broke</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the Battle of Abu-Ageila led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering {{each other as they}} were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.|$|E
