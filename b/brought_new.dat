5|$|In the 2000s Unicamp {{consolidated}} {{itself as}} one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the total budget) constrain investment and expansion. This is further aggravated by the economic depression that Brazil is facing since 2014, the largest in the country's history.|$|E

For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened {{by the weight of}} metal coins.|$|E
5|$|In 1932twelve {{years after}} the ACLU was foundedit had {{achieved}} significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, {{and the general public}} was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general.

5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange <b>brought</b> <b>New</b> World crops such as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats to the Americas.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{hoped to}} produce a {{balanced}} depiction of religion, and he, Falchuk and series co-creator Ian Brennan worked {{to ensure that there}} was an equality between pro and anti-religious sentiments expressed. The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series' one-week debut high in the US. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances, with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> meaning to the songs.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|Prince Ivan III {{introduced}} Renaissance architecture to Russia {{by inviting}} {{a number of}} architects from Italy, who <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of Russian architecture. In 1475 the Bolognese architect Aristotele Fioravanti came to rebuild the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin, which had been damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century Vladimir Cathedral as a model, and he produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.|$|E

McLaren and Ferrari altered the brake ducts on their cars, improving the cooling {{to manage the}} high brake temperatures encountered in Montreal. Ferrari and Mercedes revised their rear suspension layouts, while Red Bull brought a new front wing optimised for a lower downforce level. Renault and Williams <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> rear wings, which were designed specifically for low-downforce circuits such as Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.|$|E
5|$|The National Hotel Artist Lofts (NHAL) is an Artspace-developed {{property}} featuring twenty-seven live/work units {{designated as}} affordable housing for artists. The project <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> {{life to the}} historic E.S. Levy Building, which was left abandoned for twenty years. Originally built as the Tremont Opera House in 1870, the structure was extensively renovated to serve various functions, from offices and stores to the National Hotel. The building also housed the U.S. National Weather Bureau's Galveston office under Isaac Cline during the 1900 Storm.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{freshman}} class of 1910 <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators {{had been elected}} through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More {{than half of the}} states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "digital revolution" [...] of the 21st {{century has}} <b>brought</b> <b>newer</b> {{technology}} to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the complementary metalâ€“oxide semiconductor active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) to generate {{a view of the}} glottis so that the trachea may be intubated. The Glidescope video laryngoscope is one example of such a device.|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. Omaha was a {{stopping}} point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or via the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha {{on its way}} to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. The Union Pacific Railroad was authorized by the U.S. Congress to begin building westward railways in 1862; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.|$|E
5|$|The empire's legacy {{includes}} many monuments spread over South India, {{the best known}} of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor.|$|E
5|$|The invasions <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> {{ethnic groups}} to Europe, {{although}} some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others. In Gaul for instance, the invaders settled much more {{extensively in the}} north-east than in the south-west. Slavs settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on, but distinct from, Latin, collectively known as Romance languages. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries. Greek remained {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|The mid-20th century <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> {{forms of}} music from Trinidad, Brazil, the United States, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to Barbados, and the Barbadian calypso style came {{to be viewed as}} lowbrow or inferior. Promoters like Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular {{tradition}} alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers {{set the stage for the}} development of popular Barbadian calypso in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{period after}} {{the defeat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588 <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> {{difficulties}} for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the standard of living fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the World Wars saw the {{election}} of reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia and the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of political dominance. As the city's demographics stabilized, labor unionization <b>brought</b> <b>new</b> protections and affluence to the working class, the city's government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under La Guardia. Despite the Great Depression, some of the world's tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 1930s, including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city's skyline today, most notably the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the GE Building.|$|E
