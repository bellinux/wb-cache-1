5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became very nervous {{in the days before the}} Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E

25|$|Inside was {{conceived}} {{as a kind of}} visual meditation. The work was developed along two parallel trains of thought. On the one hand, with a view to the emotional charge that is created when we sense the similarity of all human beings inside their nest.

500|$|Mickiewicz would, however, {{hold the}} Collège de France post for {{little more than}} three years, his last lecture being {{delivered}} on 28 May 1844. His lectures were popular, drawing many listeners in addition to enrolled students, and receiving reviews in the press. Some would be remembered much later; his sixteenth lecture, on Slavic theater, [...] "was to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> gospel for Polish theater directors of the twentieth century." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Jolins friend, GAN {{moved to}} Bastugatan 25, and in 1936, Jolin {{followed}} his example and rented {{an apartment in}} the same building, where he lived until 1943. At that time the street was home to numerous artists and writers. The Swedish writer Ivar Lo-Johansson, who had a studio apartment at number 21, described life in the area thus: [...] "In a part of a street, no longer than three hundred meters, everything existed. Bastugatan had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Montmartre to art, a concept." [...] In 1990, Lo-Johansson's apartment was converted into a literary museum by the Ivar Lo-Johansson Society.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} quatrain the poet {{describes}} {{that he has}} become quiet about the love he has for his muse, but this doesn't mean that his love is less. Rather, he claims that {{it is for the}} exact opposite reason. Carl Aitkins feels that the tone established here is like an tangential thought from Sonnet 100 and Sonnet 101. Publishing sonnets about his love have <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> currency. This is a use of a common proverb of the time: [...] "He praises who wishes to sell." [...] David West suggests that this may also be viewed as an attack at the Rival Poet, in an attempt to cheapen the Rival Poet's love.|$|E
500|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying {{to learn as much as}} possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the Virgin Mary in sorrow, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. [...] Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for mass, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did. A common theme was that Edgardo had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> prodigy—according to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic L'armonia della religione colla civiltà, he had learned the catechism perfectly within a few days, [...] "blesse the servant who baptised him," [...] and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the Jesuit periodical La Civiltà Cattolica in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. This story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative—that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: [...] "I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{cases of}} {{multiple}} personality {{began to emerge}} in the 1970s, they attracted the interest not only of therapists and the psychiatric profession, but also of the media. Awareness and discussion of Multiple Personality Disorder became widespread. Multiple Personality Disorder <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mental illness. It <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing that someone could have. This is what Hacking refers to as “semantic contagion” (p. 238). Before its meaning became prevalent in society, one could not describe oneself as <b>a</b> person <b>of</b> that <b>kind.</b> There were confused individuals who were (either deliberately or pre-reflectively) seeking to dissociate themselves from memories of painful events. These people, however, could not have described themselves as having the Disorder, nor could people in psychology diagnose their patients with this term. Once MPD <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing, it <b>became</b> <b>a</b> way for individuals to understand themselves and understand people around them.|$|R

2500|$|It {{is common}} for Thelemites to greet each other with [...] "93" [...] in person {{as well as in}} the opening and closing of written correspondence.

2500|$|Cabildos {{preserved}} African cultural traditions, {{even after}} {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886. At the same time, African religions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba, Haiti, other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as Lucumi or Regla de Ocha if they derived from the Yoruba, Palo from Central Africa, Vodú from Haiti, and so on. The term Santería was first introduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic saints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were genuinely members of both groups. Outsiders picked up the word and have tended to use it somewhat indiscriminately. It has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> catch-all word, rather like salsa in music.p171; p258 ...|$|E
2500|$|The June 18, 1945, {{issue of}} Life {{magazine}} stated: [...] "America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, {{made more money}} than any entertainer in history. Today he {{is a kind of}} national institution." [...] They also state: [...] "In all, 60,000,000 Crosby disks have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931. His biggest best seller is White Christmas, 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U.S. and 250,000 in Great Britain." [...] They go on to say: [...] "Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby's broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead. The day after he sings a song over the air – any song – some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the [...] "big goose" [...] and made it a hit single-handed and overnight." [...] and [...] "Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future. For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing – to himself." ...|$|E
