25|$|In art Gregory {{is usually}} shown in full pontifical robes with the tiara and double cross, despite his actual habit of dress. Earlier depictions {{are more likely}} to show a monastic tonsure and plainer dress. Orthodox icons {{traditionally}} show St. Gregory vested as a bishop holding a Gospel Book and blessing with his right hand. It is recorded that he permitted his depiction with a square halo, then used for the living. A dove is his attribute, from the well-known story attributed to his friend Peter the Deacon, who tells that when the pope was dictating his homilies on Ezechiel a curtain was drawn between his secretary and himself. As, however, the pope remained silent for long periods at a time, the servant made a hole in the curtain and, looking through, beheld a dove seated upon Gregory's head with its beak <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> When the dove withdrew its beak the pope spoke and the secretary took down his words; but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the dove had replaced its beak <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he made his last film, Querelle (1982), Fassbinder was using drugs and alcohol {{as a way to}} assist his unrelenting schedule. On the night of 9–10 June 1982, Wolf Gremm, {{director}} of the film Kamikaze 1989 (1982), which starred Fassbinder, was staying in his apartment. Early that evening, Fassbinder retired to his bedroom. He was working on notes for a future film, Rosa L, based on the life of Polish-German revolutionary socialist Rosa Luxemburg. Fassbinder was watching television while reading when, shortly after 1 a.m., he {{received a phone call from}} his friend and assistant Harry Baer. At 3:30 a.m, when Juliane Lorenz arrived home, she heard the noise of the television in Fassbinder's room, but she could not hear him snoring. Though not allowed to enter the room uninvited, she went in and discovered his lifeless body with a cigarette still <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> A thin ribbon of blood trickled from one nostril.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E

Mr. de Mountford 'e was quite calm, sir, didn't look at all as if 'e'd been 'aving a quarrel.

60|$|He took me {{down into}} the study, seated himself in his {{accustomed}} chair, and put me before him <b>between</b> <b>his</b> knees. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> were awfully white, and I felt his two hands, as they grasped my shoulders, shaking violently.|$|R

2500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster—a 16-year-old {{with cancer}} that {{has spread to}} her lungs—attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At first she hesitates because she feels like it has done her nothing. She thinks {{attending}} the support group could be {{the worst part of}} her life, until a particular support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. On catching Augustus stare at her, Hazel feels weird. They meet after the Support Group and converse on {{the fact that they were}} not [...] "literally" [...] in the heart of Jesus, but in a basement. When everything seems to go well, Augustus pulls out a cigarette and puts it <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by this, goes to his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E
60|$|The {{cigarette}} trembled <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{with laughter}} as he spoke.|$|E
60|$|He blinked twice, {{and put the}} {{meerschaum}} back <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Stephen Dallison {{placed a}} {{cigarette}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> moustacheless <b>lips,</b> always rather screwed up, {{and ready to}} nip with a smile anything that might make him feel ridiculous.|$|R
60|$|Now {{it was my}} turn to be tempted, but I, too, overcame, and, sitting down, laid Higgs's head upon my knee; then, drop by drop, let {{a little}} of the water trickle <b>between</b> <b>his</b> swollen <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|Heron muttered {{something}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> fleshy <b>lips,</b> {{then he turned}} back towards the open door, solemnly spat twice on the threshold, and nodded his gaunt head once or twice in a manner which apparently was understood from within.|$|R
60|$|He {{rolled his}} cigar <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and puffed clouds of smoke.|$|E
60|$|Captain Armstrong muttered {{something}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{that she did}} not catch.|$|E

6000|$|... '"Hire {{whom you}} please," [...] says the elder; [...] "we are ruled by you, body and soul"; and the younger, who shook most when I kissed 'em, says <b>between</b> <b>his</b> white <b>lips,</b> [...] "I {{think you have}} power to make a god of a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rascal!" [...] {{he muttered}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> {{compressed}} <b>lips.</b> [...] "He heard at breakfast, {{as well as}} the rest of us, that Milly wanted no intruders. Humph! I had given him credit for better taste than this implies. Eh! come, sir, this is quite inexcusable!" ...|$|R
60|$|Power swayed for {{a single}} moment upon his feet. The teeth gleamed <b>between</b> <b>his</b> {{slightly}} parted <b>lips.</b> <b>His</b> great arm was outstretched, its bursting muscles showing against {{the sleeve of his}} dinner coat. His chest was heaving.|$|R
60|$|Breakfast over, Mr. Scobell {{replaced}} {{the remains of}} his cigar <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and turned to business.|$|E
60|$|The sailor {{took his}} newly-lighted pipe from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{and stared at}} the Captain in astonishment.|$|E
60|$|He put the {{cigarette}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> {{drew a deep}} breath, then slowly sent the smoke down his nostrils.|$|E
60|$|After dinner, as I {{was leaning}} {{with my back}} against the gunwale on the {{starboard}} side, {{he came out of}} the only private cabin that the vessel boasted, and taking up a position opposite to me, with his legs well apart and a big cigar <b>between</b> <b>his</b> thick <b>lips,</b> stood coolly regarding me, as if appraising me.|$|R
60|$|Dismounting, I laid Powell {{upon the}} ground, {{but the most}} {{painstaking}} examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life. I forced water from my canteen <b>between</b> <b>his</b> dead <b>lips,</b> bathed <b>his</b> face and rubbed his hands, working over him continuously {{for the better part}} of an hour in the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "So, my pretty Scarlet Pimpernel," [...] {{he muttered}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> closed <b>lips,</b> [...] "you wish to meddle in my affairs, {{to have for}} {{yourself}} and your friends the credit and glory of snatching the golden prize from the clutches of these murderous brutes. Well, we shall see! We shall see which is the wiliest--the French ferret or the English fox." ...|$|R
60|$|Irvine thrust <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{the little}} finger of each hand and lent to her efforts a shrill whistling.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{slipped the}} little glass tube <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> {{and the doctor}} nodded when he passed it back to him.|$|E
60|$|The captain {{leaned back}} in his arm-chair, and turned his {{toothpick}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> as he stared hard at the girl.|$|E
60|$|The foam {{burst out}} from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> pallid, quivering <b>lips,</b> and <b>his</b> eyes, red and burning, {{suddenly}} closed. A ghastly change crept over his blood-stained, pallid face. He sank backwards and fell heavily upon the floor.|$|R
60|$|The citizen-deputies, drowsy {{after the}} long, oppressive day, seemed to rouse {{themselves}} to renewed interest. Lebrun, like a big, shaggy dog, shook himself free from creeping somnolence. Robespierre smiled <b>between</b> <b>his</b> thin <b>lips,</b> and looked across at Merlin {{to see how}} the situation affected him. The enmity between the Minister of Justice and Citizen Déroulède was well known, and everyone noted, with added zest, that the former wore a keen look of anticipated triumph.|$|R
60|$|Anson {{studied his}} {{right-hand}} {{man for a}} moment, then, taking out his tobacco-pouch, he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely to roll a cigarette. He put it <b>between</b> <b>his</b> thin <b>lips</b> and apparently forgot to light it. For a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and some scant sage-brush. Riggs took to pacing up and down. Wilson leaned as before against the cedar. The girl slowly recovered from her excess of anger.|$|R
60|$|Manuma {{was making}} a net. He sat with a {{cigarette}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{and looked up at}} Walker with a smile of triumph.|$|E
60|$|Mose was silent. Mary's letter had thrust itself <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and Cora's shapely head, and {{all thought}} of {{marriage}} {{with her was}} gone.|$|E
6000|$|As he vouchsafed {{no answer}} to question, {{although}} Sir Robert muttered an uncomplimentary one <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> which Barbara heard, or read, she continued: ...|$|E
6000|$|His heart gave a great leap, but he {{controlled}} himself. Intuitively he {{knew how}} much was permitted to him; {{he seemed to have}} even some faint perception of the cause for her strange request. He bent over and took her face for a moment <b>between</b> <b>his</b> hands; her <b>lips</b> touched his--she had kissed him! ...|$|R
60|$|Closer {{and closer}} danced the hideous chief, his yellow, sharp-filed teeth {{showing in the}} firelight <b>between</b> <b>his</b> thick, red <b>lips.</b> Now bending double, now {{stamping}} furiously upon the ground, now leaping into the air, he danced step by step in the narrowing circle that would presently bring him within spear reach of the intended feast.|$|R
60|$|Etienne {{turned his}} weary {{eyes to the}} corner which was being {{indicated}} to him. There he saw a huge creature sprawling across a bench, with long, powerful limbs stretched out before him. Citizen Rateau was clothed, rather than dressed, in a soiled shirt, ragged breeches and tattered stockings, with shoes down at heel and faded crimson cap. His face looked congested and sunken about the eyes; {{he appeared to be}} asleep, for stertorous breathing came at intervals from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> parted <b>lips,</b> whilst every now and then a racking cough seemed to tear at his broad chest.|$|R
