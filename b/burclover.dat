50|$|<b>Burclover</b> {{is a good}} forage for livestock, but {{the fruit}} is prickly. All classes of livestock, except horses and mules, can feed its leaves.|$|E
50|$|Medicago arabica (spotted medick, spotted <b>burclover,</b> heart clover) is a {{flowering}} plant {{of the family}} Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean basin but is found throughout the world. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium medicae, which is capable of nitrogen fixation.|$|E
50|$|Mountain {{leafhopper}} (Colladonus montanus) overwinters on winter annual weeds, particularly near {{streams and}} canals. Adults can be plentiful on sugarbeet during late winter/spring and migrate to favored weed hosts such as curly dock or <b>burclovers</b> in orchards. The Mountain leafhopper is most abundant vector found on cherry {{but does not}} reproduce on cherry. The mountain leafhopper (Colladonus montanus) spreads the disease from wild herbaceous hosts to woody hosts. It is believed {{that it is more}} responsible for the introduction of the disease into cherry trees, then in transferring them from cherry tree to cherry tree in an orchard. The cherry leafhopper (Fieberiella florii) reproduces on a broad range of woody hosts. The cherry leafhopper is more important in vectoring the disease from tree to tree within an orchard, since cherry is a favored host. After a leafhopper feeds on an infected host the pathogen has to undergo a latent period. During the latent period the pathogen spreads and multiplies inside the vector. Depending on temperature and the vector, the average latent period for the cherry x disease is about a month or longer. The phytoplasma is then transmitted from the leafhopper to the tree when the leafhopper is feeding on the trees phloem. It's then spread throughout the tree becoming systemic. July through October is when the highest concentrations of pathogen are present in leaves of infected trees.|$|R
50|$|Medicago polymorpha is a {{plant species}} of the genus Medicago. It is native to the Mediterranean basin but is found {{throughout}} the world. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium medicae, which is capable of nitrogen fixation. Common names include California <b>burclover,</b> toothed bur clover, toothed medick and burr medic.|$|E
50|$|Medicago is a genus of {{flowering}} plants, {{commonly known as}} medick or <b>burclover,</b> in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (M. sativa), an important forage crop, and the genus name {{is based on the}} Latin name for that plant, medica, from μηδική (πόα) median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. arborea) is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in Medicago range from 2n = 14 to 48.|$|E
50|$|New {{seedlings}} have seed {{leaves that}} are oblong. The first true leaf is rounded. Later leaves will be tripartite, with a characteristic clover-like shape, appearing alternately on the stems. Leaflets have slightly serrated edges. The tiny yellow flowers attract small butterflies and other pollinating insects. Full grown plant stems {{are up to}} 2 feet (60 cm) long, and usually sprawl along and/or under the ground. The stems often root at the nodes; adult plants, and even young plants that {{have been able to}} grow for a few weeks undisturbed can be very difficult to pull out, leaving behind tap roots and a network of plant pieces when pulled. Mechanically removing top growth from this plant will not usually eradicate it. If not properly managed, <b>burclover</b> may then become invasive and displace more desirable vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mountain}} leafhopper survives on winter {{annual weeds}} during winter, usually near stream banks or canals. In late winter or spring, adults {{can be found}} in sugar beet fields and can then migrate to favored weed hosts (curly dock, burclovers) in orchards. The mountain leafhopper is most often the abundant vector found on cherry, however, cherry is not the preferred host and the leafhopper does not reproduce on cherry. Preferred hosts for the mountain leafhopper are; alfalfa, California <b>burclover,</b> clovers, curly dock, and sweet clovers. Of the preferred hosts alfalfa and curly dock cannot become infected with the disease itself but are just a host for the leafhopper. Occasional hosts are; vetches (in legume family) and sweet cherry. It’s believed that the role of this leafhopper is introducing the disease into cherry orchards rather than spreading the disease between cherry trees within an orchard.(http://ucanr.org/sites/cccoopext/files/80935.pdf) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatments}} that included 2, 4 -D, mecoprop, and dicamba effectively controlled <b>burclover</b> and malva in the dormant bermudagrass turf. The addition of carfentrazone to the hormonal herbicides (Speedzone*) appeared to enhance malva control {{earlier than the}} other treatments. Surge* containing sulfentrazone with hormonal herbicides gave the highest degree of malva control. Fluroxypyr (Spotlight*) was not effective against <b>burclover</b> and showed moderate control of malva in this test...|$|E
40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{determine}} the ability of alternate host plants, specifically “ground vegetation, ” in or near almond orchards or vineyards to serve as reservoirs for Xylella fastidiosa (Xf). We surveyed ground vegetation in ALS-infected almond orchards in California’s Central Valley. Plant tissue samples were collected throughout a 2 year period and processed for Xf presence using restriction enzyme digestion of RST 31 -RST 33 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products and bacterial culture on selective media. Overall incidence of Xf was low in the ground vegetation species, only 63 of 1369 plant samples tested positive. Of the 37 species of common ground vegetation sampled, 11 tested positive for Xf, including such common species as Sheperd’s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), filaree (Erodium spp.), cheeseweed (Malva parvifolia), <b>burclover</b> (Medicago polymorpha), annual bluegrass (Poa annua) London rocket (Sisymbrium irio), chickweed (Stellaria media). There was a seasonal component to bacterial presence, with positive samples found only between November and March. Both ground vegetation and almond trees were most commonly infected with the almond strain of Xf (6 of 7 surveyed sites). ALS-infected almond samples had a Xf concentration within reported ranges, however, we were unable to accurately measure Xf titer in sampled ground vegetation for comparison...|$|E

40|$|Plants {{are rich}} source of {{antibacterial}} agents because they produce wide array of bioactive molecules, most of which probably evolved as chemical defense against predation or infection. A {{major part of the}} total population in developing countries still uses traditional folk medicine obtained from plant resources With an estimation of WHO that as many as 80 % of world population living in rural areas rely on herbal traditional medicines as their primary health care, the study on properties and uses of medicinal plants are getting growing interests. In recent years this interest to evaluate plants possessing antibacterial activity for various diseases is growing. Different solvent extracts (aqueous, alcohol and ethanol) of leaves, flower and seed of various plants selected based on an ethnobotanical survey from India were subjected to in vitro antibacterial activity assay against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria employing different diffusion method. Based on local use of common diseases and Ethnobotanical knowledge, an attempt has been made to assess the antibacterial properties of selected medicinal plants viz. Argemone mexicana (Shialkanta), Aster lanceolatus (White panicle), Capparis thonningii and Capparis tomentosa (Woolly caper bush), Cardiospermum halicacabum (Balloonvine), Cassia alata (Herpetic alata), Centaurea sclerolepis, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (Cinnamon), Curcuma longa (Turmeric), Cymbopogon nervatus, Ficus religiosa (Peepal), Indigofera aspalathoides (Ajara), Marrubium vulgare (Horehound), Medicago Spp. (Medick, <b>Burclover),</b> Morus alba (Mulberry), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi), Origanum marjorana (Marjoram), Oxalis corniculata (Amli), Piper nigrum (Kala mirch), Plectranthus amboinicus (Indian borage, Patharchur), Plumeria acutifolia (Kachuchi), Salvadora persica (Piludi), Salvia repens and Syzygium aromaticum (Clove) for potential antibacterial activity against some important bacterial strains, namely Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas spp, Proteus spp, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae. The plant extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative bacteria. [J Intercult Ethnopharmacol 2012; 1 (1. 000) : 52 - 61...|$|E
