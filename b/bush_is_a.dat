25|$|Eremophila sturtii, {{commonly}} known as turpentine <b>bush,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shrub endemic to Australia. Aboriginal people give it names including munyunpa and watara. A medium to large shrub, it is often multi-stemmed and has narrow leaves and lilac-coloured to pale mauve flowers. It is widespread and common in the drier parts of Australia and occurs in all mainland states, although it is endangered in Victoria. It is sometimes regarded as a weed, partly because {{of its ability to}} reproduce vegetatively.|$|E

Although Bush's support {{of the death penalty}} is known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist Tucker Carlson revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of Karla Faye Tucker in an interview.|$|E

25|$|Banksia nobilis, {{commonly}} known as the golden dryandra, great dryandra or kerosene <b>bush,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shrub of the family Proteaceae which is endemic to Western Australia. It occurs on lateritic rises from Eneabba to Katanning in the state's Southwest Botanic Province. With large pinnatifid leaves with triangular lobes, and a golden or reddish pink inflorescence, it is a popular garden plant. It was known as Dryandra nobilis until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. There are two subspecies, B. nobilis subsp. nobilis and B. nobilis subsp. fragrans.|$|E
500|$|Adenanthos cuneatus, {{also known}} as coastal jugflower, flame bush, bridle bush and sweat <b>bush,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shrub of the family Proteaceae native to the [...] south coast of Western Australia. [...] The French naturalist Jacques Labillardière {{originally}} described it in 1805. Within the genus Adenanthos, it lies in the section Adenanthos and is most closely related to A.stictus. A. cuneatus has hybridized with four other species of Adenanthos. [...] Growing to [...] high and wide, it is erect to prostrate in habit, with wedge-shaped lobed leaves covered in fine silvery hair. The single red flowers are insignificant, and appear all year, though especially in late spring. The reddish new growth occurs over the summer.|$|E

She asked me to 'stand by for emails explaining George <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great statesman, torture is justified in many circumstances and those Iraqi insurgents should just get over it'." ...|$|E

500|$|Banksia sessilis, {{commonly}} known as parrot <b>bush,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> species of shrub or tree in the plant genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. It had been known as Dryandra sessilis until 2007, when the genus Dryandra was sunk into Banksia. The Noongar peoples know the plant as Budjan or Butyak. Widespread throughout southwest Western Australia, it is found on sandy soils over laterite or limestone, often as an understorey plant in open forest, woodland or shrubland. Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to [...] in height, it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow flowerheads. Flowering from winter through to late spring, it provides a key source of food—both the nectar and the insects it attracts—for honeyeaters in the cooler months, and species diversity is reduced in areas where {{there is little or}} no parrot bush occurring. Several species of honeyeater, some species of native bee, and the European honey bee seek out and consume the nectar, while the long-billed black cockatoo and Australian ringneck eat the seed. The life cycle of Banksia sessilis is adapted to regular bushfires. Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards, each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets.|$|E

2500|$|In 1918, Bush's {{batting average}} dropped 47 points from the prior season to [...]234.

[...] Baseball Magazine that same year published a feature story on how a player's hands make him suitable for one position or another. The author wrote: [...] "Donie <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wonderful shortstop all will agree. <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> little man perhaps the shortest of stature in organized baseball. But his hand is very broad, thick and bony as well as freckled. It is a typical scoop hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2002, Lawrence MacAulay {{was forced}} to resign as Solicitor General {{following}} a ruling from the ethics counselor Howard Wilson that MacAulay had broken conflict-of-interest rules by lobbying the government to fund a police training scheme at Holland College, which was headed by his brother. Both Chrétien and his close associate man Eddie Goldenberg saw the charges against MacAulay as absurd, with Chrétien telling Wilson [...] "Do you want us to be eunuchs in our jobs?" [...] On November 21, 2002, Chrétien's communications director Françoise Ducros was overheard by Robert Fife saying about President Bush [...] "What a moron!", who reported the remark in the next day's edition of The National Post. The next day, Chrétien told the press that Bush was a friend and [...] "He's not a moron at all", leading to headlines in the press such as [...] "Chrétien denies <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> moron". Chrétien was highly reluctant to fire Ducros, who was one of his most loyal supporters. That Ducros was especially hated by the Martin fraction of the Liberals was another reason why Chrétien did not wish to fire Ducros, despite the media storm she had provoked. Finally, under strong pressure from the American government, which had quietly {{made it clear that the}} continued presence of Ducros would not help Canadian-American relations, Chrétien dismissed Ducros on November 26, 2002. Ducros's successor as communications director, Jim Munson, was a former journalist and a better-liked personality, which led to a marked improvement in the Chrétien government's relations with the media in its last year.|$|E
