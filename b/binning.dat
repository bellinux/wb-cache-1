5|$|France {{hosted the}} 2007 World Cup, {{and the two}} teams met in the tournament quarter-finals. Despite France's hosting of the tournament, the match {{was held at the}} Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The match was won by France 2018, and {{involved}} several controversial decisions by referee Wayne Barnes, who subsequently received death threats from some fans. France scored one try after the sin <b>binning</b> of All Blacks second five-eighth Luke McAlister, and another from a forward pass unseen by the referee. The All Blacks were strongly criticised for not attempting a drop goal in the game's final minutes. Their performance was analysed by Palmerston North based company Verusco who had analysed 1,500games since 2000. They discovered that the All Blacks made 57 tackles to France's 269, and they had 66 percent possession and 60 percent territory. The playing time, that is time the ball is in play, was the longest of any game Verusco had ever recorded.|$|E

The result of summing these kernels is given on the right figure, which is a kernel density estimate. The most striking difference between kernel density estimates and histograms is that the former are easier to interpret since they do not contain artifices induced by a <b>binning</b> grid.|$|E

500|$|Gene {{annotations}} {{provide the}} [...] "what", while measurements of species diversity provide the [...] "who". In order to connect community composition and function in metagenomes, sequences must be binned. <b>Binning</b> {{is the process}} of associating a particular sequence with an organism. In similarity-based <b>binning,</b> methods such as BLAST are used to rapidly search for phylogenetic markers or otherwise similar sequences in existing public databases. This approach is implemented in MEGAN. Another tool, PhymmBL, uses interpolated Markov models to assign reads. [...] and AMPHORA are methods based on unique clade-specific markers for estimating organismal relative abundances with improved computational performances. Recent methods, such as , use read coverage landscape of individual reference genomes to minimize false-positive hits and get reliable relative abundances. [...] In composition based <b>binning,</b> methods use intrinsic features of the sequence, such as oligonucleotide frequencies or codon usage bias. Once sequences are binned, it is possible to carry out comparative analysis of diversity and richness.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{standalone}} tools for analysing high-throughput metagenome shotgun data was MEGAN (MEta Genome ANalyzer). A first version {{of the program was}} used in 2005 to analyse the metagenomic context of DNA sequences obtained from a mammoth bone. Based on a BLAST comparison against a reference database, this tool performs both taxonomic and functional <b>binning,</b> by placing the reads onto the nodes of the NCBI taxonomy using a simple lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm or onto the nodes of the [...] or KEGG classifications, respectively.|$|E
