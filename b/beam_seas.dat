Two days after the vessel's departure for Fremantle, on 30 January 1909, Mr Taylor mysteriously disappeared without trace. In the interim, he had been observed to be behaving in a peculiar and eccentric manner. He had also informed other passengers that he had been in South Africa for some years, and had lost a lot of money. It was therefore assumed that [...] "his losses had preyed upon his mind", and that [...] "in a fit of melancholia", he had [...] "jumped overboard in the night." [...] Meanwhile, fine weather prevailed down to the 28th parallel. On 5 February 1909, Koombana passed Amsterdam Island. From there to Fremantle, she encountered strong southerly winds and heavy <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} numerical {{method that}} couples a seakeeping solver {{based on the}} potential flow theory and a Navier-Stokes (NS) solver with the volume of fluid (VOF) model was developed to study the behaviour of a damaged ship in <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b> The dynamics of water flooding and sloshing in the compartments were calculated by the NS solver, whereas the hydrodynamic forces induced by the sea waves on the external hull surface were calculated using the seakeeping solver. At each time step, the instantaneous ship motion {{was applied to the}} excitation of the internal water motion; the corresponding load inside the compartments was added to the resultant external force, which was used to update the ship's motion. To assess its performance, the integrated method was used to simulate the roll decay of a damaged Ro-Ro ferry and the ferry's motion in regular <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b> Validation against experimental data showed that the proposed method can yield satisfactory results with acceptable computational costs...|$|E

The source points are distributed over the mean wetted body surface {{as well as}} on the free surface. The shallow water effect has been taken into consideration. Moreover, the influence of the distance between the vessels is also investigated. To verify the present code, two Wigley III hulls are simulated both in <b>beam</b> <b>sea</b> and head sea conditions. The wave pattern and the motion RAOs of 6 -DOF are calculated by present code and compared with WADAM program which is based on Green function method. From the comparisons, good agreement is found between present calculation and Wadam results.

40|$|After {{determining}} a need {{to further}} investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of the side-by-side floating bodies at a close proximity, model scale experiments were conducted. This experiment changed parameters such as the gap width and wave heading {{to examine the effects}} of hydrodynamic interaction. Two initial gap widths, 300 and 450 mm, and four wave headings, 90 ⁰, 60 ⁰, 30 ⁰ and 0 ⁰, were examined. Each experimental setup was examined over a range of wave frequencies, while free surface elevation and vessel motion responses were monitored and recorded. Analysis of the data showed the narrow gap resonance phenomena. However, the experiment did show little variation of the frequency where gap resonance occurred. <b>Beam</b> <b>seas</b> cases showed one peak frequency where values were significantly amplified compared to surrounding frequencies, while other wave headings showed two peak frequencies. There was little variation of the frequency where resonance occurred for each case. However, the magnitude of amplification did show significant variation over each case.

40|$|In this paper, the {{stability}} of a ship with stabilizing tanks (U-tanks) in a longitudinal seaway is investigated. The effectiveness of properly adjusted tanks in <b>beam</b> <b>sea</b> is known. Their effect is to split the ordinary resonance peak in two other shifted in frequency. Its is possible to choose a value for the damping in the tanks so that the two peaks coalesce into one that is significantly reduced {{with respect to the}} situation without tanks. Here, we extend the analysis by taking into account the very dangerous parametric rolling in a longitudinal sea. To this end, the system of equations describing ship rolling, water motion in the tank and heave motion was considered. An approximate solution, obtained with the multiscale perturbation method allowed to obtain an expression for the threshold of parametric rolling.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating the spectra of water wave disturbances on {{five of the six}} axes of a stationary, slender body underwater vehicle in an inertia dominated wave force regime, both in head seas and in <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b> Inertia dominated wave forces are typical of those encountered by a 21 inch diameter, torpedo shaped underwater vehicle operating in coastal waters and sea state 2. Strip theory is used to develop transfer function phase and magnitude between surface water waves and the slender body pitch, heave, and surge forces and moment for the vehicle in head seas, and for pitch, heave, yaw, and sway forces and moments in <b>beam</b> <b>seas.</b> Experiments are conducted which verify this method of transfer function calculation, and demonstrate the effects of vehicle forward motion in the head seas case. Using known sea spectra and linear time invariant systems theory allows for estimation of the water wave disturbance spectra for these forces and moments. Application of sliding control techniques are then developed for the underwater vehicle longitudinal plane equations of motion. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the dependence of underwater vehicle depth control upon the pitch control, and adaptive pitch control is shown to provide good performance in the presence of substantial parametric uncertainty. Pitch disturbance rejection properties of variations of the sliding controller are investigated. Both single frequency and stochastic disturbances are used, and the stochastic disturbance is developed using the results of the earlier investigation. [URL]...|$|E

On the other hand, the stochastic averaging method leads to a dimension reduction of the original system, but the essential behavior is retained. Then numerical solution or even analytical solution of the low-dimensional FP equation can be obtained. Since {{the principles of the}} above two stochastic methods are different, a comparative study is valuable and noticeable.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} forward-speed seakeeping {{theory is}} {{proposed by the}} inclusion of a tank sloshing flow model. The methodology is based on a coupling model of sloshing and seakeeping in the frequency domain.

The classical expression for restoring forces is accordingly modified for the coupled analysis. The global motion responses of a modern LNG carrier at forward speed in <b>beam</b> <b>seas</b> are then calculated to investigate the coupling effects between sloshing and seakeeping. No prominent coupling effect was observed in heave and pitch motions while a significant effect was observed in sway and roll motions.

A computer program has been developed to calculate ship motions of the craft. The accuracy of this computer program is checked by measurement of ship motions in waves. Furthermore, results of the calculation are in good agreement with the measured ones.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between {{the dynamics of the}} floodwater and the damaged ship in waves is investigated by applying an integrated method, which couples a seakeeping solver and a Navier-Stokes solver.

It is found that the shift of the natural roll frequency of a damaged ship and the decrease of its roll response are mainly due to the water sloshing inside the compartment. The effect of the resonant sloshing leads to the presence of a ship's second peak response at higher frequencies and it is significantly reduced by the water flooding through the damaged opening. The influence of the flooding and the sloshing on the ship behaviour is small with a further increase of the wave frequency...|$|E
