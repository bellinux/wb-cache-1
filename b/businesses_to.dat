While many studies have investigated the antecedents and effects of commitment on <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>business</b> relationships, the impact of price satisfaction on suppliers' commitment has not been investigated. As a result, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the effect that price satisfaction has on suppliers' commitment in a <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>business</b> relationship utilising the Australian wine industry as a context. The results of the study show that price reliability and relative prices have a strong affect on suppliers' commitment and these aspects of price satisfaction should be heeded by buyers of <b>business</b> <b>to</b> <b>business</b> goods and services...|$|R
5|$|The British {{government}} and Welsh employment bodies funded and subsidized external <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> locate new ventures within the valleys {{to replace the}} vanishing heavy industries. The first attempt to bring in business not connected to the coal mining industry began in the 1920s when David Jones, Town Clerk to the Rhondda Urban Council, gained government support in attracting outside <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> the area. Companies included Alfred Polikoff's clothing factory, Messers Jacob Beatus, manufacturing cardboard boxes and Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd. Following {{the end of the}} Second World War, 23 companies were set up in the Rhondda Valleys, eighteen of them sponsored by the Board of Trade. Most companies had periods of growth and collapse, notably Thorn EMI in the 1970s and Burberry in the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media.

5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E

5|$|A {{separate}} {{criminal investigation}} {{focused on the}} illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and do not follow building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against {{the owners of the}} factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges.

5|$|Air Norway {{was founded}} in 2003 by Gunnar Hagsveen. Scheduled {{services}} from Ørland to Oslo commenced on 23 May 2003. The company had originally planned to also operate aircraft between Ørland and Bodø Airport, to two main air stations of the Norwegian Air Force, but these plans were abandoned. Just after the route commenced, the owner became seriously ill, and marketing and sales efforts were neglected, causing a less-than-predicted cabin load. Hagsveen died on 26 December, and his heirs encouraged local <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> purchase shares in the company. Air Norway commenced weekly flights from Oslo to Aalborg Airport in Denmark from 31 January 2004.

5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding copper-nickel cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to fill the void left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000–8,000 varieties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal <b>businesses,</b> <b>to</b> blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted that at one point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E

Mitsubishi decided to target sales to corporate customers in Japan at first to allow local governments and <b>businesses</b> <b>to</b> set up recharging stations around the country. The company said initial sales were constrained by production capacity but expects production to ramp up quickly from 2,000 units in 2009/10 to 30,000 vehicles within three years as it expands {{production of}} lithium-ion battery through Lithium Energy Japan, {{a joint venture with}} GS Yuasa Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation.
