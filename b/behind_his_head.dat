5|$|If I Be Lifted Up– Christ {{is portrayed}} in the clouds, with light {{radiating}} from <b>behind</b> <b>His</b> <b>head</b> as the penetrating eyes seem to follow the viewer around the nave. An extra layer of mottled glass behind the clouds was used by Tiffany.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July, Johnson {{shared in}} the {{destruction}} of another Bf 109 with Pilot Officer Hepple. Johnson's wingman disappeared during the battle. Sergeant Mabbet was mortally wounded but made a wheels-up landing near St Omer. Impressed with his skilful flying while badly wounded, the Germans buried him with full honours. On 23 July, Johnson damaged another Bf 109. During this battle Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 26 was wounded; his life was saved by a recently installed armour plate <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as {{he carries}} his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands are}} blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E
60|$|His {{appearance}} {{was far from}} reassuring. His hands were clasped <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent forward, and he surveyed her with a most malignant expression upon his face.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The top fighter wraps an arm <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>head</b> {{and grabs}} <b>his</b> own sleeve to {{complete}} the choke.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} gasp she uttered before I {{caught sight of}} her. She was seated at the table's head in her great wooden chair, and Fra Gervasio was pacing the rush-strewn floor in talk with her, <b>his</b> hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrust forward.|$|R
5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it appears}} that Fox is {{actually}} playing a guitar, music supervisor Bones Howe hired Hollywood guitar coach and musician Paul Hanson to teach Fox to simulate playing all the parts so it would look realistic, including playing <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Fox lip-synched [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] to vocals by Mark Campbell (of Jack Mack and the Heart Attack fame), with the guitar solo played by Tim May.|$|E
500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E
60|$|But the Lord of Stoutenburg is more wakeful than all. Like a caged {{beast of}} prey he paces {{up and down}} the low, narrow weighing-room of the molens, his hands tightly clenched <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bare, <b>his</b> cloak cast aside despite the bitter coldness of the night.|$|R
60|$|Within the schoolmaster's study he whom Duhamel called Maximilien {{strode to}} and fro, <b>his</b> hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent, <b>his</b> chin thrust forward, denouncing the seigneurial system, of whose atrocity he had {{received}} that evening instances enough--for {{he had heard the}} whole story of La Boulaye's rebellion against the power of Bellecour and the causes that had led to it.|$|R
50|$|The {{manner in}} which Cottle is accidentally killed (Don Andrea is pushed by a barging door from <b>behind,</b> causing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to hit Cottle's bum, causing Cottle {{to fall out of}} a balcony).|$|R
2500|$|A {{partially}} obscured V sign can {{be added}} to someone else's head to produce devil's horns or [...] "bunny ears" [...] for an amusing photo. In September 2013, Manu Tuilagi apologised to Prime Minister David Cameron after making a [...] "bunny ears" [...] sign <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in a photo taken during a visit by the British and Irish Lions squad to Downing Street.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch had a career-long 79-yard {{touchdown}} run against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 16, similar to his [...] "Beast Quake" [...] 67-yard scoring {{run in the}} 2011 Wild Card game against the New Orleans Saints. Four days later, Lynch was fined $11,050 by the NFL for his celebration of the score; falling back while extending the ball <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and grabbing his crotch. The league considered his celebration an [...] "obscene gesture" [...] to constitute unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, MTV was in {{its early}} years. They were {{traveling}} to several colleges. MTV made a stop in Marquette, MI. It was there that Mike Pearson {{and a group of}} college friends from State University of New Paltz were dancing in front of the MTV Team. Mike began to dance with one hand <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and one hand extended out straight. They asked Mike, [...] "what do you call that dance?", Mike replied, [...] "I'll call it the sprinkler!". And that day in 1987, the sprinkler dance was born.|$|E
6000|$|His gaze {{turned at}} once but slowly from J. J. O'Molloy's towards Stephen's face and then bent {{at once to}} the ground, seeking. His {{unglazed}} linen collar appeared <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> bent <b>head,</b> soiled by <b>his</b> withering hair. Still seeking, he said: ...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Detective Nick Vera (Ratchford), having {{viewed the}} {{exchange}} <b>behind</b> glass, shakes <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and quips, [...] "Didn't see that coming." ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Ruff's {{expression}} never changed. There {{was nothing}} about him, {{as he stood}} there with <b>his</b> hands <b>behind</b> him, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown a little forward, in the least inspiring--nothing calculated to terrify the most timid person. Yet the girl {{looked at him with}} the eyes of a frightened bird.|$|R
60|$|He {{sank back}} on the window-seat and clasped his hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|He blundered {{into the}} living-room, {{lay on the}} davenport, hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sabatini seated himself comfortably {{at the end}} of {{the sofa}} and placed a cushion <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now Tubbs was by {{no means}} a good swimmer, and the idea of being thrown into the water with <b>his</b> hands tied <b>behind</b> him and <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in a sack was frightful in the extreme.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, you should," [...] she {{interrupted}} him, {{and pushed}} past {{him up the}} stairs. At the drawing-room door she paused--he was unaware of her presence. And he had not changed! She wondered why she had expected him to change. Even the glow of his newly acquired fame was not discernible <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> well-remembered <b>head.</b> He seemed no older--and no younger. And he was standing with <b>his</b> hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back gazing in simple, silent appreciation at the big tapestry nearest the windows.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not seem}} nervous, however. With hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back and <b>head</b> bowed, he leisurely paced {{the path to the}} bridge, without {{hesitation}} crossed the river and proceeded along the road in a direction opposite to the village.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you took}} my advice, Monsieur," [...] he remarked, helping {{himself to a}} cushion from another chair, and placing it <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Walter Upton {{pushed aside}} books and papers, yawned, stretched, yawned again, then settled {{back in his}} chair comfortably, his hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|And the Colonel, to emphasise his words, flung {{himself into}} the {{appropriate}} attitude, throwing his left hand up <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and lunging fiercely with the right.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Christ in Gethsemane" by Liska, depicting Christ on his knees in prayer, [s. d. ]. Christ is shown kneeling in the dust, his elbows resting on a ledge of rock in front of him. His forearms fold back from the elbow to rest his clasped hands on <b>his</b> shoulder, just <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> haloed <b>head.</b> Sparse vegetation {{can be seen in}} the rest of the rocky terrain...|$|R
60|$|He {{had raised}} himself wholly upright on the couch, his massive figure, in the {{gorgeous}} crimson tunic, standing out clear and trenchant against the shadowy whiteness of the marble walls <b>behind</b> him. <b>His</b> <b>head,</b> with the ruddy mass of hair {{on which the}} flickering lamps threw brilliant, golden lights, was thrown back, and the eyes, deep, intent, and glowing with unrevealed ardour, looked straight out before him into the shadows.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} {{animal rights activists}} break into the {{laboratory}} to rescue the animals. Kieron is left <b>behind,</b> having <b>his</b> <b>head</b> removed {{from the rest of}} his body and being kept alive by machines. As the other animals are boarded into the activists' truck they don't know what's going on, and are joined by Niall (voiced by Arthur Mathews), a rabbit from an earlier batch of Project S which can only speak computer advice.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} call bad news?" [...] asked Lee, {{clasping}} his hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and leaning back on the sofa, but without withdrawing his eyes from her face.|$|E
60|$|Late one night, {{when the}} weary {{carriers}} lay camped {{for a brief}} rest in thick forest, Maxwell beckoned Amadu. He lay in the slung hammock, a lantern burning <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|His {{awakening}} was a rude one. He {{felt himself}} raised up, a large towel was passed {{over his face}} and tied <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and then he was}} dragged from his cot.|$|E
60|$|Mechanically she {{followed}} Chauvelin {{down the corridor}} and along the passages which she had traversed a brief half-hour ago. From some distant church tower a clock tolled the hour of ten. It had then really only been little more than thirty brief minutes since first she had entered this grim building, which seemed less stony than the monsters who held authority within it; to her it seemed that centuries had gone over her head during that time. She felt like an old woman, unable to straighten her back or to steady her limbs; she could only dimly see some few paces ahead the trim figure of Chauvelin walking with measured steps, <b>his</b> hands held <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown up {{with what looked like}} triumphant defiance.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} Rose Street {{he saw no}} boy {{near the}} bridge, {{and was about to}} ask his guide if the alleged owner of the box had not gone to some other portion of the city, when he was suddenly seized from <b>behind,</b> and, turning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly, he saw Skip's face.|$|R
60|$|I first {{caught sight}} of my uncle when we were still some yards away {{in one of the}} flying glimpses of {{twilight}} that chequered the pitch darkness of the night. He was standing up <b>behind</b> the parapet, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown back and the bottle to his mouth. As he put it down, he saw and recognised us with a toss of one hand fleeringly above <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
