50|$|<b>Bemotrizinol</b> (INN/USAN, INCI bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine) is an {{oil-soluble}} {{organic compound}} that {{is added to}} sunscreens to absorb UV rays. It is marketed as Tinosorb S by BASF and as Escalol S by Ashland Inc. A recent development is Tinosorb S Aqua, which is <b>bemotrizinol</b> in a PMMA matrix dispersed in water. This {{makes it possible to}} add <b>bemotrizinol</b> to the water phase.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bemotrizinol</b> is not {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration, but is approved in the European Union since the year 2000 {{and other parts of}} the world, including Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bemotrizinol</b> {{has strong}} {{synergistic}} {{effects on the}} SPF when formulated with bisoctrizole, ethylhexyl triazone or iscotrizinol. It {{is the most effective}} UV absorber available measured by SPF, based on the maximum concentration permitted by European legislation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bemotrizinol</b> is a broad-spectrum UV absorber, {{absorbing}} UVB {{as well as}} UVA rays. It has two absorption peaks, 310 and 340 nm. It {{is highly}} photostable. Even after 50 MEDs (minimal erythemal doses), 98.4% remains intact. It helps prevent the photodegradation of other sunscreen actives like avobenzone.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{active ingredients}} in sunscreens are usually aromatic molecules conjugated with carbonyl groups. This general structure allows the molecule to absorb high-energy ultraviolet rays and release the energy as lower-energy rays, thereby preventing the skin-damaging ultraviolet rays {{from reaching the}} skin. So, upon exposure to UV light, most of the ingredients (with the notable exception of avobenzone) do not undergo significant chemical change, allowing these ingredients to retain the UV-absorbing potency without significant photodegradation. A chemical stabilizer is included in some sunscreens containing avobenzone to slow its breakdown; examples include formulations containing Helioplex and AvoTriplex. The stability of avobenzone can also be improved by <b>bemotrizinol,</b> octocrylene and various other photostabilisers. Most organic compounds in sunscreens slowly degrade and become less effective {{over the course of}} several years if stored properly, resulting in the expiration dates calculated for the product.|$|E
