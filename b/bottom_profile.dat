The hull was to be lengthened a full three meters: four feet (1.2 m) at the front and six feet (1.8 m) at the back. This way it should be able to cross a trench 18 feet (5.5 m) wide. To ensure that the tank could turn at all, despite its critically high length-width ratio, the <b>bottom</b> <b>profile</b> of the tracks would be more strongly curved, so that a smaller part of the track would touch the ground.

5000|$|Wheels are of {{the normal}} road racing type fitted with knobby tires (a variety of tread designs in both tubular and {{clincher}} types are available), although deeper rim profiles may be preferred for their advantages in thick mud. There are slight geometry differences between road and cyclocross bicycles; cyclo-cross bikes tend to have slightly higher handlebars for a more upright position as aerodynamics have little importance in a cross race. A second set of brake levers on the tops, called [...] "top mount" [...] or [...] "interrupter" [...] brake levers, are favored by some competitors. The top tubes of cyclocross bike frames typically have an ovalized or flattened <b>bottom</b> <b>profile</b> to provide greater comfort when riders need to shoulder and carry their bikes. In general, with a change of tires and gearing a cyclo-cross bike can double as a perfectly adequate road racing machine. However, most cyclo-cross racers prefer clipless mountain bike pedals for their easy dual-sided entry and mud-shedding abilities. Additionally, mountain biking shoes provide better traction while running than typical road style shoes thanks to flexibility in the sole and pronounced tread patterns.|$|E

50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the <b>bottom</b> <b>profile</b> was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and flat wire ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|E

40|$|For well-mixed estuaries, key {{physical}} {{mechanisms are}} identified and quantified that cause changes in {{characteristics of the}} semi-diurnal sea surface elevation and lateral velocity due to modifications of the lateral <b>bottom</b> <b>profile,</b> channel deepening, and sea level rise. This is done by decomposing solutions of a new analytical model into components relating to different physical processes. The default geometry and parameter values are representative for the Ems estuary, with a converging width and a reflective landward boundary. The default Gaussian lateral <b>bottom</b> <b>profile</b> is modified to obtain profiles with the same cross-sectional area, but with a different skewness or steepness. Results show that a steeper lateral <b>bottom</b> <b>profile</b> leads to amplification of the sea surface elevation. The width convergence is shown to influence the resonance characteristics. Channel deepening and sea level rise result in amplification of the sea surface elevation until a resonance peak is reached. When flooding is incorporated, the amount of sea level rise at which maximum tidal amplification occurs {{is found to be}} about two times lower. When using a symmetric Gaussian <b>bottom</b> <b>profile,</b> the lateral tidal flow is determined by Coriolis deflection of longitudinal flow and lateral density gradients caused by differential salt advection. However, an additional lateral tidal flow component incorporating the effect of continuity related to sea level variations and longitudinal gradients in longitudinal flow is shown to become increasingly important for skewed lateral bottom profiles. Furthermore, the lateral flow due to the lateral density gradient is enhanced for bottom profiles with increased steepness...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of very long waves {{propagating}} {{on the surface of}} water.

In our model, dispersion does not affect the evolution of the wave even over the large distances that tsunamis may travel. We allow a distribution of vorticity, in addition to variable depth. Our solution is not valid for depth = O(epsilon(4 / 5)); the equations here are expressed in terms of the single parameter epsilon(2 / 5) sigma and matched to the solution in deep water. For a slow depth variation of the background state (consistent with our model), we prove that a constant-vorticity solution exists, from deep water to shoreline, and that regions of isolated vorticity can also exist, for appropriate <b>bottom</b> <b>profiles.</b> We describe how the wave properties are modified by the presence of vorticity.
