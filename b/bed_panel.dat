5000|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Chevrolet Avalanche, {{customers}} began to notice cosmetic problems with the cladding on their vehicles. Over time exposure to heat and sunlight would cause a chalky faded appearance. It was especially noticeable on the cargo <b>bed</b> <b>panels,</b> and sail-panel windows where [...] "Zebra Striping" [...] would appear. Customer reaction to this problem resulted in General Motors agreeing to a one time treatment of a product called ArmorDillo. This product would temporarily restore the cladding for a period of about 6 months. After that it would wear off then need to be re-applied. Realizing this was not a permanent solution, GM, together with Gatorback Coatings, developed a coating that could be applied to the cladding to restore it to a like-new shine. This product was designed to etch into the plastic and bond a new layer of tinted acrylic over the faded plastic. Customers within the 3yr/36,000 original factory warranty could go to their dealership to have it restored under their original warranty under GM TSB:04-08-111-001C. GM did not use side body cladding on the second generation model. General Motors has also identified the original source of the faded cladding.|$|R

40|$|Particulate matter removal at high {{temperatures}} {{has gained a}} great attention {{in the last years}} due to the vast growing of power production plants around the world. A reliable and robust gas cleaning method is inherently necessary to facilitate efficient fuel to energy conversion while protecting all the downstream equipments in a plant. In accordance with the current demand, a detail study has been conducted on <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> filter which exhibits the suitable characteristic for high temperature applications. The thesis focuses on four main parts related to the  design evaluation, experimental verification and development of new apparatus and method for regeneration  in a <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> filter. The four main parts are as following; 1. Testing of an advanced new louver design, “ filter tray ” at room and elevated temperature 2. Development of a new apparatus and method  for puff-back cleaning 3. Testing of “filter tray” with the new puff-back apparatus and 4. Industrial scale <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> filter testing in a commercial combustion plant. A very first laboratory scale <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> filter with filter tray louvers was built and tested at room temperature. Tests were performed mainly at higher filtration velocities (7 – 31 cm/s) with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 710 m) as filtration medium with standardized test dust (mean diameter of 9 m). The filter demonstrated excellent results at filtration velocity of 30 cm/s however unstable residual pressure drop profile and high dust penetration were recorded, suggesting the depth of the granular beds are too shallow. A second laboratory scale panel-bed filter with filter tray louvers with deeper granular beds, i. e. 40 mm was built. The gas-entry surfaces are much larger than the first test rig. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 & 710 m) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 & 9 m) as test dust at room temperature and at 120 °C. The filter illustrated excellent results however failure in the conventional puff-back method to supply sufficient sharp pressure pulse led to improper removal of filter cake. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} an improved means of supplying puff-back gas to the tall wide <b>panel</b> <b>beds.</b> A novel high speed valve, a new method and apparatus for creating a longitudinally disposed sharp puff of gas for renewal of gas-entry surfaces was built and tested independently. The quick opening valve consists of a standard cylinder with air outlet holes, a rod with nylon plugs and an actuator. The valve was built in the laboratory; several adjustments were made along the test until the time for emptying of the pressure in the tank was less than 50 ms. It was then integrated with the second test rig, referred to as third  test rig. Tests were performed at room temperature with the aid of high-speed camera to obtain visualization of the movement of the granular beds during puff-back with and without the presence of filter cake. Filtration test were performed at elevated temperature of 120 °C. Tests were performed from low to high filtration velocities with sintered bauxite spherical particles (mean diameter of 470 µm) and olivine sand particles (mean diameter of 545 m) as filtration medium and standardized test dust (mean diameter of 4 m). The results and video file analysis revealed that the new puff-back method is capable of removing the entire filter cake, resulting in stable residual pressure profile and very low dust penetration compared to the conventional puff-back. An industrial scale <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> filter testing is the fourth test rig. The field test was performed with a single filter module of louver design L 10 - 56 at a 450 -kW biomass combustion plant at Bjertnæs Sag AS in Jevnaker in Norway. The test was performed with a slip stream from the main stream of exhaust gas before emitting to the chimney. The test was performed at superficial velocity between 5. 4 - 6. 9 cm/s with total flow rate of 290 - 370 m 3 /h at 120 °C with inlet dust concentration between 1. 4 to 1. 8 g/m 3. Olivine sand particles with mean diameter of 545 m were used as filtration medium. The results showed filter cakes are being formed on the gas-entry surfaces and the penetration was lower than the allowed limit during the beginning of the test. Nonetheless, due to some instability caused probably by some slight variation in the louver geometry led to higher emission towards the end of the test and hence further testing was interrupted.

A train of flatcars, half loaded with LGV sleepers, arrives at the site. It is pushed by a special diesel locomotive, which is low enough to fit underneath the gantry cranes. The cranes remove the panels of temporary track, and stack them onto the empty half of the sleeper train. Next, they pick up sets of 30 LGV sleepers, pre-arranged with the proper spacing (60 cm, or 24 in), using a special fixture.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that gas-phase byproducts of incomplete oxidation were generated when a prototype ultraviolet photocatalytic oxidation (UVPCO) air cleaner was operated {{in the laboratory}} with indoor-relevant mixtures of VOCs at realistic concentrations. Under these conditions, there was net production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, two important indoor air toxicants. Here, we further explore the issue of byproduct generation. Using the same UVPCO air cleaner, we conducted experiments to identify common VOCs {{that lead to the}} production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde and to quantify their production rates. We sought to reduce the production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to acceptable levels by employing different chemisorbent scrubbers downstream of the UVPCO device. Additionally, we made preliminary measurements to estimate the capacity and expected lifetime of the chemisorbent media. For most experiments, the system was operated at 680 - 780 m{sup 3 }/h (400 - 460 cfm). A set of experiments was conducted with common VOCs introduced into the UVPCO device individually and in mixture. Compound conversion efficiencies and the production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were determined by comparison of compound concentrations upstream and downstream of the reactor. There was general agreement between compound conversions efficiencies determined individually and in the mixture. This suggests that competition among compounds for active sites on the photocatalyst surface will not limit the performance of the UVPCO device when the total VOC concentration is low. A possible exception was the very volatile alcohols, for which there were some indications of competitive adsorption. The results also showed that formaldehyde was produced from many commonly encountered VOCs, while acetaldehyde was generated by specific VOCs, particularly ethanol. The implication is that formaldehyde concentrations are likely to increase when an effective UVPCO air cleaner is used in buildings containing typical VOC sources. The magnitude of the expected increase will depend upon a number of interrelated factors. Series of experiments were conducted to determine if the oxidizer, sodium permanganate (NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O), has sufficient reaction rates and capacity to counteract formaldehyde and acetaldehyde production and enable a 50 % reduction in building ventilation rate without net increases in indoor aldehyde concentrations. A commercially produced filter element and two laboratory-fabricated media beds containing NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O chemisorbent media were evaluated. The effectiveness of a device for removal of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and other VOCs was determined by measurement of concentrations immediately upstream and downstream of the device. In some experiments, conversion efficiencies and byproduct generation by the UVPCO device also were determined. Six experiments were conducted with the commercial filter element installed downstream of the UVPCO reactor. Eleven experiments were conducted with a single <b>panel</b> media <b>bed</b> (30 cm by 61 cm by 2. 5 cm deep) installed downstream of the UVPCO reactor; in these, the effects of temperature and air residence time on conversion efficiency were examined. Two experiments were conducted with a four-panel, folded, media bed (approximately four {{times the size of the}} single <b>panel</b> <b>bed)</b> installed downstream of the reactor. Because the commercial unit contained activated carbon as an additional component, it was effective at removing lower volatility compounds that typically have low oxidation rates in the UVPCO reactor. The filter element also met the minimum efficiency objective for formaldehyde. However, the removal of acetaldehyde was less than required. The air residence time in the single <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> was not optimized as the removal efficiencies for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were strongly inversely related to the air flow rate through the device. In addition, the acetaldehyde removal efficiency decreased to less than 10 % with extended use of the device. The folded bed was considerably more effective; formaldehyde was removed with greater than 90 % efficiency, and acetaldehyde was removed at about 70 % efficiency. With the combined UVPCO/chemisorbent system, the net removal efficiencies for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were 90 % and 40 %, respectively. In summary, the use of a multi-panel, folded scrubber filled with NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O chemisorbent media downstream of the prototype UVPCO air cleaner effectively counteracted the generation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde due to incomplete oxidation of VOCs in the UVPCO reactor. Thus, this combined UVPCO air cleaner and chemisorbent system appears to have sufficient VOC removal efficiency to enable a 50 % reduction in ventilation rate without increasing indoor aldehyde concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>bed</b> filter (PBF) is a {{granular}} filter patented by A. M. Squires {{in the late}} sixties. PBFs consist of louvers with stationary, granular beds. Dust is deposited in the top layers and on the bed surface when gas flows through. PBFs are resistant to high temperatures, variations in the gas flow and hot particles. The filter is cleaned by releasing a pressure pulse {{in the opposite direction}} of the bulk flow (a puff back pulse). A new louver geometry patented by A. M. Squires is the filter tray louvers. The new design is believed to reduce the pressure drop and the number of louvers, and to make the filter more compact. We have designed and built a laboratory scale PBF with filter tray louvers based on the patent. Experiments with the prototype show that the new louver can be cleaned with a puff back pulse. A PBF system for a hypothetical biomass combustion plant has been designed. The heat from the flue gas will be used for district heating. The proposed PBF system design consists of double-sided modules with 46 filter tray louvers on top of each other. Five modules are mounted together in module columns, sharing the same clean gas duct and puff back pipe. The granular medium chosen is Sintered Bauxite 20 / 40 (SB). The module columns are placed in an enveloping house. SB and dust fall into bins {{in the bottom of the}} enveloping house during puff back cleaning. A vacuum pneumatic conveying system brings the dust and SB to the top of the filter. Dust and SB are separated in a sieve. Dust is deposited, and SB is transported back to the modules. NTNU is currently involved in the BioSOFC project. The objective of this project is to increase efficiency in energy production from biomass by using producer gas from a biomass gasification plant in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. Field tests will be performed at a plant in Güssing, Austria. A PBF will be used for gas filtration. The operating temperature will be 500 °C to avoid tar condensation. We have performed heating experiments on the BioSOFC filter system. The results were not satisfactory, as the temperature in the filter ranged from 384 to 625 °C. The filter system was due to be shipped, and new tests could not be performed. This work proposes that modifications to the heating cable circuits are made, and new heating tests are performed before the field testing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{increasing}} demand for forest products and restricted {{use of natural}} forests {{has resulted in a}} shortage of high-strength wood fiber. The area covered by plantation forests is steadily rising, but the fiber produced by these forests is often unsuitable for high-strength applications. One attempt to combat this problem is the Viscoelastic Thermal Compression (VTC) process, which can dramatically increase the strength and stiffness of any wood species. In order to advance VTC wood from the concept evaluation stage to the development stage, concept testing interviews were conducted with individuals in the forest products industry and with design professionals (i. e. architects, engineers, contractors, etc.). Valuable opinions, ideas, and insights were gathered from interviewees concerning potential applications for VTC wood, as well as advantages and barriers to its commercialization. Overall, forest products interviewees thought the most viable uses for VTC wood were LVL, plywood, concrete forms, transportation components, and flooring. The most frequently mentioned advantages to commercialization included increased mechanical properties and the utilization of a low-value wood species; barriers to commercialization were cost and the forest products industry’s resistance to change. Forest products interviewees thought VTC wood would be successful {{as long as it was}} not markedly more expensive than similar products. Design professionals thought the properties of VTC wood are best suited for use in glulam beams, flooring, cabinetry, and LVL. The most commonly mentioned advantages to commercialization included increased mechanical properties, the ability to achieve greater spans, and the color darkening that occurs during production; barriers to commercialization included cost, energy use during production, and unfamiliarity. Overall, interviewees seemed to think VTC wood could be successfully commercialized if it is cost-competitive, energy-efficient, and tested extensively on a large scale. As a whole, the interviewees believed that VTC wood has the most potential being successfully commercialized as a component of LVL, flooring, and/or glulam beams. These three products were likely mentioned with the highest frequency because radical changes in production would not need to occur in order to integrate VTC wood. One (or more) of these three products would be a logical starting point for VTC wood to enter the market. LVL and glulam beams have the potential to gain market share from steel, which could be used as a selling point. Flooring, on the other hand, cannot be used structurally, but may garner higher profits than LVL and glulam beams. Unique product ideas that may warrant additional investigation in the future are components for car/truck/train/boat interiors, commercial truck/trailer <b>beds,</b> retrofitting, SIP <b>panels,</b> benches, specialty pallets/crating, furniture, and export products. While interesting, these types of products may not be worth exploring until VTC wood is proven in more conventional products, such as LVL or glulam beams. However, they should not be ignored due to their potential for higher financial returns...|$|R
40|$|Impaired venous {{drainage}} of {{the lower}} extremities, mainly due to venous reflux or to venous outflow obstruction, leads to a cascade of pathological events clinically graded by the clinical class (C) of the CEAP classification (Clinical, aEtiological, Anatomical, Pathophysiological) of chronic venous disease (CVD). Varicose veins are the most frequent clinical sign in class C 2. When oedema complicates varicose veins, the clinical picture is graded as C 3. Pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis and other skin changes are classified as C 4. A small but significant number of the affected patients develop venous ulcers. Healed ulcers are classified as C 5, whereas active ulcers are C 6. Altered venous haemodynamics are a necessary but not exclusive element for explaining progression along the clinical classes {{to the point of}} skin lesion. In 1982, Browse and Burnand observed a peri-capillary fibrin deposition and speculated that cuffs act as a barrier to oxygen diffusion and nutrients, resulting in epidermal cell death. This mechanism of tissue injury has not yet been demonstrated. The fibrin cuff may be more properly considered a scaffold for tissue reparative processes. The cuff contains fibrin, but also laminin, fibronectin, tenascin, and types I and III collagen, encircling the dilated capillary vein The decline of the fibrin cuff theory over the last twenty years has led to investigation of other factors emphasizing inflammatory mechanisms as amplifiers of the insufficient venous drainage. Recent studies demonstrate a pivotal role for tissue iron accumulation in inducing and maintaining inflammation in CVD. Iron deposits in CVD cause readily visible brownish dermal areas which sometimes precede, but always surround, ulcers. The origin of increased leg iron stores is extravasation of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in conditions of significant venous stasis. Erythrocytes are degraded by the interstitial macrophages, with the released iron incorporated into ferritin. Over time, with increasing overload of iron, the structure of ferritin changes to haemosiderin. In 1988, Ackermann found a twenty-fold higher average concentration of iron in lower limbs affected by venous ulcers as compared to the upper arm of the same subjects. The phenomenon of leg haemosiderin deposits seems to be significant for the entire body, since this protein has been demonstrated in the urine of patients affected by CVD. Increased iron stores and interstitial protein extravasa- tion are potent chemo-attractants and presumably represent the initial underlying chronic inflammatory signal respon- sible for white blood-cells recruitment and migration in the matrix (Figure 2 B). In 1988, Coleridge-Smith observed leukocytes trapped in the venous microcirculation second- ary to venous hypertension. This work paved the way to the investigation of the relationship between CVD and inflammation. The mechanism of white cell migration in the subcutaneous matrix was further elucidated by studies of the expression of adhesion molecules in a model of venous hypertension. Several studies confirmed the expression of these molecules, including ICAM, VCAM and selectins. Such adhesion molecules block circulating white cells on the vein wall and facilitate transmigration into the tissue. The predominant cells migrating into the extra-cellular matrix are macrophages and T-lymphocytes. Macrophages take up iron accumulated in the tissue and store it in intracellular ferritin-like structures (Figure 3 B). Intra- and extra-cellular overload of iron in the tissue could potentially be dangerous for generation of free radicals due to possible release of free iron from deposits. Wenk et al. and Yeoh-Ellerton found increased iron levels in Panel A, classic fibrin cuffs (arrow) thicken veins (v) in a venous ulcer <b>bed,</b> 40 X. <b>Panel</b> B, fibrin cuffs (arrow) encircles proliferated thick walled veins (v) in a peri-ventricular MS plaque, exudates from chronic leg ulcers as compared to acute wounds. They also observed significant concentrations of metabolites from oxidative stress. The final step of the pathogenetic chain leading to matrix disruption and ulcer development involves over- expression of matrix metallo-proteases (MMPs) that are not substantially balanced by their physiological tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). MMPs cause a substrate-specific degradation of matrix components, including collagen, elastin and laminin. Unrestricted MMP activity can lead to matrix break down and ulcer onset. Some experiments demonstrate that local iron overload may induce MMP hyper-activation through the so-called MMP iron-driven pathway. However, the iron hypothesis does not readily explain why leg iron deposits in CVD produce lesions only in some individuals. We hypothesized that such individual differences could be genetically determined, and investigated the role of the C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations of the HFE gene, associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European populations. C 282 Y mutation significantly increases the risk of ulcer in primary CVD by more than six-fold, while patients carrying the H 63 D variant have an earlier age of ulcer onset by almost 10 years. HFE mutations are associated with increased iron efflux from the macrophage. Our findings support the hypothesis that lesions are promoted by enhanced iron release and ROS generation...|$|R
