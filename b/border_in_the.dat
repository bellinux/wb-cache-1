5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|Forte Tre Sassi (or Forte Tra i Sassi) is a {{fortress}} constructed in 1897 during the Austro-Hungarian period on the Passo Valparola. It lies between Sass de Stria and Piccolo Lagazuoi, dominating the passage between the Passo Falzarego and Val Badia in South Tyrol (Alto Adige). It {{was part of}} the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{late nineteenth and early twentieth}} century.|$|E

5|$|In 1534, Tabinshwehti and {{his deputy}} Bayinnaung, {{then a couple}} of 18-year-olds, {{launched}} their first military campaign against Hanthawaddy. It {{was the first of}} a series of wars by Toungoo that would engulf western and central mainland Southeast Asia for the next 80 years. In 1538–39, the upstart kingdom captured Hanthawaddy's capital Pegu (Bago), and in May 1541, Martaban (Mottama) and Moulmein (Mawlamyaing). Significantly, for the first time, the Burmese and the Siamese shared a common <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper-Tenasserim coast.|$|E
5|$|In 1641, Massachusetts {{expanded}} inland significantly, {{acquiring the}} Connecticut River Valley settlement of Springfield, which had recently disputed with, and defected {{from its original}} administrators, the Connecticut Colony.

5|$|The Bohemian waxwing has a {{circumpolar}} distribution, breeding {{in northern}} regions of Eurasia and North America.

5|$|A forward {{command post}} of the HV General Staff was moved from Ogulin to Slunj, and it assumed direct {{command of the}} 1st Guards Brigade, the 14th Home Guard Regiment and the 99th Brigade.

Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th Home Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojnić in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd Home Guard Brigade and the 137th Home Guard Regiment. Other HV units joined them by evening.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US <b>border.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 6 April 1941, units of the 4th Army were located at their {{mobilisation}} centres or were marching toward the Hungarian border. LI Infantry Corps seized the intact bridge over the Mura at Gornja Radgona. About 05:20, the Yugoslav 601st Independent Battalion on the <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prekmurje region forward of Detachment Ormozki was attacked by German troops advancing across the Reich border, and began withdrawing south into the Međimurje region. About 06:20, Germans troops also crossed the Hungarian border and attacked border troops at Dolnja Lendava. Shortly after this, further attacks were made along the Drava between Ždala and Gotalovo {{in the area of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska with the intention of securing crossings over the river, but they were unsuccessful. The Germans cleared most of Prekmurje up to Murska Sobota and Ljutomer during the day.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|Northern England or the North of England, {{also known}} simply as the North, is the {{northern}} part of England, considered as a single cultural area. It extends from the Scottish <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north to near the River Trent in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331km2 (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanisation, including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, South and West Yorkshire.|$|E

The route continues to the northeast, intersecting with Humphries Road, where the surroundings become highly undeveloped.

5|$|The 13th century brought {{fundamental}} {{changes to the}} structure of Polish society and its political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland {{in the second half of}} the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the Sławno and Słupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gdańsk Pomerania became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Bolesław II the Bald granted Lubusz Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western <b>border.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Army was not {{directly}} attacked {{during the first}} few days after the invasion commenced, but attacks on its flanks resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Danube and then the Sava. The Hungarians then crossed the <b>border</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sector for which the 1st Army had been responsible, but the Yugoslavs were already withdrawing and the Hungarians faced almost no resistance. This was followed by the German capture of Belgrade and the rear area units of 1st Army. Remnants of the 1st Army continued to resist along the line of the Sava, within days, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers had been captured. The Germans closed on Sarajevo, and accepted the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April, which came into effect at the following day.|$|E
