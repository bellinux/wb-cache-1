5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that <b>basalt</b> underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the <b>basalt</b> below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor <b>basalt</b> lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor <b>basalt.</b> These <b>basalt</b> samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. <b>Basalt</b> flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by <b>basalt</b> which are separated by adjacent drainages.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from <b>basalt</b> mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey <b>basalt</b> known as Cerro Cintepec <b>basalt</b> after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec <b>basalt</b> boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E
50|$|Using {{terrestrial}} classification schemes, all mare <b>basalts</b> {{are classified}} as tholeiitic, but specific subclassifications have been invented to further describe the population of lunar <b>basalts.</b> Mare <b>basalts</b> are generally grouped into three series based on their major element chemistry: high-Ti <b>basalts,</b> low-Ti <b>basalts,</b> and very-low-Ti (VLT) <b>basalts.</b> While these groups were {{once thought to be}} distinct based on the Apollo samples, global remote sensing data from the Clementine mission now shows that there is a continuum of titanium concentrations between these end members, and that the high-titanium concentrations are the least abundant. TiO2 abundances can reach up to 15 wt.% for mare <b>basalts,</b> whereas most terrestrial <b>basalts</b> have abundances much less than 4 wt.%. A special group of lunar <b>basalts</b> is the KREEP <b>basalts,</b> which are abnormally rich in potassium (K), rare earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P). A major difference between terrestrial and lunar <b>basalts</b> is the near-total absence of water in any form in the lunar <b>basalts.</b> Lunar <b>basalts</b> do not contain hydrogen-bearing minerals like the amphiboles and phyllosilicates that are common in terrestrial <b>basalts</b> due to alteration or metamorphism.|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{synthesis}} of chemical data for over 200 samples, the nonmare rocks with fine grained melt textures can be classified into 7 major groups: anorthositic <b>basalts,</b> troctolitic <b>basalts,</b> VHA <b>basalts,</b> Apollo 14 -type KREEP <b>basalts,</b> Apollo 15 -type KREEP <b>basalts,</b> Apollo 17 -type KREEP <b>basalts,</b> and aluminous mare <b>basalts.</b> Review of chemical, mineralogical, textural and experimental evidence leads to preferred hypotheses for the origins of these rocks; those hypotheses are discussed in detail...|$|R
50|$|Mare <b>basalts</b> {{are named}} as such because they {{frequently}} constitute {{large portions of}} the lunar maria.

The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary <b>basalt</b> and <b>basalt</b> and gabbros respectively.

5|$|In {{the late}} 10th century and early 9th century BC, {{the site was}} reoccupied but its name during that time is unknown; three human head sculptures made of <b>basalt</b> were {{discovered}} in the site; they probably date to the mid-9th century BC.

40|$|Olivine-normative mare <b>basalts</b> {{are present}} on the Apennine Front as {{crystalline}} particles and shocked or shock-melted fragments. Picritic <b>basalts,</b> which {{may be related to}} the olivine-normative <b>basalts</b> by olivine accumulation, not only occur on the Front but such samples so far recognized are confined to it. Mare volcanic and impact glasses also occur on the Front; all are olivine-normative, though none are quite the equivalent of the typical olivine-normative mare group. The quartz-normative mare <b>basalts</b> are not present (or are extremely rare) on the Front either as crystalline <b>basalts</b> or shocked or glass equivalents. These observations are consistent with the olivine-normative mare <b>basalts</b> being both local and the youngest flows at the site, and the fragments being emplaced on the Front by impacts. The picritic <b>basalts</b> raise the distinct possibility that the olivine-normative <b>basalts</b> also ponded on the Front. An influx of olivine-normative <b>basalts</b> from exotic sources (e. g., a ray from Aristillus) is inconsistent with their abundance, their dominance in the mare soil chemistry, and their age, isotopic, and trace element similarities with the quartz-normative <b>basalts.</b> However, the thermal histories of the olivine-normative <b>basalts</b> require elucidation...|$|R

Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass.

40|$|Mafic tholeiitic <b>basalts</b> {{from the}} Nejapa and Granada (NG) cinder cone {{alignments}} provide {{new insights into}} the origin and evolution of magmas at convergent plate margins. In comparison to other <b>basalts</b> from the Central American volcanic front, these marie tholeiitic <b>basalts</b> are high in MgO and CaO and low in Al 2 Oj, K 2 O, Ba and Sr. They also differ from other Central American <b>basalts,</b> in having clinopyroxene phenocrysts with higher MgO, CaO and Cr 2 O 3 concentrations and olivine phenocrysts with higher MgO contents. Except for significantly higher concentrations of Ba, Sr and "Sr/^Sr, most of the tholeiites are indistinguishable in composition from mid-ocean ridge <b>basalts.</b> In general, phenocryst mineral compositions are also very similar between NG tholeiites and mid-ocean ridge <b>basalts.</b> The <b>basalts</b> as a whole can be divided into two groups based on relative TiO 2 -K 2 O concentrations.

The lower contents of Zr and light REE and magnesian primary olivines in the wet <b>basalts</b> could have resulted from a higher degree of partial melting (20 %) of a hydrous source mantle compared with 10 % melting of a dry source mantle.
