The reflex sight is illuminated by ambient light during the day and uses battery powered illumination for use at night.

5000|$|Deceleration bullet traps direct bullets into a helical or {{circular}} chamber {{in which}} the bullet may circle until it loses velocity and drops {{to the bottom of}} the chamber for collection. For use with multiple firing positions, the helical chamber often resembles a horizontal pipe, into which bullets are directed by upper and lower steel plates. The upper plate slopes downward and the lower plate slopes upward to a horizontal slot in the side of the helical chamber. Alternatively, some narrow deceleration traps for single firing positions employ vertical plates to direct bullets into a helical deceleration chamber resembling a vertical pipe from which spent <b>bullets</b> <b>drop</b> out the lower end. Lightweight versions suitable for capturing airgun pellets are often used behind electronic scoring systems on ranges configured for ISSF 10 metre airgun events. The plate slopes are shallow (about 18° [...] ) so bullets may be deflected relatively intact rather than disintegrated upon impact. Some deceleration traps use an oil and/or water coating to reduce friction and capture dust.|$|R
