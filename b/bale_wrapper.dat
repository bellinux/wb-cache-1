50|$|A <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper</b> is a farm {{implement}} for wrapping bales in plastic, {{for them to}} turn into silage.|$|E
50|$|McHale {{produced}} {{their first}} square <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper</b> in 1995. It was launched on the market. From here the company developed {{a range of}} Square wrappers for field and static wrapping.|$|E
5000|$|A Satellite <b>Bale</b> <b>Wrapper</b> usually {{consists}} of hydraulic driven bale supporting rollers and a Hydraulic driven rotating satellite arm which carries the plastic film roll and Dispensing unit. The {{rotation of the}} support rollers and the satellite arm are synchronized so that an even cover of plastic film {{is applied to the}} bale as the wrapping process takes place. High speed satellite wrappers have two rotating satellite arms which effectively halves the time taken to wrap a bale.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bale</b> <b>wrappers</b> come in {{two main}} forms - Turntable type and Satellite type ...|$|R
50|$|The late 1980s saw McHale {{manufacture}} {{its first}} round Balewrapper {{and take the}} brave step to specialise in this area. In the early years {{a lot of time}} was spent developing this product in line with end user requirements. The company subsequently developed a range of round <b>bale</b> <b>wrappers</b> for field and static wrapping. McHale saw that the future in agriculture lay in the round and square bale markets.|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and <b>bale</b> <b>wrappers</b> silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} form of wrapping {{uses the}} same type of bale placed on a <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper,</b> consisting of pair of rollers on a turntable mounted on the three-point linkage of a tractor. It is then spun about two axes while being wrapped in several layers of cling-wrap plastic film. This covers the ends and sides of the bale in one operation, thus sealing it separately from other bales. The bales are then moved or stacked using a special pincer attachment on the front loader of a tractor, which does not damage the film seal. They can also be moved using a standard bale spike, but this punctures the airtight seal, and the hole in the film must be repaired after each move.|$|E
5000|$|For {{animals that}} eat silage, a <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper</b> {{may be used}} to seal a round bale {{completely}} and trigger the fermentation process. It is a technique used as a money-saving process by producers who {{do not have access to}} a silo, and for producing silage that is transported to other locations. However, a silo is still a preferred method for making silage. In very damp climates, it is a legitimate alternative to drying hay completely and when processed properly, the natural fermentation process prevents mold and rot. Round bale silage is also sometimes called [...] "haylage", and is seen more commonly in Europe than in either the United States or Australia. However, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to spoilage.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{alternative}} method, the cut vegetation is baled, making balage (North America) or silage bales (UK). The grass or other forage is cut and partly dried until it contains 30-40% moisture (much drier than bulk silage, but too damp {{to be stored}} as dry hay). It is then made into large bales which are wrapped tightly in plastic to exclude air. The plastic may wrap the whole of each cylindrical or cuboid bale, or be wrapped around only the curved sides of a cylindrical bale, leaving the ends uncovered. In this case, the bales are placed tightly end to end on the ground, making a long continuous [...] "sausage" [...] of silage, often {{at the side of}} a field. The wrapping may be performed by a <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper,</b> while the baled silage is handled using a bale handler or a front-loader, either impaling the bale on a flap, or by using a special grab. The flaps do not hole the bales.|$|E
50|$|McHale is a firm {{manufacturing}} a {{range of}} farm machinery. McHale {{is located in the}} West of Ireland in the town of Ballinrobe, which is approximately 40 km North of Galway City.McHale manufacture numerous products including Integrated Baler <b>Wrappers,</b> Balers, <b>Wrappers,</b> <b>Bale</b> Handling Equipment, Shear Grabs and Bale Splitters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of baler in industrialized {{countries}} today is the round baler. It produces cylinder-shaped [...] "round" [...] or [...] "rolled" [...] bales. The design has a [...] "thatched roof" [...] effect that withstands weather well. Grass is rolled up inside the baler using rubberized belts, fixed rollers, or a combination of the two. When the bale reaches a predetermined size, either netting or twine is wrapped around it to hold its shape. The back of the baler swings open, and the bale is discharged. The bales are complete at this stage, but they may also be wrapped in plastic sheeting by a <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper,</b> either to keep hay dry when stored outside or convert damp grass into silage. Variable-chamber large round balers typically produce bales from 48 to 72 in in diameter and up to 60 in in width. The bales can weigh anywhere from 1100 to 2200 lb, depending upon size, material, and moisture content. Common modern small round balers (also called [...] "mini round balers" [...] or [...] "roto-balers") produce bales 20 to 22 in in diameter and 20.5 to 28 in in width, generally weighing from 40 to 55 lb.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{in the use of}} raw materials and the diffusion of energy efficient processes/components are necessary, nowadays, from both the economic and the sustainable viewpoints. This paper presents the design of a new and innovative multi-functional agricultural machinery able to integrate three separate traditional implements used for hay raking, hay baling and bale wrapping (i. e. hay rake, round baler, <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper</b> machines) with the aim of speeding up the harvesting operations and reducing both the energy consumption and the whole environmental impact. A comparative analysis of the environmental burden related to the adoption of traditional implements together with the new multi-functional device is reported and a significant reduction of fuel consumption, labor and environmental impact is observed close to 28 %. The study is conducted by the adoption of the Life Cycle Assessment methodology, through which impact indicators of different damage categories (human health, ecosystem quality and resource depletion) are carefully quantified and highlighted...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{in the use of}} raw materials and the spread of energy efficient processes and components are necessary from both the economic and the environmental viewpoints. This paper presents the design of an innovative multi-functional agricultural machinery able to integrate three separate traditional implements used for hay raking, hay baling and bale wrapping, i. e. hay rake, round baler and <b>bale</b> <b>wrapper</b> machines, with the aim of speeding up the harvesting operations and reducing both the energy consumption and the global environmental impact. A comparative analysis about the adoption of the traditional implements and the new multi-functional machinery is reported. Particularly, the {{reduction in}} both the fuel consumption (32 %), the human labor (66. 7 %) is discussed together with a differential environmental analysis of the proposed system and the traditional implements. To meet such a last purpose, the study adopts the life cycle assessment methodology carefully quantifying the impact indicators for three different categories, i. e. human health, ecosystem quality and resource depletion. The results highlight a global environmental impact reduction of about 35 %. The proposed system represents an effective and competitive improvement to ease and speed the haymaking process and to reduce the environmental impact of such a key farmer activity...|$|E
