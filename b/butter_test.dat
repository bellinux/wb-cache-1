5000|$|The peanut <b>butter</b> <b>test</b> is a {{diagnostic}} test {{which aims to}} detect Alzheimer's disease by measuring subjects' ability to smell peanut butter through each nostril. The test was originally reported in October 2013 by researchers from the University of Florida's McKnight Brain Institute, led by professor Kenneth Heilman, and involves measuring the ability of patients to smell peanut butter held close to their nose. The researchers concluded that patients with Alzheimer's {{were not able to}} smell the peanut butter as well through their left nostril as their right one. The study's lead author, graduate student Jennifer Stamps, got the idea for the study when, while studying under Professor Heilman, she noticed that none of his patients had been tested for their sense of smell. The idea of using peanut butter came to Stamps when she administered it to patients as part of a routine test of cranial nerve function. Their decision to use it was also motivated {{by the fact that it}} is a pure odorant (i.e. is only detected by the olfactory nerve), and that Heilman had told Stamps, [...] "If you can come up with something quick and inexpensive, we can do it." ...|$|E

The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate of 40 -% dry matter content, 30 -% (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 -% (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin). The second and third contained an extra 2 -% (w/w) antioxidant (ascorbic acid) and the third an extra 2 -% (w/w) cross-linking agent (dialdehyde starch). Protective layers on butter were produced by coating with coat solutions. Butters were stored {{for a total of}} 96 days in refrigerator at a temperature of 7 ± 1. 5 °C and relative humidity of 36 ± 3 %. The objective was to investigate the oxidation course of butter with protective coatings, butter wrapped in original wrapping and butter without wrapping/coat. Determined values were peroxide value, acid value and anisidine value. Results of butters with protective and edible polymer coatings displayed a similar oxidation course to that of butter in standard wrapping. Butter with a coat containing antioxidant exhibited slightly lower levels of peroxide value during storage than butter in original wrapping, which confirms good barrier properties to oxygen of the coating thus prepared...|$|R

The indentation tests were performed at different speeds (1, 6 and 60 mm. min− 1), and the corresponding force – displacement responses were fitted with an analytical solution to obtain the time-dependent constants and the instantaneous force–displacement response. Experiments have been performed on 18 different commercially available <b>butters.</b> A puncture <b>test</b> was performed to investigate the rheological properties of the food materials at 4 °C and at 19 °C.

40|$|Context: Oils {{and butter}} of seed from Brazilian {{biodiversity}} are extending {{the range of}} innovative products for cosmetics development. They have a fat potential similar to skin composition, leading to the improved performance of these product. Aims: Improve the emulsions spreadability through prior screening of grease composition and studying the viscosity, and the emulsions accelerated stability. Methods: Emulsions were formulated using oils from semiarid plants from Bahia: Syagrus coronate, Pachira retusa, and Pachira aquatica, so as to compare them with oils already standard {{in the production of}} cosmetics. Spreadability and stability tests were made comparing the results. The same criteria were used with Amazon seed butter: Virola surinamensis, Butyrospermum parkii, Astrocaryum murumuru, Theobroma cacao and Theobroma grandiflorum. For the emulsions screening and performance, a system was developed for oil/ <b>butter,</b> following <b>tests</b> of accelerated stability, viscosity, and spreadability. Results: The combined system of spreadability was optimized using screening. Emollients containing oleic and palmitic acids, and light chain fatty acids obtained good spreadability. The oil emulsion containing Pachira retusa and Virola surinamensis butter had a higher viscosity. Conclusions: With high content of fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic or the light chain fatty acids obtain an appropriated appearance, texture, and spreadability for cosmetic use. Thus, oils with a low fatty acid content may be combined with butter that have a high fatty acid content and vice-versa. Analyzing and strategically combining grease composition, one can optimize the performance of cosmetic formulations...|$|R

The strippers, seven in number, had been bred for a period of six and a half months, on an average. Special precautions were taken that the milk in no way could become mixed, as one of our men went night and morning to the barns to see the cows milked, and the milk put in its proper place after it was thoroughly aerated. It was then taken to the creamery and kept until it was separated. Both lots of cows were fed on the following rations: To each cow were given daily: Sheaf oats, 8 pounds; clover hay, 6 pounds; corn, 6 pounds; barley meal, 3 pounds; and sugar butts, 5 pounds...|$|R

40|$|Keloids develop when {{scar tissue}} {{responds}} to skin trauma with proliferative fibrous growths that {{extend beyond the}} boundaries of the original wound and progress for several months or years. Keloids most frequently occur in individuals of indigenous sub-Saharan African origin. The etiology for keloids is still unknown and treatment can be problematic as patients respond differently to various treatment modalities. Keloids have a high rate of recurrence following surgical excision. Some West African patients claim to have had successful outcomes with traditional African remedies—boa constrictor oil (BCO) and shea butter—leading the authors to investigate their effects on cultured fibroblasts. The effects of emulsions of BCO, fish oil, isolated omega- 3 fatty acids, and shea <b>butter</b> were <b>tested</b> in comparison to triamcinolone regarding inhibition of cell growth in keloid and control fibroblast cultures. In a series of controlled studies, it was observed that fish oil and BCO were more effective than triamcinolone, and that cis- 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 -eicosapentaenoic acid was more effective than -linolenic acid. While cell counts in control cultures continuously decreased over a period of 5 days, cell counts in keloid cultures consistently declined between day 1 and day 3, and then increased between day 3 and day 5 for all tested reagents except for fish oil. These results suggest that oils rich in omega- 3 fatty acids may be effective in reducing actively proliferating keloid fibroblasts. Additional studies are warranted to investigate whether oils rich in omega- 3 fatty acids offer effective and affordable treatment for some keloid patients, especially in the developing world...|$|R
40|$|A stable low-fat water-in-oil {{emulsion}} was satisfactorily prepared from milk-fat under laboratory condition. The best product contained 40 per cent fat, 56. 8 - 57. 3 per cent water, 0. 8 per cent sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0. 7 - 1. 2 per cent milk solids-non-fat, and 1. 2 percent salt.

40|$|Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are {{candidates}} {{for inclusion in}} the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. PCNs are structurally and toxicologically similar to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD) and its analogues. Intake in food is considered to be an important human exposure pathway for PCNs. In this preliminary study, cheese and butter samples were analysed for PCNs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) using an isotope dilution gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry method. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the PCN concentrations in the cheese and butter samples and to compare them with the PCDD, PCDF and PCB concentrations. The PCN concentrations were 5. 6 - 103 pgg(- 1) of wet weight in the seven cheese samples tested and 5. 0 - 199 pgg(- 1) of wet weight in the seven <b>butter</b> samples <b>tested.</b> The mass concentrations of lower chlorinated congeners were greater than those of the higher chlorinated congeners. Congeners of CN 45 / 36, CN 27 / 30 and CN 33 / 34 / 37 were much more abundant than other congeners found in tetrachlorinated PCNs. Congeners of CN 51, CN 66 / 67 and CN 73 were determined to be the predominant congeners in penta-, hexa- and heptachlorinated homologs, respectively. The PCNs contributed around 5 % of the total PCN, PCDD, PCDF and PCB toxic equivalence (TEQ) values. CN 73 was found to be the dominant PCN congener and contributed more than 40 % to the PCN TEQ value. Congeners CN 66 / 67, CN 69 and CN 63 were also found at relatively high levels. The PCB congener CB 118 was the predominant congener (by mass-based concentration) of the 12 dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs). The PCBs contributed 53. 8 % of the total TEQ, and congener CB 126 contributed more than any other compound that was analysed to the total TEQ.

40|$|Background: A {{positive}} {{association between}} nonfermented milk intake and increased all-cause mortality was recently reported, but overall, {{the association between}} dairy intake and mortality is inconclusive. Objective: We studied associations between intake of dairy products and all-cause mortality {{with an emphasis on}} nonfermented milk and fat content. Design: A total of 103, 256 adult participants (women: 51. 0 %) from Northern Sweden were included (7121 deaths; mean follow-up: 13. 7 y). Associations between all-cause mortality and reported intakes of nonfermented milk (total or by fat content), fermented milk, cheese, and <b>butter</b> were <b>tested</b> with the use of Cox proportional hazards models that were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, education, energy intake, examination year, and physical activity. To circumvent confounding, Mendelian randomization was applied in a subsample via the lactase LCT- 13910 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism that is associated with lactose tolerance and milk intake. Results: High consumers of nonfermented milk (≥ 2. 5 times/d) had a 32 % increased hazard (HR: 1. 32; 95 % CI: 1. 18, 1. 48) for all-cause mortality compared with that of subjects who consumed milk ≤ 1 time/wk. The corresponding value for butter was 11 % (HR: 1. 11; 95 % CI: 1. 07, 1. 21). All nonfermented milk-fat types were independently associated with increased HRs, but compared with full-fat milk, HRs were lower in consumers of medium-and low-fat milk. Fermented milk intake (HR: 0. 90; 95 % CI: 0. 86, 0. 94) and cheese intake (HR: 0. 93; 95 % CI: 0. 91, 0. 96) were negatively associated with mortality. Results were slightly attenuated by lifestyle adjustments but were robust in sensitivity analyses. Mortality was not significantly associated with the LCT- 13910 C/T genotype in the smaller subsample. The amount and type of milk intake was associated with lifestyle variables. Conclusions: In the present Swedish cohort study, intakes of nonfermented milk and butter are associated with higher all-cause mortality, and fermented milk and cheese intakes are associated with lower all-cause mortality. Residual confounding by lifestyle cannot be excluded, and Mendelian randomization needs to be examined in a larger sample. Am J Clin Nutr 2017; 105 : 1502 - 11...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phytanic acid {{produced}} in ruminants from chlorophyll may have preventive {{effects on the}} metabolic syndrome, partly due to its reported RXR and PPAR- α agonist activity. Milk from cows fed increased levels of green plant material, contains increased phytanic acid concentrations, but it is unknown to what extent minor increases in phytanic acid content in dairy fat leads to higher circulating levels of phytanic acid in plasma of the consumers. Objective To investigate if cow feeding regimes affects concentration of plasma phytanic acid and risk markers of the metabolic syndrome in human. Design In a double-blind, randomized, 4 wk, parallel intervention study 14 healthy young subjects were given 45 g milk fat/d from <b>test</b> <b>butter</b> and cheese with 0. 24 wt% phytanic acid or a control diet with 0. 13 wt% phytanic acid. Difference in phytanic acid was obtained by feeding roughage with low or high content of chlorophyll. Results There tended to be a difference in plasma phytanic acid (P = 0. 0730) concentration after the dietary intervention. Plasma phytanic acid increased significantly within both groups with the highest increase in control group (24 %) compared to phytanic acid group (15 %). There were no significant effects of phytanic acid on risk markers for the metabolic syndrome. Conclusions The results indicate that increased intake of dairy fat modify the plasma phytanic acid concentration, regardless of cows feeding regime and the minor difference in dietary phytanic acid. Whether the phytanic acid has potential to affects the risk markers of the metabolic syndrome in human still remain to be elucidated. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01343576 </p...|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} during October and November 2006 on 69 smallholder dairy farms with lactating cows in Mvomero and Njombe districts Tanzania, to determine the prevalence of mastitis and to assess the milk quality on the study farms. Clinical mastitis was investigated using clinical changes of udder and milk at animal level. Cow-side California Mastitis Test (CMT) and microbiological cultures {{were used to assess}} subclinical mastitis at quarter level. Milk quality was determined on bulk milk samples at herd level using alcohol and acidity <b>tests,</b> <b>butter</b> fat content, total solids, ash content as well as Delvotest® for antimicrobial residues. Overall prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd level in both districts was 21. 7 % (n = 69). Based on CMT, prevalence of subclinical mastitis at animal level was 51. 6 % (n = 91). Prevalence of bacterial isolates at animal level was 35. 2 % (n = 91) while for fungal it was 16. 7 % (n = 90). Based on CMT results, prevalence of subclinical mastitis at quarter level was 30 % (n = 353), while for bacteria and fungi it was 16 % and 6 % respectively. Contamination of milk with antimicrobial residues was 4. 5 % (n = 67). The milk quality parameters for most of the milk samples were within acceptable levels. Findings in this study have demonstrated high prevalence of subclinical mastitis that may contribute to low productivity of dairy cattle in both districts. About 20 % of CMT subclinical cases had no involvement of microbial pathogens that suggested the need for minimal interventions with antimicrobial agents. These findings call for use of udder disinfectants and improved milking hygiene as intervention strategies to control mastitis on the smallholder dairy farms in Tanzania...|$|R
