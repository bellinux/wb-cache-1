60|$|<b>Bounce</b> <b>stopped</b> his own talk at {{this point}} by {{stuffing}} his mouth so full of meat that no word, not even a word of one syllable, could have forced itself out, had it tried ever so much. A long silence now ensued, during which the clack of seven pairs of active jaws was the only sound that broke upon the ear. It might have been observed, however, that all eyes were fixed more or less wonderingly on the stranger. Big Waller in particular looked him, figuratively speaking, through and through. He did not remove his eyes off him for an instant, but devoured his food with somewhat {{the expression of a}} dog that expects his bone to be snatched from him.|$|R
30|$|From visual {{inspection}} of the data in Table 1, the reader will recognize that certain subjects tended to require more <b>bounces</b> to <b>stop</b> the oscillator. Other subjects {{may have been more}} skilled at interacting with dynamical systems. For instance, subject number three was a dexterous percussionist who attained the lowest (i.e., best) number of bounces for each model.|$|R

40|$|Reading act is {{performed}} by connected physiological, psychological and cognitive processes. The operations {{taking place in}} these processes are expected to continue for life by being developed with certain strategies. A lot of information is gained with reading skill in education life. Therefore, basic concepts that constitute reading education in teaching and improving reading are important for teachers. The {{aim of this study}} is to submit information compiled from the literature about reading education process and which basic concepts are used in reading education. While teaching reading from part to whole, from whole to part and interactional approaches are used. From part to whole approach is at the forefront. Then with interactional approach strategies, both code solving and making sense is improved. Teachers should know the characteristics of <b>bouncing,</b> <b>stopping,</b> turning back, and scanning movements of the eye both in code solving and making sense. The teacher should configure the teaching for the students to gain fluid reading elements by making use of reading out and reading silently. After reading act is acquired; good reader characteristics should be gained by improving asking questions, guessing, summarizing, interpretation skills in integrated readings. Reading skill is improved by studies on the text. Therefore, the students should come across texts that are suitable to their levels, textuality and readability criteria. The vocabulary of children should be improved in a planned way with text-based word and meaning studies. Fluid reading, making sense and interpretation skills of children should be pursued with different evaluation types. In the long term, work should be done to make reading a habit for them. ...|$|R
5000|$|A tower 4000 ft {{high with}} a system to drop a [...] "car" [...] {{suspended}} by a cable of [...] "best rubber" [...] was proposed for the Chicago World Fair, 1892-1893. The car, seating two hundred people, would be shoved from a platform on the tower and then <b>bounce</b> to a <b>stop.</b> The designer engineer suggested that for safety the ground below [...] "be covered with eight feet of feather bedding". The proposal was declined by the Fair's organizers.|$|R
30|$|During the collapse, the subsonically {{collapsing}} {{inner core}} (∼ 0.5 solar masses) contracts {{until it reaches}} densities comparable to that in atomic nuclei (∼ 4 - 5 × 10 ^ 14 g cm^- 3). At this point, the nuclear equation of state stiffens (due to the strong nuclear force). This halts {{the collapse of the}} inner core. It <b>stops,</b> <b>bounces</b> back and a proto-neutron star (PNS) is formed. The outer core, however, is still collapsing supersonically and a strong shock wave is launched at the interface between the inner and outer core.|$|R
50|$|After {{the lander}} <b>stopped</b> <b>bouncing</b> and rolling on the ground, {{it came to}} rest on the base of the {{tetrahedron}} or one of its sides. The sides then opened to make the base horizontal and the rover upright. The sides are connected to the base by hinges, each of which has a motor strong enough to lift the lander. The rover plus lander has a mass of about 533 kilograms (1,175 pounds). The rover alone has a mass of about 185 kg (408 lb). The gravity on Mars is about 38% of Earth's, so the motor {{does not need to be}} as powerful as it would on Earth.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{each level}} of Incidence {{is to get a}} ball into a hole in a set number of shots (4 shots to be precise). The player {{launches}} the ball by dragging back (which sets the power and angle of the shot). Once the ball is launched will bounce against the level's walls six times. On the sixth <b>bounce</b> the ball <b>stops</b> ready for the player to hit again. If the player runs out of shots (goes over par), the ball explodes and the player has to start the level over. If the player gets the ball into the hole, the player advances to the next level.|$|R
5000|$|Turing's {{reaction}} to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic: The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served {{by pointing out that}} we would not really use them in that way.Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the <b>bounce</b> with electronic <b>stop</b> finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really {{going to do something about}} it.|$|R
50|$|Happy, Tigger {{attempts}} to <b>bounce</b> but Rabbit <b>stops</b> him reminding Tigger of the promise he made. Devastated, Tigger realizes he cannot bounce anymore and slowly walks away and Rabbit feels better {{that there will}} be peace, but everyone else does not and felt sad to see Tigger depressed and remind Rabbit of the joy Tigger brought when he was bouncing. Then Rabbit shows sympathy for Tigger and takes back the promise they had agreed on; he is then given a friendly tackle by an overly-excited Tigger. Tigger invites everyone to bounce with him and even teaches Rabbit how to do it. For the first time, Rabbit is happy to be bouncing, as is everyone else as Tigger sings his signature song once more before the short closes.|$|R
50|$|Memphis {{attempted}} {{to answer the}} quick Owl score with {{one of their own}} after taking possession on their own 30-yard line. Martin Hankins completed several passes to drive the Tigers to their 48-yard line before the drive stalled in the face of tough defense from Florida Atlantic. Memphis was forced to punt the ball away {{for the second time in}} as many possessions. Though the Tigers were foiled on offense, the kick pinned Florida Atlantic inside its own 20-yard line. Thanks to the poor field position and good defensive play from Memphis, the Owls failed to reach their own 40-yard line and were forced to punt the ball for the first time in the game. Punter Keegan Peterson failed to connect accurately with the ball, which <b>bounced</b> to a <b>stop</b> at the Memphis 37-yard line after traveling just 28 yards. A first-down run by Hankins put the ball at the 50-yard line as the first quarter ended. A long pass downfield fell incomplete, and the quarter ended with Memphis facing a second-and-ten situation and losing by a score of 17-7.|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} Loop Quantum Cosmology matter bounce {{scenario}} {{in order to}} include a dark energy era, which ends abruptly at a Rip singularity where the scale factor and the Hubble rate diverge. In the "deformed matter bounce scenario", the Universe is contracting from an initial non-causal matter dominated era until it reaches a minimal radius. After that it expands in a decelerating way, until at late times, where it expands in an accelerating way, thus the model is described by a dark energy era that follows the matter dominated era. Depending on {{the choice of the}} free parameters of the model, the dark energy era is quintessential like which follows the matter domination era, and eventually it crosses the phantom divide line and becomes phantom. At the end of the dark energy era, a Rip singularity exists, where the scale factor and Hubble rate diverge, however the physical system cannot reach the singularity, since the effective energy density and pressure become complex. This indicates two things, firstly that the ordinary Loop Quantum Cosmology matter <b>bounce</b> evolution <b>stops,</b> thus ending the infinite repetition of the ordinary matter bounce scenario. Secondly, the fact that both the pressure and the density become complex indicates probably that the description of the cosmic evolution within the theoretical context of Loop Quantum Cosmology, ceases to describe the physics of the system and possibly a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity is needed near the would be Rip singularity. We describe the qualitative features of the model and we also investigate how this cosmology could be realized by a viscous fluid and scalar field in the context of LQC.

2500|$|After the Ashes {{had been}} {{retained}} Fingleton wrote {{that it would}} be sporting if the Fast bowlers <b>stopped</b> <b>bouncing</b> Hutton, whose left arm had been badly broken in the war - it had required 46 stitches to repair his arm, which was left two inches (5cm) shorter and another injury could end his career. It was also thought unsportsmanlike to bowl them at Paul Gibb who wore glasses. It was noted that though Bradman did not tell Lindwall and Miller to stop bowling bouncers in general as a good captain he did not allow them to bowl short at Cyril Washbrook. As well as being a resolute batsman Washbrook had a weakness for cutting the ball outside the off-stump, so that is where Bradman directed his bowlers and he received fewer short balls as a result. Denis Compton and Norman Yardley had weaknesses against the spinners, so Bradman would bring on Ian Johnson and Colin McCool to bowl to them. [...] "So it was that bumpers were not wanted. They were generally kept for those who had a real hatred for them, while a few additional slammers were indiscriminately thrown in for good measure against all and sundry".|$|R
60|$|Ordinarily this {{grounder}} of Tom's {{would have}} been easy for a novice to field. But this peculiar grounder, after it has hit the ground once, seemed to wake up and feel lively. It lost its leisurely action and began to have celerity. When it reached Dundon it had the strange, jerky speed so characteristic of the grounders that had confused the Madden's Hill team. Dundon got his hands on the ball and it would not stay in them. When finally he trapped it Tom had crossed first base and another runner had scored. Eddie Curtis cracked another at Bo. The Natchez captain dove for it, made a good <b>stop,</b> <b>bounced</b> after the rolling ball, and then threw to Kelly at first. The ball knocked Kelly's hands apart {{as if they had been}} paper. Jake Thomas batted left handed and he swung hard on a slow pitch and sent the ball far into right field. Runners scored. Jake's hit was a three-bagger. Then Frank Price hit up an infield fly. Bo yelled for Dundon to take it and Dundon yelled for Harris. They were all afraid to try for it. It dropped safely while Jake ran home.|$|R

50|$|After a {{courtship}} in which, {{among other}} things, Pecos Bill shoots {{all the stars}} from the sky except for one which becomes the Lone Star, Pecos proposes to Sue. She insists on riding Widow-Maker before, during or after the wedding (depending on variations in the story). Widow-Maker, jealous of no longer having Bill's undivided attention, bounces Sue off; she lands on her bustle and begins bouncing higher and higher. Pecos attempts, but fails, to lasso her, because Widow-Maker didn't want her on his back again, and she eventually hits {{her head on the}} moon. After she has been bouncing for days, Pecos Bill realizes that she would eventually starve to death, so he lassos her with Shake the rattlesnake and brings her back down. Widow-Maker, realizing that what he did to her was wrong, apologizes. In Bowman's version of the story, Sue eventually recovers from the bouncing but is so traumatized by the experience she never talks to Pecos Bill again. Though it is said that Bill was married many times, he never liked the others as much as Sue, and the other relationships didn't work out. In some versions, Sue couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>bouncing,</b> and Bill couldn't <b>stop</b> her <b>bouncing</b> either, so Bill had to shoot her to put her out of her misery. Although he married many times after that, he never loved a girl as much as Sue.|$|R
5000|$|During the fall, Tigger {{has been}} {{bouncing}} on anyone {{he comes across}} for fun, especially Rabbit when he is gardening, which angers Rabbit, so he calls a meeting with Pooh and Piglet and formulates a plan to prevent Tigger from bouncing: abandon Tigger in the woods, and find him the next day so hopefully Tigger will <b>stop</b> <b>bouncing</b> on his friends unexpectedly. Initially the plan seems to work, but when Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet cannot find their way home, Pooh makes a suggestion about following a sandpit {{in order to find}} {{their way out of the}} forest. In an attempt to prove Pooh wrong, Rabbit wanders away. Pooh and Piglet then fall asleep, but are woken by Pooh's empty stomach. He explains to Piglet that his honeypots have been calling to his tummy from home and that he couldn't hear them over Rabbit's voice. Pooh and Piglet find their way out of the forest, but are immediately bounced by Tigger. Piglet, realizing that the plan failed, mentions Rabbit's plan, and Tigger goes into the forest to find him. Rabbit walks through the forest by himself, and is scared by numerous noises such as a caterpillar eating a leaf and frogs croaking. Rabbit tries to run away in a panic, only to be tackled by Tigger. Rabbit is humiliated that his plan to lose Tigger had failed. Tigger explains to him that [...] "Tiggers never get lost", and takes Rabbit home.|$|R

40|$|The Hobbs Act, codified at 18 U. S. C. § 1951, criminalizes bribery of and {{extortion}} {{by public}} officials. Under the statute, “‘extortion’ means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right. ” But {{the meaning of}} “under color of official right” remains ambiguous. This Note examines the ambiguity created by the phrase “under color of official right” to decide whether a candidate for public office can be held accountable under the Hobbs Act for extortion. More specifically, this Note addresses whether a candidate for office qualifies as a public official who can violate § 1951 (a) of the Hobbs Act by accepting a bribe {{in return for a}} promise of future action if the candidate is elected. This Note argues that candidates for public office who accept bribes in return for a promise of future action ought to be, and in fact are, prosecutable under the Hobbs Act. Excluding candidates for public office from the reach of the Hobbs Act would be inconsistent with public policy. Indeed, this would be fundamentally inconsistent with basic Western sensibilities, which recognize that public official corruption “destroys democracy, replacing the vote of the people with the vote of the dollar. ” Because of uncertainty as to whether the Hobbs Act applies to candidates for public office, prosecutors usually rely on 18 U. S. C. § 599, titled “Promise of appointment by candidate,” as an alternative to prosecute candidates for office who receive bribes. Under this weaker statutory alternative, a candidate for office who takes a bribe during an election faces at most two years in prison for his crime, compared to a maximum of twenty years in prison if the candidate is prosecuted under the Hobbs Act. This effectively hobbles the Hobbs Act, stripping away its significant deterrent value for non-incumbent candidates. Therefore, courts should <b>stop</b> <b>bouncing</b> the proverbial blank check, and treat candidates for office as public officials who can violate the Hobbs Act by accepting bribes in return for promised official action once elected...|$|R
