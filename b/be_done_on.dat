5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. He {{gave it the}} common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more work to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work needed to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the armament, {{but it had to}} wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E

5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} starting position {{and there is}} an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. This can only <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the very next move, otherwise the right to do so is forfeit. For example, in the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it via en passant on g6 (but only on White's next move).|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to <b>Be</b> <b>Done?</b> <b>On</b> July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|Small scale can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
5|$|The {{place where}} Ahalya is held to have practised her penance and was {{redeemed}} has been celebrated in scriptures as a sacred {{place called the}} Ahalya-tirtha. A tirtha is a sacred place with a body of water, where pilgrims generally bathe to purify themselves. The location of the Ahalya-tirtha is disputed: according to some scriptures, {{it is on the}} river Godavari, others place it on the river Narmada. Two sites are widely held to be the Ahalya-tirtha. One is located near Ahalyeshvara Temple in Bhalod, {{on the banks of the}} Narmada; another is located in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The Ahilya Asthan temple in Ahalya-gram ("Ahalya's village") in the same district is dedicated to Ahalya. For those seeking to attract women and be handsome like the love-god Kamadeva, the Matsya Purana and the Kurma Purana prescribe the worship of Ahalya at the Ahalya-tirtha. This is to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the day of Kamadeva, in the Hindu month of Chaitra. According to the texts, he who bathes in the tirtha will enjoy pleasure with the celestial nymphs.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six planting dates were used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading were recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) were reported when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity were recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as planting was delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) were recorded when planting was delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) was recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as planting was delayed. Minimum Plant height (85 cm) was recorded when planting was delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) was recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as planting was delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) was observed when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 15 th of December. A negative correlation was recorded between planting dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late planting recorded were 8 % when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> November 15 th, 22 % loss when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 25 th November, 34 % losses were incurred when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> December 5 th and 42 % losses were recorded when planting was further delayed till December 15 th. Hence it is concluded that {{first two weeks of}} November is the best time for obtaining higher yields from the recommended cultivars...|$|R
