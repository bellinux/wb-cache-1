50|$|When a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> {{has gone}} through its credit {{work-out}} process, {{the remains of the}} <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> is often asset ownership. Therefore, the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> in its life span changes dramatically from being at the outset basically a bank with a large number of loans to later in life a large asset-owning company. A common mistake is to think of this last phase of the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> as a kind of investment company. An investment company has very well defined objectives regarding what type of assets they want to acquire. They choose the assets they want to acquire. A <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> gets all the assets that are left after the credit work-out process.|$|E
50|$|In early 2009, Citigroup dumped {{more than}} $700 {{billion worth of}} {{impaired}} assets into <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> Citi Holdings. By 2012, the Citi Holdings <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> represented 9% of the total Citigroup balance sheet.|$|E

50|$|The {{first year}} of the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> determines its success. The {{challenge}} is the large number of non-performing loans {{in a wide variety of}} situations with regards to geographical location, type of industry, size and type of problem. If the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> does not quickly get control of the loans, a lot of value is lost and the capital requirements of the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> can change dramatically. To be successful, a well-defined process on how to handle the different loans has to be established. This process has to be followed and managed with force and speed in the organisation. If not, the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> will easily end up in chaos.|$|E
5000|$|Such <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> {{institutions}} {{have been created}} to address challenges arising during an economic credit crunch to allow private banks to take problem assets off their books.The financial crisis of 2007-2010 resulted in bad banks being set up in several countries. For example, a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> was suggested {{as part of the}} Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to help address the subprime mortgage crisis in the US. In the Republic of Ireland, a <b>bad</b> <b>bank,</b> the National Asset Management Agency was established in 2009, in response to the financial crisis in that country.|$|E

The board and CEO were replaced on 27 March. The <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> was being run by a Special Administrator Ms Andri Antoniadou who was acting CEO until 3 March 2015. Veteran banker Chris Pavlou took over as Special Administrator in April 2015 until December 2016.|$|E
5000|$|McWilliams said that, {{providing}} the banks were reformed, {{some sort of}} “bad bank” would be necessary.One idea is to divide our banks into good and <b>bad</b> <b>banks.</b> We could set up one or two <b>bad</b> <b>banks,</b> which would be [...] "financial skips" [...] into which we throw bad loans.In 2009 McWilliams criticised NAMA as proposed, and was in turn criticised by Brian Lenihan. The Minister for Finance took the unprecedented step of attacking the commentator in a full-page editorial piece in the Irish Independent.|$|R
40|$|This 4 th {{semester}} {{project is}} analyzing {{the reasons behind}} the 2008 bankruptcy of Roskilde Bank. On the theoretical level Friedman´s Monetarism is analyzed alongside Keynesianism, comparing the two {{and the effects of}} the financial liberation taking place since the 1980 ´ s. In order to assess other possible reasons for the bankruptcy, the Principal/Agent theory is used to analyze whether the bank management was working as efficiently and professionally as it is expected from a management in a bank of this size. It is analyzed that the bankruptcy {{is a result of the}} financial liberation mentioned above, combined with a too big and risky exposure towards the real-estate market. These two factors aggregated with <b>bad</b> <b>banking</b> caused this particular bankruptcy. The exposure to the real-estate market was a consequence of <b>bad</b> <b>banking.</b> It is concluded that there cannot be legislated against bankruptcies as the one analyzed in the paper, as there cannot be legislated against <b>bad</b> <b>banking...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{appears to}} be common wisdom that the basic cause of Thailand's crisis is its {{extraordinarily}} weak financial institutions. The article questions this proposition from an empirical viewpoint. It is well established that the long-term performance of Thailand's financial system is favourable. The insight from moral hazard indicators is unexpected regarding the <b>bad</b> <b>banking</b> proposition, although not compelling. Finally, the liberalisation process produced inadequately addressed risks. However, this also applies to experienced and well-regulated foreign banks. It is argued that the facts provided can be better explained in a framework of system change than by <b>bad</b> <b>banking</b> in Thailand. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{organisational}} requirements {{are very different}} in a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> than in a normal bank. A good bank is a 'process' organisation while a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> is a 'project' organisation. The skill set and the emphasis on type of skills are different in a restructuring and winding up situation than in a lending situation.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to segregating or removing the bad assets from parent banks' balance sheet, a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> structure permits specialized management {{to deal with}} the problem of bad debts. The approach allows good banks to focus on their core business of lending while the <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> can specialize in maximizing value from the high risk assets.|$|E

40|$|A {{regulator}} resolving a bank faces two audiences: depositors, who may run if {{they believe}} the regulator will not provide capital, and banks, which may take excess risk {{if they believe}} the regulator will provide capital. When the regulator's cost of injecting capital is private information, it manages expectations by using costly signals: (i) A regulator with a low cost of injecting capital may forbear on <b>bad</b> <b>banks</b> to signal toughness and reduce risk taking, and (ii) A regulator with a high cost of injecting capital may bail out <b>bad</b> <b>banks</b> to increase confidence and prevent runs. Regulators perform more informative stress tests when the market is pessimistic...|$|R

50|$|The first bank {{to use the}} <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> {{strategy}} was Mellon Bank, which created a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> entity in 1988 to hold $1.4 billion of bad loans. Initially, the Federal Reserve was reluctant to issue a charter to the new bank, Grant Street National Bank, but Mellon's CEO, Frank Cahouet, persisted and the regulators eventually agreed.|$|E

This vehicle would not be a <b>bad</b> <b>bank</b> because it would not have a financial business. Real estate divisions were not suitable either, as they would be consolidated in balance sheets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} deposit flows in failed banks and (a control) sample of non-failed banks over the 1929 - 1933 period. Evidence of significant contagion effects were found for the 1930 - 1932 period. No apparent contagion effects were found for the 1930 - 1932 period. No apparent contagion effects existed in the 1929 or 1933. It was {{also found that the}} pace of contagion accelerated between 1929 and 1932, indicative of a learning effect among depositors. Interestingly, even in the period of contagion there were a significant number of informed depositors who could distinguish among good and <b>bad</b> <b>banks.</b> This is despite the fact that this period preceded the establishment of the FDIC and the SEC and their associated information production requirement for banks. Finally, our results suggest that in the pre- 1933 period there was a significant amount of depositor discipline on <b>bad</b> <b>banks.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between financial intermediation and employment. We explain why some economies have low financial inter-mediation even when financial intermediation is safe for depositors. Moreover, we seek to explain why these economies tend to be poor and vulnerable, and also have large self-employment even though the latter has low productivity. We show {{that the effects of}} <b>bad</b> <b>banking</b> can be overcome only partially by corrective taxes...|$|R
