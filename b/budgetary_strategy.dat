40|$|The {{best way}} to work out how much money the ABC needs may be to look at its competitors, writes Rodney Tiffen ONE of the {{recurring}} motifs in Australian political life is the ABC saying it needs more money, and the government saying it won’t give more. The essential {{problem is that the}} ABC’s funding has no relationship to its performance. Its revenue does not go up if its audiences rise, or vary with their relative satisfaction. Rather, its budget is determined by extraneous factors, such as the government’s general <b>budgetary</b> <b>strategy,</b> or its degree of political hostility to the national broadcaster. Although there is no objective basis for saying at what level the ABC should be funded, the debate does not have to proceed in a data vacuum. We have three sets of available comparisons, and each suggests that the ABC is not generously funded. A first source of data, which is used quite often, is to look at trends over time. ABC managing director Russell Balding said last year that in real terms the ABC’s budget in 2003 was about 70 per cent of what it had been in 1985, a substantial cut. A second, more rarely used source of data is to look outward, to compare the ABC with public service broadcasters in other advanced democracies. The ABC ranks near the bottom, compared with national broadcasters in 16 other countries. In 1999, it ranked second-last in terms of revenue per head of population. It received $US 29 per year, compared with the mean for the others of $US 63. A third source of data has almost never been used - namely, to compare the ABC’s budget with that of the commercial networks in Australia. This is a strange omission because this comparison is directly relevant to the environment the ABC must operate in. Moreover, the results may surprise many, especially those who like to contrast the flabby and inefficient public sector with the lean, mean private sector. According to research by Professor Glenn Withers at the ANU, the average hour of ABC television costs 42 per cent as much as the average hour on commercial television, while for radio the equivalent figure is 40 per cent. Moreover, both figures have fallen over time. In 1981, the figures were 71 per cent and 48 per cent respectively. So, in relation to commercial television, the ABC’s costs have fallen dramatically. While some economists may see this as an increase in efficiency, many viewers probably suspect it has meant a decline in quality. By all measures, the ABC is relatively poorly funded. What level should it be funded at? Friends of the ABC might think it deserves to be funded at the same level as the commercials. But no Australian government in 2004 would dispense such largesse. Perhaps ABC lobbyists could adopt the modest request: ‘Give the ABC half what the commercials get. ’ Associate Professor Rodney Tiffen is the author, with Ross Gittins, of How Australia Compares (Cambridge University Press, 2004).

40|$|Daunting {{fiscal policy}} {{challenges}} face democratic systems throughout the world. Fiscal austerity {{in the wake}} of the Great Recession prompted nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to institute major spending cuts and tax increases, increases that caused political and social fallout for years to come. While economies and budgets have improved in the past several years, significant fiscal adjustments lie ahead due to aging populations and the seemingly inexorable growth of health care costs. Faced with larger cohorts of retirees and fewer workers, nations will have to come to grips with a fiscal reality of higher spending and lower revenues for the foreseeable future. This article examines whether and how fiscal austerity measures are politically stabilizing or destabilizing for elected leaders responsible for their imposition. Many would predict that democracies are ill suited to make these hard choices, and certainly regimes have gone down to defeat following the formulation of austerity programs. However, the record is mixed-many regimes have found strategies to mitigate the political fallout and guarantee reelection {{in the wake of}} austerity. While traditional incremental and pluralist politics continue to characterize the <b>budgetary</b> <b>strategies</b> of many systems, major policy reforms have risen to the center of policy agendas elsewhere.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to support the European Parliament’s ITRE Committee in its work on the EU's industrial and energy policy and to give advice on the following issues: Why is the issue of resource scarcity back on the agenda? What are the strategic conclusions for the EU? What can the EU expect from eco-innovation in a large range of industrial sectors? Are existing measures meeting the EU aims and expectations, and what new policy initiatives should be set forward? To meet these objectives, this study is structured as follows: Chapter 2 will give an overview on resource scarcities. Chapter 3 elaborates on ecoinnovation, including trends, barriers and driving forces. Chapter 4 outlines proposals for future EU policies. Chapter 5 sketches out a possible vision for the future. Chapter 2 reveals recent findings on resource scarcity: Global extraction of natural resource is steadily increasing. Since 1980, global extraction of abiotic (fossil fuels, minerals) and biotic (agriculture, forestry, fishing) resources has augmented from 40 to 58 billion tonnes in 2005. Scenarios anticipate a total resource extraction of around 80 billion tonnes in 2020 (200 % of the 1980 -value), necessary to sustain the worldwide economic growth. On average, a European consumes per year around three times the amount of resources of a citizen in the emerging countries while producing twice as much. Analysis on patterns of current resource use (direct and indirect use) is still in its infancy and shows data gaps. Based on country studies, however, one can arrive at tentative conclusions. A recent study on Germany reveals that ten production sectors account for more than 50 % of German Total Material Requirements (TMR). Industries of three areas are of strategic importance because here a huge number of technological interactions among production sectors take place: • Stones, construction, and housing = housing • Metals and car manufacturing = mobility • Agriculture, food and nutrition = food. The rapidly increasing demand for resources has led to an unprecedented boost in resource prices, especially during the last five years until the breakout of the financial crisis in Fall 2008. The EU is the world region that outsources the biggest part of resource extraction. In comparison to the overall global growth rate (45 % over the last 25 years), Europe’s resource extraction grew only by 3 %, but studies show that these domestic raw materials are increasingly substituted by imports from other world regions. World reserves in fossil fuels and metals are unevenly distributed across the world regions. Additionally, for various commodities, the peak of extraction has already been reached or is currently about to be reached. Not only for oil and gas, but also for critical metals such as Antimon, Gallium, Indium, Platinum and others the supply for European industry is at risk. Natural gas cannot replace oil as main energy source, once the latter is depleted. From this, the following main conclusions are derived: • The European economy is increasingly dependent on resource imports from other world regions. • Scarcity of ‘Critical metals’ will affect the European economy more subtle, but furtherreaching. High-tech industries, in particular the electronic industry, will be affected by deWuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation iv clining availability of precious metals. Also the development of new eco-technologies, such as photovoltaic electricity generation, could be slowed down by resource scarcity. • It can be expected that worldwide competition for these resources will significantly increase in the near future, potentially leading to serious conflicts related to the access to resource reserves. • In order to deal with this increased scarcity of natural resources, a significant reduction of the worldwide resource use will be necessary. Chapter 3 gives a definition of eco-innovation as well as an overview of different types of eco-innovation and deals with measurement issues. Furthermore, it illustrates selected ecoinnovations in key areas, and highlights also trends, drivers and barriers analysed for these examples and illustrated by fishbone diagrams. The scrutinised eco-innovations and the regarding key conclusions are (1) In the area of housing a. “Deep Renovation”, which enables a minimisation of negative impacts on environment and health by system design and choice of components and is possible in nearly every building, though standardisation is limited, and b. “Smart Metering”, for which there is worldwide evidence that giving consumers appropriate, relevant information on their energy and water use is an important basis for additional measures leading to a reduction in this use and thus in GHG emissions. (2) In the area of mobility a. the “Green Electric Car” and b. “Car sharing”; (3) In the area of food and drink (a) the “Community Supported Agriculture” (CSA) and (b) “Sustainable Sourcing of Retailers”. The chapter concludes that eco-innovation has a crucial role to play in putting the EU on the path to a resource and energy efficient economy and thus significantly reducing the environmental impacts in each of the areas, housing, mobility and food and drink. Experts estimate that this is likely to become an $ 800 billion market worldwide by 2015 and a $ trillion market afterwards. Overcoming the barriers and building up eco-industries for energy and resource efficiency however calls for an active European Union. It requires the engagement of many different actors in society, and strategies should be implemented from many different sides. For an ecoinnovation to be fully accepted and diffused into wider society, a concerted effort must be made to engage people and target the emotional and psychological aspects required to reinforce its uptake. Chapter 4 (How to speed up eco-innovation in the EU) undertakes an attempt to analyse existing EU policies and initiatives; selected member states’ efforts are also considered. This is done via a comparative methodology with a joint format. The annex to this study contains three further briefing notes on this issue written by other authors. The following policies, initiatives and instruments are considered in this study: • The Eco-design Directive (2005 / 32 /EU) – focuses on energy use for a number of products and neglects other environmental dimensions, functional innovation and system innovation are not yet covered; Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation v • The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) – first experience suggests a bias in favour of recycling technologies and energy along existing technology trajectories, less visibility of resource efficiency and new pathways; • The Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP 7); • The Environmental Technology Action Plan (ETAP) – Despite many achievements, environmental technologies still remain a niche market; further green procurement, greater financial investments, the establishment of technology verification and performance targets systems, and focussing on sectors with high gains is needed; • The Directive on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD) – good ambitions, but a lack of implementation in many Member states, implementation requires both a speeding up and a scaling up, addressing the resource efficiency of buildings is desirable; • The European Union Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy • The European Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) • The UK Aggregates Levy and Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF) • Environment-driven Business Development in Sweden • The European Union Energy Label. The analysis identifies specific gaps in the areas of entrepreneurship, pre-commercialisation and mass market development; in addition, the opportunities to refurbish buildings in Europe have not fully been deployed yet (see Figure 1). Based on this and supported by an expert workshop conducted by the ITRE on 12 November 08, the study formulates proposals that could support the EU to speed up eco-innovation. They promote market-based incentives and the reform of existing initiatives; in addition, new proposals are presented that address specific gaps in the areas of entrepreneurship, pre-commercialisation as well as the opportunities to refurbish buildings in Europe. Bearing in mind the importance of construction as a driving forces of resource use, the relevance of the construction industry in the EU Lead market Strategy and current deficits, and the overall success of market-based instruments, this study proposes to extend the existing eco-tax base in Europe by establishing a minimum tax directive on construction minerals. It is expected to drive up eco-innovation because it gives incentives to improve resource efficiency and to refurbish old buildings. In addition, it generates revenues, which can be utilized for specific eco-innovation programmes. A greening of the EU budget would be the material basis for speeding up eco-innovation beyond 2009. This would have to follow two strategic lines: on the one hand unsustainable spending would have to be cut, on the other hand the money saved by this activity could be shifted to support investments in structural eco-innovation. A <b>budgetary</b> <b>strategy</b> could include the following elements: • Further redirecting CAP from direct payments towards integrated rural development schemes, which support eco-innovation in the area of sustainable production of highquality food and biomass. These integrated rural development schemes should include integrated logistical, economic and technological strategies for adapted sustainable natural resource management in the landscape (food, water, soil, biodiversity and closed-loop biomass production and use). These strategies would have to be highly adapted to local economies and landscape conditions thus inducing local eco-innovation and employment schemes. Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation vi • Rigorous environmental appraisal and reduction of Regional Policy schemes for large infrastructure projects which could support long-term unsustainable development paths, shifting towards funding for eco-innovation e. g. in the area of decentralized electricity grids (supporting green electric cars and renewable energies) and lighthouse projects on resource efficient construction and resource recovery. • Redirection of Regional Funds from end-of-pipe technologies towards integrated solutions and eco-innovation (e. g. decentralized water treatment) • More advanced schemes for improving energy and material productivity of economies would require an implementation of the CREST guidelines for improved coordination between Structural Funds, the Research Framework Program and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP). Only such a concentration of forces could achieve a measurable improvement of resource productivity in Europe by means of regional eco-innovation clusters and a European network of regional resource efficiency agencies. • Integration spending of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for improved cofinancing of eco-innovation Figure 1 : Gaps of current EU programmes on eco-innovation Engaging industry in developing eco innovation for sustainable ways of living is considered to be essential. The study identifies six strategy areas where industry can act: 1. Strategy Area 1 : Creating and satisfying demand for green and fair products 2. Strategy Area 2 : Communicating for low impact product use 3. Strategy Area 3 : Innovative after sales services 4. Strategy Area 4 : Product and service innovations Wuppertal Institute et al. Eco-Innovation vii 5. Strategy Area 5 : Service-oriented business models 6. Strategy Area 6 : Leadership for social change and socially responsible business The study formulates proposals to strengthen the SCP Action Plan accordingly, with a special focus on a framework for smarter consumption and leaner production. green public procurement and international processes. Following the gaps identified above, the study also proposes to establish three new initiatives: • A European Trust Funds for Eco-Entrepreneurship, intended to support system innovation driven by new companies; • A Technology Platform for Resource-light industries, intended to develop new markets for European manufacturing industries; • A Programme to foster energy and resource efficiency in the building sector, intended to foster • The deployment of existing opportunities in that area. Finally, a few thoughts are given to the international dimension of eco-innovation and a possible vision of an eco-innovative Europe. ...|$|E

40|$|The Russian federal {{government}} has recently initiated a fundamental reform of its budget system, encompassing important policy, procedural, and institutional changes. This paper reviews this reform agenda {{with reference to the}} experience of industrial countries that over the past two to three decades have followed a similar reform path toward a more devolved budget management system. From this perspective, the importance of the strength of existing public expenditure management systems to accommodate increased devolution and the scope for employing decentralized agencies is explored. An assessment of the present Russian reform plans in light of this review reveals a number of concerns. First, the speed of the reforms contemplated appears overly ambitious when judged by the experience of other countries. Second, the preparedness of budget institutions is questionable. Third, change management capacity needs strengthening with a more carefully defined strategy. Last, in light of these concerns, it is argued that the scope and "big-bang" approach of the current reform plans may need reformulation into a more sequenced strategy with clearer reform priorities.

40|$|This study reviews, {{from both}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical perspective, the links between composition and quality of public finances, on the one hand, and long-term economic growth, on the other, focusing on the EU- 15 countries. Specifically, for a given level of the general government balance, factors such us the composition of revenues and expenditures, an efficient use of public resources or even the public sector size may condition long-term growth insofar as they affect the allocation of resources. On the expenditure side, the available empirical evidence suggests that resources devoted to public investment on transport and communication infrastructures entail positive spillovers on the accumulation of physical capital and the productivity thereof. Moreover, expenditure on education is deemed to increase human capital and labour productivity. Conversely, as far as other R&D and health-care expenditure items are concerned, despite the theoretical arguments supporting their beneficial effects of on long-term growth, the evidence is less conclusive. In turn, public expenditure has to be financed by tax revenues, which {{on the other hand}} are also set to achieve other important goals such as income redistribution or macroeconomic stabilisation. However, taxes may involve a negative impact on economic efficiency by distorting agents’ decisions. Nevertheless, from a theoretical point of view, the complexity of the analysis of the final incidence of the tax burden hampers a proper assessment {{of the effects of the}} different tax categories on economic growth. Finally, the more efficient fiscal policy is, the higher the stimulus on economic growth will be. This advocates for the implementation of budgetary techniques aimed at the fulfilment of the targets set by the general government at the lowest cost possible, notably budgeting according to the results obtained, cost-benefit analysis or medium-term <b>budgetary</b> <b>strategies.</b> However, the implementation of such mechanisms has yielded only moderately satisfactory results, suggesting the need for further improvements. In particular, available analytical tools for the measurement of the efficiency of fiscal policies, in terms of the achievement of given targets at the lowest cost possible, are not accurate enough. Therefore, further progress in this area is a priority. economic growth, quality of public finances, efficiency, crecimiento económico, calidad de las finanzas públicas, eficiencia...|$|R

In particular, this {{study focused on}} rural county budgeting, {{with an emphasis on}} the implementation of user fees. This research area has not been frequently studied prior to this. A mixed methods approach was used in this study. Census of Government data from 1977 through 2002 was used for the quantitative portion. Only counties with a population less than 50, 000 were examined for this study. Counties with a population less than 20, 000 were also broken out and examined as a subpopulation for analysis. Specific emphasis was placed on whether user fees increased over time, if they increased when other traditional forms of revenue decreased, in response to fiscal stress, etc. In addition, case studies were performed on six rural counties to further explore their user fee implementation and responses to fiscal stress. Fiscal stress was found to be endemic among rural counties. The rural counties' quantitative data exhibited large amounts of variation for both the rural population as a whole, as well as the subpopulation studied. A strong correlation was found between the following variables: total revenue and total expenditure; total revenue own sources and total expenditures; total revenue own sources and property tax; total expenditure and property tax; and total revenue own sources and user fees. A medium to weak correlation was found between the following variables: total expenditure and user fees; property tax and user fees; total intergovernmental revenue and user fees; total intergovernmental revenue and total revenue own sources. No correlation was found between fiscal stress and property tax or between fiscal stress and user fees. The counties selected for the case studies were in different states, from multiple geographical regions in the United States and had varying political affiliations. Despite these differences, the case studies yielded some significant similarities across the rural counties studied. The counties had lower levels of educational attainment, high levels of poverty and unemployment. They dealt with these challenges with differing fiscal and <b>budgetary</b> <b>strategies.</b> Both case study and quantitative data yielded substantial variation.

40|$|The {{restructuring}} {{of local government}} finance in Britain is increasingly being viewed as {{part and parcel of}} a broader transformation in the capacity for local welfare provision and scope of local governance. The ways in which local authority <b>budgetary</b> processes and <b>strategies</b> have been affected by these changes are examined. It is suggested that, despite strong elements of continuity, significant new developments in local budgeting behaviour are emerging. However, such changes are not universal. The paper incorporates a comparative case study analysis of two local authorities in central southern England in order to illustrate the geographically uneven way in which local circumstances have mediated the experiences of and reactions to increasing fiscal austerity. ...|$|R

This research also examines the procedural justice and organizational commitment as the mediation variables on the relationship between budgetary participation and village development performance. The results of this study are expected to provide recommendations to the local government about the appropriate <b>budgetary</b> participation <b>strategy</b> for refining and improving village development performance. This research is an explanatory research. The data was collected by survey method. This study was conducted in 14 villages in Jayapura Papua province. The respondents are representing each village which consists of cultural leaders, religious leaders, youth leaders, and female leaders, village-heads and secretaries, and also the a companion program PNPM-Respek. The reliable data processed in this study consist of 97 respondents. Analytical methods to test the hypothesis used Generalized Structured Component Analysis. The results show that budgetary participation does not significantly influence the village development performance; yet, procedural justice and organizational commitment are perfect mediations for the relationship between budgetary participation and village development performance. Organizational commitment is also a perfect mediation for the relationship between procedural justice and village development performance. Procedural justice has a greater role tha...|$|R

It covers the <b>budgetary</b> roles and <b>strategies</b> used in the DOA, Office of Management and Budget, and Congressional appropriation committees. The database used was supplied by the DOA and contains agency initial budget requests and appropriation data from 1980 to 1990.

The study found that during periods of fiscal restraint, the most assertive agencies were the most successful. However, with the support of clientele groups and legislative branch members, agencies requesting moderate increases as well as decreases experienced significant growth in their funding levels and restoral of budget cuts made earlier.

40|$|There {{is a broad}} {{consensus}} among economists that the increased interdependence that comes from sharing a common currency and a single monetary policy justifies some degree of economic policy coordination between euro area Member States. However, empirical studies have, thus far, offered inconclusive evidence regarding the comparative importance {{of different types of}} economic spillover. Accordingly, estimates of the welfare gains from economic policy coordination in the euro area have varied considerably. This study presents original research on the nature of economic interdependence under European Economic and Monetary Union. Its main contribution is to provide plausible estimates of the sign and size of economic spillover in the euro area and the welfare gains from economic policy coordination. These results are relevant for the European Commission's ongoing work on strengthening economic governance {{in the context of the}} Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon <b>Strategy.</b> <b>budgetary</b> spillover, economic interdependence, Stability and Growth Pact, Lisbon Strategy, Haber, van Aarle, Schoors,Gobbin, Claeys...|$|R
40|$|Current {{financial}} turbulence and uncertainty in Europe reinforce arguments {{in favour of}} encouraging economic and monetary cooperation but, at the same time, make such cooperation more difficult. Since the rejection by Denmark of the Maastricht Treaty, five Community currencies (those of Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom) have devalued, two of them have left the system (United Kingdom and Italy) and others have come under serious pressure (Denmark and France). The difficulties cannot be ignored. An {{important component of the}} problem is the management and control of public expenditure. Adjustments to monetary parameters are necessary to solve urgent problems, but they are not sufficient to build a solid EMU. Excessive use of monetary instruments, with persistent budgetary deficits, {{is one of the main}} reasons for the current crisis. Long-lasting financial-market stability requires budgetary discipline. Serious movement towards EMU cannot take place successfully until the budgetary performance of Member States has converged. The European Monetary Union will function properly when Member States accept and work under nominal convergence requirements, among other things, conditions on inflation, interest rates, etc., which means having similar levels of budget deficits. Externalities and interdependence form the basis of the following important arguments identified in support of fiscal cohesion in the European Community: the need for a global European fiscal policy beyond the aggregation of 12 individually decided budgetary positions; the need to avoid the disproportionate use of Community savings by one Member State; a possible bias towards lack of fiscal restraint'; and the need for convergence in budgetary positions during the transition period (A. Lamfalussy, 1989, p. 91). Although the need for fiscal coordination and for controlling national spending in particular have been widely justified, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying and analyzing concrete measures to make this feasible. Most studies on these aspects of the Economic Monetary Union have been concerned with questions as to why the need exist for fiscal convergence and to what degree is it desirable. Attention has only recently been focused on examining what budgetary measures (rules, procedures, structures) can be taken by the Commission or finance ministries for European convergence. This last question was EIPA's main global concern when organizing the workshop Can Norms and Rules enable EC Member States to Secure Budgetary Convergence?' in December 1992. In this workshop, a mixed group of academics and experienced practitioners from the 12 Member States and the Commission met to analyze and discuss the above question and also the general consequences on national budgeting as a result of the conditions put forward by a future European Monetary Union. Presentations and discussions were multidisciplinary. Most of the relevant scientific approaches were represented: public economics, political science, public management and law. A special participant in this workshop was Professor Wildavsky, a visiting professor at EIPA at that time. The objective of the workshop was to analyze, discuss and suggest alternative policy-option initiatives at EC and national levels encouraging convergent financial management behaviour. Discussions were based on the following important questions: What is the current capacity of EC and national governments to manage public spending?'; What <b>budgetary</b> <b>strategies</b> are available to reduce deficits?'; How do social values and political culture affect spending patterns?'; What should the role of the Commission be under these circumstances?'; What is the Member States' responsibility for managing national budgets?'; What budgetary norms and rules should be proposed and negotiated to guarantee convergence of integration?'; What other orders of control should be applied and by whom?' and What strategic and structural arrangements could facilitate integration?'...|$|R
40|$|Public {{spending}} {{is a key}} component for both public finances and government financial policy. In this situation, government expenditures are made in direct relation {{with the results of}} governance with economic and financial crises and global social welfare of the nation. From this perspective, our article aims to highlight the correlation between public expenditure and budgetary financial and economic crisis and, also, state government responses, anticipating their impact on medium and long term. Also, {{in the context of the}} crisis and the concomitent lack of public revenue, we identify the pillars on which to base the budget reduction in public expenditure. The implications of the economic crisis in Romania are analyzed along with proposed measures to be followed by the Government through <b>budgetary</b> fiscal <b>strategy.</b> In relation to the purpose and objectives of the research, documentation was made both in terms of bibliographic resources and the plan of legislative documents and quantitative reporting. We believe that the issue of increasing allocative efficiency of resources is vital to counter the current crisis, but also to maximize the positive effects of public interventions in general and from another state, we consider that state and, consequently, public expenditure budget which should be used to replace the market, can not be regarded as some suggest to be founded and we suggest a line for developed countries.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how Pennsylvania public school districts decide to offer full-day or half- day kindergarten {{and the effects}} of related state policies on decision-making. All 499 of Pennsylvania‟s superintendents from school districts that offer kindergarten received survey invitations, and 162 leaders from Pennsylvania‟s public schools completed a survey that focused on how districts‟ decided to provide full- or half-day kindergarten for the 2014 - 2015 school year, the influence of funding specifically, {{and the effects of}} Pennsylvania‟s compulsory school age. The researcher also analyzed kindergarten enrollment from 2003 to the present, specifically examining the change in kindergarten program type with respect to the overall socioeconomic status (SES) of students served, in relation to the availability of Accountability Block Grant funds, which were commonly have been used to create and sustain full-day kindergarten programs. Money was an important factor in decision-making among school districts planning to offer full-day kindergarten and those planning to offer half-day kindergarten. A lack of available funds was a chief factor in most school districts‟ decision to offer half-day kindergarten, although this was less so for school districts in the highest SES categories. School districts offering full-day kindergarten indicated multiple important factors in their decision, most commonly indicating factors supporting academic outcomes for students who attend full-day programs. The availability of money was also an important factor among participants who indicated that their school districts intended to offer full-day kindergarten for the coming year, and participants indicated ways that their districts ensured the availability of funds through <b>budgetary</b> reduction <b>strategies.</b> The compulsory schooling age had nearly no influence on school districts‟ decision-making or on student enrollment in kindergarten.

The database is a report generated by NAVCOMPT, "Department of the Navy; Operations and Maintenance, Navy (0 &M,N); Review of the FY 1987 Budget. " The analysis of the data supplied by NAVCOMPT suggests a plethora of findings on DON budgetary behavior. These include: claimants which request more funds receive more funds; changes in a claimant's budget request by NAVCOMPT are not final; NAVCOMPT frequently restores funds it has cut; NAVCOMPT is just as likely to add to a budget request as to subtract from the request; the OSD/OMB review has a definite cutting bias; the best predictor of a claimant's budget this year is last year's budget; and claimants do not maintain their proportional share of incremental budget changes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the importance of the roles of management control systems in creating competitive advantage and present a framework for its measurement. A literature review was conducted on management control systems, competitive <b>strategy,</b> <b>budgetary</b> control systems and competitive advantage. Various components of management control systems were explored. Based on the insights gained, a conceptual framework for the measurement of the roles of management control systems in creating competitive advantage is presented. The paper presents a conceptual framework of competitive advantage using management control systems. The development of a framework for assessing the roles of management control in creating competitive advantage is an attempt to contribute to a relatively less explored area. This research is expected to motivate researchers to work in this area. This framework will be beneficial to researchers and practicing managers in identification of opportunities for improvements in management control systems and gaining and sustaining competitive advantage. This paper explores research in a less explored area and offers a framework to help researchers and practitioners in providing a direction for creating and sustaining competitive advantage. management control systems; MCS; competitive advantage; budgetary control systems; BCS; competitive strategy; literature review. ...|$|R
