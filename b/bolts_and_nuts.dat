2500|$|Pre-industrial {{machinery}} {{was built}} by various craftsmen – millwrights built water and wind mills, carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. [...] As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common. [...] Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts.</b> There was also the need for precision in making parts. [...] Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|E
60|$|We made camp {{early that}} day, and, {{because of the}} {{programme}} to stay a week, {{there was a general}} overhauling of soiled clothes by the women, who planned to start washing on the morrow. Everybody worked till nightfall. While some of the men mended harness others repaired the frames and ironwork of the wagons. Them was much heating and hammering of iron and tightening of <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts.</b> And I remember coming upon Laban, sitting cross-legged {{in the shade of a}} wagon and sewing away till nightfall on a new pair of moccasins. He was the only man in our train who wore moccasins and buckskin, and I have an impression that he had not belonged to our company when it left Arkansas. Also, he had neither wife, nor family, nor wagon of his own. All he possessed was his horse, his rifle, the clothes he stood up in, and a couple of blankets that were hauled in the Mason wagon.|$|E

60|$|The {{possibility}} of anything happening to Captain Jan, and my light getting blown out occurred to me, but I said nothing. When we had walked {{a quarter of}} a mile in this level, we came to the point where it entered the pump-shaft. The shaft itself was narrow--about 8 or 10 feet in diameter--but everything in it was ponderous and gigantic. The engine that drove the pump was 70 horse power; the pump-rod was a succession of wooden beams, each like the ridge-pole of a house, jointed together--a rugged affair, with iron <b>bolts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts,</b> and projections at the joints. In this shaft the kibbles were worked. These kibbles are iron buckets by which ore is conveyed to the surface. Two are worked together by a chain--one going up full while the other comes down empty. Both are free to clatter about the shaft and bang against each other in passing, but they are prevented from damaging the pump-rod by a wooden partition. Between this partition and the pump was the ladder we had now to descend, with just space for a man to pass.|$|E
6000|$|The fitting shed at {{that time}} {{contained}} several engines {{in various stages of}} advancement. In one place men were engaged in fitting together the iron framework or foundation of a locomotive, with screws, and <b>bolts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts,</b> and rivets. Others were employed near them, on an engine more advanced, in putting on the wheels and placing the boilers and fire-boxes, while another gang were busy covering the boiler of a third engine with a coating of wood and felt, literally for the purpose of keeping it warm, or preventing its heat from escaping. Farther on, three beautiful new engines, that had just been made and stood ready for action, were receiving a few finishing touches from the painters. Fresh, spotless, and glittering, these were to make their debut on the morrow, and commence their comparatively brief career of furious activity--gay things, doomed emphatically to a fast life! Beyond these young creatures lay a number of aged and crippled engines, all more or less disabled and sent there for repair; one to have a burst steam-pipe removed and replaced, another to have a wheel, or a fire-box or a cylinder changed; and one, that {{looked as if it had}} recently [...] "run a-muck" [...] against all the other engines on the line, stood sulkily grim in a corner, evidently awaiting its sentence of condemnation,--the usual fate of such engines being to be torn, bored, battered, chiselled, clipt, and otherwise cut to pieces, and cast into the furnaces.|$|E

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip zinc coating and looks good when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip zinc coating is that for <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> of size M10 (US 3/8") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating fills in {{too much of the}} threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together). This means that for cars, bicycles, and many other light mechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> is not hot-dip zinc coating, but making the fasteners from stainless steel.|$|E
