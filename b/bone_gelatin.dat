40|$|Gelatin {{is widely}} used in the food {{industry}} as a stabilizer, thickener, emulsifiers, forming gels, water binding, precipitants, and edible coating. The various use of gelatin is not balanced by the growth of domestic production of gelatin.

However, these sources become a problem for people who are forbidden to consume so it is necessary to find alternative sources accepted by all people.

A direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement yielded radiocarbon concentrations of ~ 0. 5 pMC (~ 42 kyr) for the polyethersulfone, ~ 14. 4 – 17. 5 pMC (~ 15. 6 – 14 kyr) for the cellulose, and ~ 107. 4 pMC for the glycerin.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} gelatin {{manufacturer}} is to partial hydrolyze the covalent cross-linkages that {{organize the}} collagen molecules into a quarter staggered arrangement found in connective tissue, to minimize the hydrolysis of the peptide bonds and to obtain the appropriate molecular weigh distribution (MWD) for a specific application. The mechanical properties of the resulting gelatin {{are known to be}} influenced by the tissues and species from which it is produced as well as the pretreatment and extraction procedures. Cold water fish gelatins from saithe (Pollachius virens) skins were in this work extracted at different temperatures, by different acetic acid concentrations and in different extraction times. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS), small-strain oscillatory measurements and optical rotation measurements were used to characterize the resulting gelatins according to their molecular weight, mechanical and structural properties. Saithe gelatins with high weight average molecular weight (M w) and excellent gel forming properties were produced during the extractions made at low temperature while highly hydrolyzed gelatins with reduced mechanical properties were extracted under harsher conditions. Gelatins from cold water fish species, acid porcine skin gelatins (type A) and lime bovine <b>bone</b> <b>gelatins</b> (type B) were compared on the basis of low deformation mechanical properties, Bloom value, M w, MWD and polydispersity index (PI). The Bloom value and dynamic storage modulus (G') for all types of gelatin increased with increasing M w. Cold water fish gelatins and mammalian gelatins exhibit comparable Bloom values at different M w and different PI. The Bloom values for gelatins extracted at room temperature (22 C) from haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe and cod (Gadus morhua) were determined to be 200, 150 and 100 g from a linear correlation between G' and Bloom. Acid porcine skin gelatins and lime bovine <b>bone</b> <b>gelatins</b> with similar M w exhibited different G' and Bloom values, most likely due to varying MWD and PI. Removing low molecular weight (LMW) molecules from a gelatin sample improved the mechanical properties whereas adding LMW gelatin molecules had the opposite effect on the mechanical properties of the resulting gel. Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR), two linear relationships between the mechanical properties and the MWD were suggested. Both the G' value for cold water fish gelatin and the Bloom value for mammalian gelatin were positively correlated with their corresponding fractions of β - chains and high molecular weight (HMW) molecules and negatively correlated with the fractions of LMW molecules. In contrast to the Bloom value for mammalian gelatin, the G' value for cold water fish gelatin was negatively correlated with the fractions of α - chains. PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Postero-lateral lumbar fusion in {{a rabbit}} model was {{performed}} to compare the bone induction potential of autograft, insoluble <b>bone</b> <b>gelatin</b> (ISBG), osteogenic protein- 1 (OP- 1), and the combination of ISBG and OP- 1. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of ISBG as a carrier/enhancer for OP- 1 in a rabbit spinal fusion model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: OP- 1 or recombinant human BMP- 7 {{has been shown to}} be effective in inducing new bone formation in surgical applications such as spinal arthrodesis. However, the lack of an ideal carrier contributes to its associated comorbidities (e. g., uncontrolled bone growth, local inflammatory over-response, nonfusion) and limits its use clinically. METHODS: Adult New Zealand white rabbits (n = 32) underwent bilateral lumbar intertransverse process fusion procedures at L 5 to L 6 and were randomized to receive: (1) autograft; (2) ISBG; (3) OP- 1; or (4) ISBG in combination with OP- 1 (ISBG + OP- 1). Spinal fusion masses were evaluated by manual palpation, biomechanical testing, radiographic assessment, microcomputer tomography scanning and histologic examination at 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Treatment of ISBG + OP- 1 resulted in higher spinal fusion rates (7 of 7, 100 %) than that of autograft (3 of 7, 43 %), ISBG (2 of 8, 25 %), and OP- 1 (2 of 7, 29 %) based on manual palpation (P > 0. 01). Greater fusion rates in the ISBG + OP- 1 group were also evidenced by radiographic examination (P > 0. 01), microcomputer tomography bone volume analysis (P > 0. 01), and biomechanical testing (P > 0. 05). Histologic assessment demonstrated that treatment of ISBG + OP- 1 induces new contiguous bone formation in the interval between the transverse processes which was absent in the other groups. CONCLUSION: In this study, ISBG + OP- 1 resulted in more effective lumbar intertransverse process fusion than autograft, OP- 1 putty or ISBG alone.

40|$|A {{consensus}} has {{not been}} reached on the validity of "old" (pre-Polynesian settlement) C- 14 ages for Pacific rat bones from New Zealand. As an independent test of their validity, we have applied optical dating techniques to fossiliferous sediments at three non-archaeological sites in the North and South Islands. In this paper, we report the optical ages obtained from quartz grains and compare them with a suite of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C- 14 ages obtained from the <b>bone</b> <b>gelatin</b> of Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) and five species of bird (four herbivores and one omnivore). An AMS C- 14 age is also reported for one sample of moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) eggshell. All dated fossil remains were collected from known stratigraphic positions. Additional chronological control is provided by two known-age volcanic tephras at the Hukanui sites in the North Island. At the South Island site (Earthquakes # 1), an infilled burrow provides independent age control, in that fossils inside the burrow should yield younger ages than the sediments and fossils outside the burrow. Bone preservation is uniformly good at all sites, as shown by surface detail, nitrogen content, and C:N ratios. In addition, amino acid profiles {{are consistent with those}} of collagen from modem Pacific rats and the laboratory rat collagen standard. Single-aliquot optical dating protocols were employed to avoid age overestimation due to incomplete bleaching of sediments before burial and to permit the identification of any post-depositional disturbance. At the Hukanui sites, C- 14 ages on bird bone and eggshell agree with the optical ages for the enclosing sediments, and both chronologies are consistent with the accepted ages for the overlying Taupo Ignimbrite (c. 1850 yr BP) and the underlying Waimihia Tephra (c. 3300 yr BP). Two C- 14 ages from Finsch's duck (Chenonetta finschi) bones excavated from within the Taupo Ignimbrite agree with the accepted age of the ignimbrite. In addition, a gelatin sample from a Pacific rat bone reportedly excavated from beneath the Taupo Ignimbrite has a similar amino acid profile to that of modem collagen. This measure of good bone preservation provides confidence in the C- 14 age for this sample (1775 +/- 93 yr BP), which accords with its position beneath the ignimbrite.

40|$|ABSTRACT.

40|$|Abstract. The {{scope of}} this study was to {{fabricate}} and evaluate a novel integrated annulus fibrosus-nucleus pulposus scaffold composed of <b>bone</b> matrix <b>gelatin</b> (BMG) and cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) respectively. Scaffolds were fabricated by a serial physicochemical and free-drying process. The physiochemical property and compatibility of the composite scaffold with intervertebral disc cells were evaluated. HE staining showed no residual cells in both annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus scaffolds. SEM observation revealed that the integration of annulus fibrosus region and nucleus pulposus region was well. The pore diameter of annulus fibrosus scaffold is about 401. 4 ± 13. 1 µm and the nucleus pulposus scaffold 112. 4 ± 21. 8 µm, which demonstrated that the composite scaffolds possess interconnected pores structure. The average compressive elastic modulus of the integrated scaffold was 49. 06 ± 15. 57 kpa, which was lower than that of porcine coccyx intervertebral disc, 135. 9 ± 28. 9 kPa. SEM observation and LIVE/DEAD staining showed good adhesion and high viability of intervertebral disc cells in the integrated scaffold. In conclusion, the integrated annulus fibrosus-nucleus pulposus scaffold can be used for intervertebral disc tissue engineering because of its non-immunogenicity, preservation of ECM composition, good physicochemical property and high biocompatibility with interbertebral disc cells...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{constructed}} tissue-engineered cartilage using allogeneic cancellous <b>bone</b> matrix <b>gelatin</b> (BMG) as a scaffold. Allogeneic BMG {{was prepared}} by sequential defatting, demineralization and denaturation. Isolated rabbit chondrocytes were seeded onto allogeneic cancellous BMG, and cell–BMG constructs were harvested after 1, 3 and 6 weeks for evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin staining for overall morphology, toluidine blue for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans, immunohistochemical staining for collagen type II and a {{transmission electron microscope}} for examining cellular microstructure on BMG. The prepared BMG was highly porous with mechanical strength adjustable by duration of demineralization and was easily trimmed for tissue repair. Cancellous BMG showed favorable porosity for cell habitation and metabolism material exchange with larger pore sizes (100 – 500 µm) than in cortical BMG (5 – 15 µm), allowing cell penetration. Cancellous BMG also showed good biocompatibility, which supported chondrocyte proliferation and sustained their differentiated phenotype in culture for up to 6 weeks. Rich and evenly distributed cartilage ECM proteoglycans and collagen type II were observed around chondrocytes {{on the surface and}} inside the pores throughout the cancellous BMG. Considering the large supply of banked bone allografts and relatively convenient preparation, our study suggests that allogeneic cancellous BMG is a promising scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural process}} of endochondral bone {{formation}} in the growing skeletal system is increasingly inspiring the field of bone tissue engineering. However, {{in order to create}} relevant-size bone grafts, a cell carrier is required that ensures a high diffusion rate and facilitates matrix formation, balanced by its degradation. Therefore, we set out to engineer endochondral <b>bone</b> in <b>gelatin</b> methacrylamide (GelMA) hydrogels with embedded multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) and cartilage-derived matrix (CDM) particles. CDM particles were found to stimulate the formation of a cartilage template by MSCs in the GelMA hydrogel in vitro. In a subcutaneous rat model, this template was subsequently remodeled into mineralized bone tissue, including bone-marrow cavities. The GelMA was almost fully degraded during this process. There {{was no significant difference in}} the degree of calcification in GelMA with or without CDM particles: 42. 5 +/- 2. 5 % vs. 39. 5 +/- 8. 3 % (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively. Interestingly, in an osteochondral setting, the presence of chondrocytes in one half of the constructs fully impeded bone {{formation in the}} other half by MSCs. This work offers a new avenue for the engineering of relevant-size bone grafts, by the formation of endochondral bone within a degradable hydrogel. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Bioactive calcium {{phosphate}} (Ca―P)coated titanium {{is the most}} promising bone replacement materials. Bioactive calciumphosphate (Ca―P) coated titanium has the advantages of both metal and ceramicsand has been considered {{as one of the}} most promising <b>bone</b> replacementmaterials. <b>Gelatin</b> is the denatured form of collagen and is expected to bebeneficial for hard tissue applications. The CaP/gelatin composite coatings couldcombine the bioactivity and osteoconductivity of CaP with the good characteristicsof gelatin. In the present study, The pulsed electrochemicaldeposition method was employed to deposit CaP/gelatin composite coatings ontitanium substrates. The main purpose of the study is to explore the optimumprocessing parameters of the composite coating. Electrolyte was made from themixture of the Ca―P and gelatin aqueous solution with different concentrations. SEM, XRD and FTIR were usedto characterize the composition and morphology of the coating. The coatings prepared underconstant voltage and pulse voltage electrodeposition were compared and it was foundthat the pulse voltage mode was more suitable for preparing CaP/gelatincoatings. The results indicated that Theoptimized experimental conditions were as follows,:pulse voltage range, of 0 to ― 1. 3 V, the Ca 2 + concentrationof 5. 0 &times; 10 ― 4 mol/L; gelatin concentration of, 0. 5 g/L, pH value, of 5. 0; temperature of, 50 ¡æ. Osteoblasts were cultured on the coatings to evaluate the biocompatibilityof coatings. Alamar Blue assay indicated that the composite coatings couldfavor the proliferation of the osteoblasts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} an ideal bone graft, a new bone grafting material was developed using deglued <b>bone,</b> chitosan and <b>gelatin.</b> Deglued <b>bone</b> (DGB) which is a by-product of bone glue industries and has the close crystallographic similarities of hydroxyapatite was used as main component {{in the preparation of}} bone implant. Chitosan was prepared from the exoskeleton of prawn (Pinaeus indicus, family Crustaceae) which is a by-product of seafood industries. Chitosan gives toughness to the product and do not allow the DGB particles to wither away when the implant is placed in the defect. Gelatin was used as binder for the preparation of DGB– chitosan composite. The DGB, chitosan and DGB–chitosan–gelatin composite, which were prepared in the laboratory, were analysed for their physicochemical properties by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} entropy-elastic gelatin based networks {{in the form of}} films or scaffolds. The materials have good prospects for biomedical applications, especially in the context of <b>bone</b> regeneration. Entropy-elastic <b>gelatin</b> based hydrogel films with varying crosslinking densities were prepared with tailored mechanical properties. Gelatin was covalently crosslinked in water above its sol gel transition, which suppressed the gelatin chain helicity. Amorphous films were prepared with tailorable degrees of swelling and wet state Young's modulus. The knowledge gained with this bulk material was transferred to the integrated process of foaming and crosslinking to obtain porous gelatin-based scaffolds. A gelatin solution was foamed in the presence of saponin and the resulting foam was fixed by chemical crosslinking with a diisocyanate. The scaffolds were analyzed in the dry state by micro computed tomography (μ CT, porosity: 65 ± 11 - 73 ± 14 vol. -...|$|R
