5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has <b>been</b> <b>extended,</b> rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was {{the construction of a}} pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} a new limited-access highway through Cattaraugus and Chautauqua {{counties}} (part of the modern Southern Tier Expressway) in the mid-1960s. The initial section of the highway, extending from Kennedy (exit14) to Randolph (exit16), opened to traffic by 1967 and became part of a rerouted NY17 in the late 1960s. By November 1973, the expressway had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> west to Fluvanna (exit11) and east to Steamburg (exit 17). NY17 was then realigned to follow the expressway while its former routing from Jamestown to Steamburg, {{as well as all}} of NY17J, was redesignated as NY394.
