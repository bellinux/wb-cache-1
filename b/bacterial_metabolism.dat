5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>metabolism</b> is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of <b>bacterial</b> <b>metabolism</b> and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E

Thus, a fluidic analysis device has been designed and realised in order to monitor pH-related bacterial activities.

Microcalorimetry has also been developed to investigate biological processes and measure <b>bacterial</b> <b>metabolisms.</b> This measurement is done {{on the basis of}} the heat (produced or consumed) and therefore has a wider range of applicability compared to other methods based on the chemical analyses of substrate consumption or product formation. For this purpose, a 2 L Bio-RC 1 (Mettler-Toledo) has been modified to reach a resolution of 5 – 10 mW L− 1 and applied to research projects on activated sludge characterization.

40|$|The human {{microbiota}} greatly affects {{physiology and}} disease; however, {{the contribution of}} bacteria to the response to chemotherapeutic drugs remains poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans and its bacterial diet provide a powerful system to study host-bacteria interactions. Here, we use this system to study how bacteria affect the C. elegans response to chemotherapeutics. We find that different bacterial species can increase the response to one drug yet decrease the effect of another. We perform genetic screens in two bacterial species using three chemotherapeutic drugs: 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), 5 -fluoro- 22 ̆ 7 -deoxyuridine (FUDR), and camptothecin (CPT). We find numerous <b>bacterial</b> nucleotide <b>metabolism</b> genes that affect drug efficacy in C. elegans.

2500|$|Researchers {{have focused}} on the role of {{melamine}} and related compounds in causing renal failure. Beginning on 19 April, [...] researchers reportedly had ruled out aminopterin contamination and had found a [...] "spoke-like crystal" [...] in contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate and the tissues and urine of affected animals. (It was previously known that melamine and cyanuric acid can form networks of hydrogen bonds, creating a tile-like planar structure through molecular self-assembly.) The crystal has been said to serve as a biomarker for contamination and is approximately 30% melamine. The remainder has been identified as cyanuric acid, ammelide and ammeline, with crystals recovered from urine reported to be approximately 70% cyanuric acid. While some researchers have theorized the three latter chemicals might have been formed as the animals metabolized the melamine, or as byproducts of <b>bacterial</b> <b>metabolism</b> (cyanuric acid is a known intermediate byproduct of <b>bacterial</b> <b>metabolism</b> of melamine), their presence in the crystals found in contaminated protein itself, combined with media reports of widespread adulteration with both melamine and cyanuric acid in China, has focused research efforts on their combined effects in animals. Neither melamine nor cyanuric acid, a chemical commonly used in pool chlorination, have been thought to be particularly toxic by themselves. The current hypothesis is, although these contaminants are not very toxic individually, their potency appears to be increased when they are present together.|$|E

40|$|Culture-independent {{studies have}} shown that {{microbial}} consortia in natural environments are incredibly diverse and are dominated by bacteria and archaea substantially different from microbes maintained in pure laboratory cultures. Recent studies indicate, however, that previous culture-independent studies using PCR-based methods have largely overlook an important group of uncultured bacteria, the Cytophagales. These bacteria appear to be abundant in the oceans and probably other oxic environments. Although well known to be active in degradation of structural glycans such as cellulose and chitin, no cellulase or chitinase gene has been sequenced from a Cytophaga, except those recently found by whole genome sequencing of Cytophaga hutchinsonii by the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI). We hypothesize that the key to understanding consortia and their function in organic matter mineralization in oxic environments is to focus on uncultured Cytophagales, genes encoding endoglycanases, and other functional genes. The ''metagenomic'' approach used by this project consisted of constructing large insert libraries with DNA directly (no PCR) from uncultured microbial consortia found in the Arctic Ocean and Delaware Estuary.

40|$|Sedimentary hopanes are pentacyclic triterpenoids {{that serve}} as {{biomarker}} proxies for bacteria and certain <b>bacterial</b> <b>metabolisms,</b> such as oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic methanotrophy. Their parent molecules, the bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs), have been hypothesized to be the bacterial equivalent of sterols. However, the actual function of BHPs in bacterial cells is poorly understood. Here, we report the physiological study of a mutant in Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE- 1 that is unable to produce any hopanoids. The deletion of the gene encoding the squalene-hopene cyclase protein (Shc), which cyclizes squalene to the basic hopene struc-ture, resulted in a strain that no longer produced any polycyclic triterpenoids. This strain was able to grow chemoheterotrophically, photoheterotrophically, and photoautotrophically, demonstrating that hopanoids are not required for growth under normal conditions. A severe growth defect, as well as significant morphological damage, was observed when cells were grown under acidic and alkaline conditions. Although minimal changes in shc transcript expression were observed under certain conditions of pH shock, {{the total amount of}} hopanoid production was unaffected; however, the abundance of methylated hopanoids significantly increased.

The two bacteria species were sampled in mats from a hypersaline lake. They underwent accelerated ageing by cumulative thermal treatments to induce progressive carbonization {{of the biological}} material, mimicking the natural maturation of carbonaceous material of Archean age. For thermal treatments at temperatures higher than 620 °C, a drastic increase in the EPR linewidth is observed in the carbonaceous matter from oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and not anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria.

For comparison, we carried out an EPR study of organic radicals in silicified carbonaceous rocks (cherts) from various localities, of different ages (0. 42 to 3. 5 Gyr) and having undergone various degrees of metamorphism, i. e. various degrees of natural carbonization. EPR linewidth dispersion for the most primitive samples was quite significant, pointing to a selective dipolar broadening similar to that observed for carbonized bacteria.

Different strategies of biotic control of the fermentative microbial communities were then investigated, confirming the important role of these species and the possibility of using them as biotic controllers of the overall community. Artificial co-cultures were also carried out, and a specific type of interaction was characterized.
