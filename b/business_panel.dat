40|$|Using National Family <b>Business</b> <b>Panel</b> data {{combined}} with national natural disaster and federal disaster assistance data, {{the purpose of}} the study was to investigate relative contributions of human, social and financial capital; natural disaster exposure; and federal disaster assistance to business-owning family resilience over time for male and female family business owners. With a theoretical foundation of Sustainable Family Business and Conservation of Resources theories, the study examined 311 small family firms from the National Family <b>Business</b> <b>Panel.</b> Federal disaster assistance explained a significant amount of variance in firm-owning resilience. Higher levels of federal disaster assistance were associated with lower family firm resilience for male-owned businesses and higher family firm resilience for female-owned businesses. This study advances knowledge of firm sustainability after natural disasters by adding to the conceptualization and measurement of family firm resilience; by having baseline firm financial data prior to disaster exposure; by utilizing a national, representative, longitudinal family firm sample; by including a range of natural disasters and federal disaster assistance; and by including family resilience over time.

The results show that those SMEs that work with fewer financial intermediaries obtain fewer funds for the same increase in the interest rate, which indicates that these companies have more financial restraints.

30|$|This paper adds to this {{literature}} {{by identifying the}} impacts of the Sri Lanka TEWA on firm employment and growth. We exploit two sources of variation in the way firms are treated to identify the policy’s effects. First, the law only applies to firms with more than 14 workers, and so smaller firms need not comply. Second, firms in EPZ do not face the same constraints imposed by the TEWA. These sharp differences in policies applied to firms of different size create several strategic options. Firms that anticipate growing beyond 14 workers will try to sort into the EPZ to avoid the constraints imposed by the law. The cost of growing beyond 14 workers may discourage nonEPZ firms from growing. Furthermore, the costs imposed by the TEWA may {{be large enough to}} drive covered firms out of <b>business.</b> <b>Panel</b> data on the cohort of all firms registering for business in Sri Lanka between 1995 and 2002 is used to provide evidence for all three possibilities.|$|E

The companies included in the study make up the program’s <b>business</b> <b>panel.</b> The four studies focus on: the dynamics of the integration of environmental management in company strategy; the response of marketing functions to environmental pressures and innovations; the influence of stakeholder networks on business responses to environmental issues; the interaction between businesses and environmental authorities. The program involves the development of a meta-theoretical perspective based on organizational learning and change (OLC). The meta-theory draws on recent ideas about the organizational capabilities for OLC that is mediated through the interaction of networks of actors which span focal organizations and their institutional and social fields (Roome and Bergin, 1998).

40|$|T he latest {{release from}} the International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{forecasts}} {{that the size of}} the global economy will have increased by 3. 3 percent by the end of 2014. For 2015, our Kelley School of <b>Business</b> <b>panel</b> is anticipating that the world will experience a slight rebound to 3. 8 percent growth in global gross domestic product (GDP). The global economy will show some strengths and weaknesses in 2015. It is reasonable to state that the eurozone is responsible for the disappointing outcome of global growth in 2014. Europe’s growth was exceptionally weak at only 0. 8 percent. The United States, on the other hand, was the engine of global growth, with very encouraging results in 2014. United States U. S. growth is bouncing back but seems to be stuck below its potential. ȱȱȱȱȱęȱȱȱ 2014 (a 2. 9 percent drop in GDP), the U. S. economy bounced back. This was primarily due to the strengthening real estate market, greater household consumption and increased business spending. Furthermore, the recent pickup of wages, as the labor market tightens, suggests a more sustainable economic recovery for 2015, which we forecast to be slightly above 3 percent. One possible threat to the U. S. ’s stronger recovery is the end of ȱȱȂȱȱ ȱǻřǼȱȱȱęȱ market’s reaction. The reaction of market participants right after the announcement didn’t spark volatility in the stock market indexes, but then they had correctly anticipated the end of the Fed’s massive purchase of Treasuries and asset-backed securities.

40|$|Background Currently, {{little is}} known about workers' {{occupational}} safety and health (OSH) information-seeking behavior. Methods We assessed whether Dutch workers have (OSH) questions, what motivates them to seek information or advice to solve these questions, and whether workers actually find the information they are looking for. A random sample of 888 workers from a large <b>business</b> <b>panel</b> were sent an online questionnaire. In total, 535 workers, likely parallel to the Dutch working population, returned the questionnaire (response rate 60 %). Results In the last year, 380 of the 535 respondents (71 %) had at least one OSH question. In total, 159 of the 380 respondents (42 %) with an OSH question actively searched for information or advice. In a logistic regression analysis, three factors were identified to influence workers' information seeking: cognitions about personal benefits or costs of solving the question (OR 2. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 8 - 4. 5), emotions that accompany the question (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 3. 0), and encouragement by the social environment (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 3. 0). In total, 50 % of the respondents seeking information indicated they could not find (all) the information they sought. The barrier most often mentioned (47 %) was the poor applicability of the information. Conclusions Although most workers have OSH questions, only 40 % seek information or advice to answer their questions. Moreover, many OSH questions remain unanswered by common information facilities. This study provides input on how to develop campaigns and new facilities that may induce workers to seek information and that offer more applicable information. Am. J. Ind. Med. 55 : 250 - 259, 2012.
