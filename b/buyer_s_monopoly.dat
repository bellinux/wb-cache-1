40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{coordination}} of order and production policy between buyers and suppliers in supply chains. When a buyer and a supplier of an item work independently, the buyer will place orders based on his economic order quantity (EOQ). However, the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> EOQ may not lead to an optimal policy for the supplier. It can be shown that a cooperative batching policy can reduce total cost significantly. Should the buyer have the more powerful position to enforce his EOQ on the supplier, then no incentive exists for him to deviate from his EOQ in order to choose a cooperative batching policy. To provide an incentive to order in quantities suitable to the supplier, the supplier could offer a side payment. One critical assumption made throughout in the literature dealing with incentive schemes to influence <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> ordering policy is that the supplier has complete information regarding <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure. However, this assumption is far from realistic. As a consequence, the buyer has no incentive to report truthfully on his cost structure. Moreover there is an incentive to overstate the total relevant cost in order to obtain as high a side payment as possible. This paper provides a bargaining model with asymmetric information about the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure assuming that the buyer has the bargaining power to enforce his EOQ on the supplier in case of a break-down in negotiations. An algorithm for the determination of an optimal set of contracts which are specifically designed for different cost structures of the buyer, assumed by the supplier, will be presented. This algorithm was implemented in a software application, that supports the supplier in determining the optimal set of contracts...|$|R

The model stylizes a buyer-seller relationship but the results apply quite naturally to many contractual situations including regulation and optimal income-taxation. I. rst show, through a simple example, that distortions need not vanish over time and need not be monotonic in the shock to the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation. These results are in contrast to those obtained in the literature that assumes a Markov process with a binary state space. e. g. Battaglini, 2005. I then show that when the sets of possible types in any two adja-cent periods satisfy a certain overlapping condition (which is always satis. ed with a continuum of types), then the dynamics of the optimal mechanism can be signi. cantly simpli. ed by as-suming the shocks are independent over time. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimal mechanism is then the same irrespective of whether the shocks are the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> private informa-tion or are observed also by the seller. These conditions are satis. ed, for example, {{in the case of an}} AR(1) process, a Brownian motion, but also when shocks have a multiplicative e as it is often the case in. nancial applications. Furthermore, the distortions in the optimal quantities are independent of the distributions of the shocks and, when the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation is additively separable, they are also independent of whether the shocks are transitory or permanent. Finally, I show that assuming the shocks are independent not only greatly simpli. es the analysis but is actually without loss of generality with a continuum of types...|$|R

40|$|Major League Baseball, {{alone among}} {{industries}} {{of its size}} in the United States, operates as an unregulated monopoly. This twentieth century regulatory anomaly has become known simply as the 2 ̆ 2 baseball anomaly. 2 ̆ 2 Major League Baseball developed into a major commercial enterprise without being subject to antitrust liability. Long after the interstate commercial character of baseball had been established, and even recognized by the Supreme Court, baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>monopoly</b> remained free from federal regulation. ^ This study explains the baseball anomaly by connecting baseball 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory status to the larger political environment, tracing the game 2 ̆ 7 s fate through four different regulatory regimes in the United States. The constellation of institutional, ideological and political factors within each regulatory regime provides the context for {{the persistence of the}} baseball anomaly. Baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> unregulated <b>monopoly</b> persists because of the confluence of institutional, ideological and political factors which have prevented the repeal of baseball 2 ̆ 7 s antitrust exemption to date. However, both the institutional and ideological factors, which have in the past protected baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> unregulated <b>monopoly,</b> are fading. Baseball 2 ̆ 7 s owners can no longer claim special cultural significance in defense of the exemption, nor can they claim that the commissioner system approximates government regulation sufficiently. Both of these strategies have been discredited by the labor unrest in baseball over the last decade. ^ While baseball is one labor strike away from losing part of its exemption, it will likely retain the aspects of the exemption which cover the contractual relationship between the major and minor leagues, as well as the part of the exemption which allows Major League Baseball to regulate the migration of individual franchises. These aspects of baseball 2 ̆ 7 s exemption with likely be codified and expanded to all professional sports leagues. The eventual partial repeal of baseball 2 ̆ 7 s exemption and the likely expansion of part of baseball 2 ̆ 7 s exemption to other sports makes it both an outdated anomaly and a harbinger of sports antitrust policy in the twenty first century. ...|$|R

Using panel methods, we regress the three production indices on several factors important in explaining productivity changes.

Productivity is also sensitive to relative grain prices, to natural disasters such as flood and drought, and proximity of the provinces to coastal areas. 1.

Second, how are the improvements of water resources management expected to be realized through the Decision of CC 2013 ? From the discussion, the author has two conclusions. First, the negligence of the state caused that {{the role of the state}} in providing drinking water for the citizens was lost by the role of private sector.

The RAC faced the task of creating an organization that could compete not only with illicit English competition, but also with small and large firms from other European nations in the West African commercial environment. This required the transmission of information on African consumer demand across several months and thousands of miles of ocean and its use in assembling cargoes from among several hundred distinct types of European, American, and Asian goods. RAC shareholders in England also had to design systems to monitor and control the behavior of their expatriate managers in Africa. ^ The RAC proved unable to adapt its business practices to the extreme complexity of these connected tasks, making it vulnerable to the commercial and political opposition of its independent English competitors and eventually leading to the final loss of the company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>monopoly</b> over British trade with Africa in 1712.
