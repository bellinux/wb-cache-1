25|$|In 1992, Saved by the Bell {{unexpectedly}} {{received an}} order for an additional eleven episodes to be shot after the graduation episode. However, Thiessen and Berkley had already {{decided to leave the}} show. Though producers knew they couldn't replace Kelly and Jessie, they also knew they couldn't leave Lisa as the only girl on the show. A new character, Tori Scott, was created as a cool <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> biker girl who would also serve as a love interest for Zack and also act as a nemesis for him initially. Leanna Creel was cast for the part. Rather than develop a second new character, the producers decided to rely more on minor recurring characters such as Ginger, Ox, and Big Pete.|$|E

25|$|Three centuries were {{recorded}} at Old Trafford, as Gloucestershire Gladiators snatched {{a victory over}} the hosting Lancashire Lightning after being regarded with no chance earlier on. The Gladiators won the toss and got immediate success, as Jon Lewis dismissed Mal Loye with the second ball of the day, <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> much everything went against Gloucestershire from then on, as Stuart Law, Mark Chilton and Andrew Symonds flayed the bowling to all corners. Symonds took 88 balls for his century, {{and went on to}} make 129 before being bowled by James Averis - who finished with four for 40. Law and Chilton also made fifties, but Averis' late spell and a slow 39-ball 11 from Marcus North ensured that the total ended on 267 for 7. Then, James Anderson had three men caught off his bowling, as Gloucestershire crashed to 47 for 4. However, Anderson finished his spell, and Ramnaresh Sarwan crafted a century - which was shortly followed by Mark Hardinges reaching his first one-day century of his career, and in the process lifting his List A career batting average from 14.23 to 17.50, still below par for a specialist batsman like Hardinges. However, the pair added 221 runs in 116 minutes for the fifth wicket, hitting six sixes along the way, as they guided Gloucestershire out of the relegation zone in the National League.|$|E

500|$|Like other sequels in the Mega Man series, Mega Man 5 has {{suffered}} criticism for {{its lack of}} innovative gameplay and storytelling. GamePro summarized the game as [...] "déjà {{vu all over again}} for disciples of the series" [...] and that [...] "Capcom must get some kind of cash rebate for recycling video games". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish considered Mega Man 5 as [...] "a painfully phoned-in episode lacking not only innovation, <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> much all the polish and balance that made the earlier games so enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E
500|$|Appeal to Reason {{also had}} less {{positive}} reception, with most negative reviews criticizing the band's further movement into the mainstream. Entertainment Weekly criticized the album, saying, [...] "Songs like [...] "Re-Education (Through Labor)" [...] and [...] "Entertainment," [...] {{which seeks to}} redress the evils of media manipulation upon the land, are peppy <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> empty, power-chord downers with little bark or bite." [...] In giving the album five out of ten stars, PopMatters said, [...] "McIlrath rarely reaches beyond his one-note vocal performance despite apparent and commendable earnestness...he never channels the intensity of early-career songs like [...] "Dead Ringer", let alone the intensity of Henry Rollins. The {{other members of the}} band don't fare much better: new lead guitarist Zach Blair, in particular, might have his three-chord attack down to a science, but the formula wears thin by the time the album gets through its first 30 minutes—and after that, there are still 18 to go. And the song writing doesn't get much more imaginative in the disc's final act." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Daniel Roberts of PopMatters said none of {{the songs}} were better than [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and believed Drake was suffering from an [...] "identity crisis", finding the record [...] "good at parts, but never great". Josuha Errett of Now felt Drake [...] "complains about fame way too much" [...] while calling him [...] "humorless". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed Drake [...] "neither thug nor thug wannabe ... plenty talented, <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> shallow and without much focus as a mack". He wrote of the record: [...] "Pleasing and hookful though it be, [...] consistently bemoans the confusing emoluments and accoutrements of fame". Pete Cashmore from NME believed [...] "it's those constant and predictable superstar interjections that prevent the album from standing {{out as much as}} it had potential to do." [...] Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo viewed Drake's [...] "insistent navel-gazing" [...] as a flimsy [...] "concept", but commended the album for [...] "nail confused introspection in a genre famous for willful misrepresentation of self." ...|$|E

500|$|Rise Against's fifth studio album Appeal to Reason was {{released}} on October 4 in Australia, October 6 across Europe, and October 7 in the United States. The album sold 64,700 copies in its first week and peaked at numberthree on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it Rise Against's highest-charting album to date. Appeal to Reason was met with generally positive reviews. However, critics did not rate it as highly as The Sufferer & the Witness, mostly blaming the movement toward the mainstream and away from faster hardcore punk. Giving the album a C+ rating, Marc Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly said the album is filled with [...] "protest anthems that lean closer to the burnished angst of such bands as New Found Glory and Fall Out Boy than the genuine outrage of brainy Green Day" [...] and songs that are [...] "peppy <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> empty, power-chord downers with little bark or bite." [...] Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone stated that the songs on Appeal to Reason [...] "are driven by an ever-sharpening pop sensibility." [...] He also said that [...] "Rise Against may be nervous about leaving the underground behind, but with sharp songs like these, they're ready {{for the rest of}} the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mamluks {{contributed to}} Gazan {{architecture}} by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths. They also allowed Jews {{to return to}} the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller Meshulam of Volterra wrote:Gazza is called by the Moslems Gaza. It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses. They had already begun to make the new wine. ... The Jews live {{at the top of the}} hill. May God exalt them. There are also four Samaritan householders who live on the hillside.|$|E
500|$|Blackwoods actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy {{claimed that}} [...] " [...] doesn't really buy it at first, <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> soon even her cynical {{attitude}} can't ignore {{the truth of}} the situation they're all in." [...] Perry defined the role as [...] "someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." [...] Her casting was assessed by Perry as [...] "full of energy" [...] and [...] "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [...] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't understand why she is the way she is." [...] Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in You, Me and the Kids) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of [...] ) as farmer Brian Gibbons. Novice actors Sarah Carter, Alejandro Rae, and Shaun Sipos were hired as Kimberly's friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly. Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly's father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. <b>But</b> <b>pretty</b> much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E
500|$|Clare Heal of the Daily Express, in her {{review of}} the third series, praised the show's [...] "spot-on spoofs of modern telly" [...] and agreed that [...] "There's no {{particular}} target audience <b>but</b> <b>pretty</b> much anyone of any age will find something in there for them". Kerrie Mills of PopMatters rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show [...] "does also provide evidence, edgewise between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligence... in fact, it might just {{be one of the}} most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." [...] Stephen Kelly of The Guardian argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just [...] "the best show on children's television—it's one of the smartest comedies on TV", performed by an [...] "astonishing cast... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." [...] In an article discussing the League of Gentlemen troupe's appearance in the same series, the Radio Times Gareth McLean agreed that [...] "despite nominally being a children's programme, Horrible Histories is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that [...] "ultimately, comedy performers relish [...] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." [...] Graeme Virtue of The Scotsman called the League's reunion a [...] "coup" [...] for the series: [...] "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained." ...|$|E
