5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E

The temperature dependencies of resistivity and thermopower have been measured. It {{was found that the}} S(T) dependencies take some additional features with Ca content increase. The results obtained have been analyzed {{on the basis of the}} phenomenological theory of electron transport in the case of the narrow conductive band. The main parameters of the band spectrum (the band filling with electrons degree and the total effective band width) have been determined. The dependencies of these from contents of substituting elements are discussed. Analyzing the results obtained simultaneously with the tendencies in oxygen content and critical temperature change we have confirmed the conclusion that the oxygen sublattice disordering has a determinant effect on band structure parameters and superconductive properties of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(y). The results obtained suggest that Ca gives rise to some peculiarities in band spectrum of this compound...|$|R
