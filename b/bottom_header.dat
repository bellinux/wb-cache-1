5000|$|Flat plate {{collectors}} are {{an extension}} of the idea to place a collector in an 'oven'-like box with glass directly facing the Sun. Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors' <b>bottom</b> <b>header,</b> and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the top header. Serpentine flat plate collectors differ slightly from this [...] "harp" [...] design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} support the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, an {{accident}} analysis has been performed for the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) Spallation-Induced Lithium Conversion (SILC) Source. This report presents a lumped-parameter analysis that predicts the thermal response of the source to a large-break LOCA. The accident scenario assumes the break {{to occur in the}} cold leg outside the source basin and the pipe break is immediately followed by the tripping of the proton beam and the activation of the source-basin flood system. The calculations were performed for a ``beyond-design-basis event`` which further assumes the failure of all other active cooling systems, and the failure to establish natural circulation in the unbroken loop. Calculations show that the source rods remain flooded in heavy water until 44 hours after the LOCA. At this time, the source rods begin to be uncovered and at 48 hours into the accident the source rods are completely boiled dry. The average source temperature reaches a maximum value of 303 C at 57 hours. Thereafter, the source rods begin to cool since the heat transfer to the basin water is sufficient to remove all the decay heat from the source. It is estimated that by this time a maximum of 27 % of the lead inventory (6, 558 kg) in the source rods can be expected to melt. This molten material, assuming that it can get out of the aluminum cladding, will fall to the D{sub 2 }O-filled <b>bottom</b> <b>header,</b> quench rapidly, and remain in a coolable state...|$|E

TSAE technique was carried out very carefully by using a mixed solution of ammonium hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid in presence of inhibitor urotropine and cleaning agent OP- 10 (Russia).

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Dimple plate heat {{exchangers}} are {{a new type of}} welded compact plate {{heat exchangers}}. The dimple plates increase the turbulence of the fluid flowing over the plate, increasing the efficiency of the heat exchanger without increasing pressure drop over the heat exchanger. The compact design of the heat exchanger makes it possible to install the heat exchanger at the top of condenser columns, reducing the footprint area of the column by replacing standard shell and tube condensers {{at the foot of the}} column. After the implementation of these condensers in 2008, Sasol experienced failures of 12 column-top dimple plate condensers in unit 300. In these cases damage was observed at the weld between the plates and the <b>bottom</b> <b>header.</b> One possible reason for the damage was vibration caused by the flow over the dimple plates. The characteristics of flow-induced vibrations in dimple {{plate heat exchangers}} were studied in the scientific literature. It was, however, found that although the effect of dimples on channel walls had been wellresearched, the fluid-elastic vibration of the bluff body containing the dimples had not been sufficiently studied. A simple aerodynamic model was constructed to determine the characteristics of the combination of vibration caused by the bluff body (plate) and the flow over the dimples on the plate. The experiment showed the generation of two flow-induced vibration amplitudes. The structure of the heat exchanger was modelled by using mass, stiffness and damping elements. With certain assumptions the model was reduced to a two degrees of freedom system that simulated the most prominent vibration direction. This model was used to simulate the effect of design changes to the response of the structure to a range of forcing frequencies. An experimental model of the column-top condensers was constructed and the response due to different vibration frequencies was measured. The measured results were compared with the theoretically predicted values for cases with the current design and the cases where the vibration-control concept was implemented. This validated the theoretical model and the mathematical simulation as a tool to design vibrationcontrol systems for real heat exchangers. With the replacement of the very stiff mounts that are used in current designs with soft rubber mounts, the dynamic forces on the internal plates was reduced by up to 97. 8 % for certain forcing frequencies. The deflection of the internal plates is a main cause of stress in the plates and, more importantly, the weld fillets connecting the bottom of the plates to a common header. This repeated stress can easily cause fatigue failure in the welds. By therefore reducing the amplitude of vibration of the heat exchangers, the onset of fatigue failure will be substantially delayed, increasing the reliable lifetime of the column-top condenser. This concept is not only limited to dimple plate heat exchangers. The oscillating stress in any internal component can, therefore, be reduced by isolating the whole system with soft rubber mounts of a determined stiffness and layout. Master...|$|E

40|$|A heat {{exchanger}} that arranges flat tubes horizontally has a vertical header that distributes the refrigerant to each tube. When the {{heat exchanger}} {{works as an}} evaporator, differences in flow conditions at each branch, such as the ratio and distribution of vapor and liquid, due to the differences in densities and momentums of vapor and liquid in the two-phase flow make equal distribution difficult. This paper describes the distribution characteristics of a four-branch header that has a rectangular cross-section without the internal protrusion of flat tubes {{in the case of}} the inflow of the refrigerant R 32 from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>header</b> by using an equipment that can estimate the distribution ratio of the liquid and vapor phase to each branch.

40|$|International audienceLiquid flow {{distributions}} {{were measured}} in nine parallel microchannels with inner diameters of 0. 8 mm {{connected to a}} common header, fed by air water flows through a single tube. Flow maldistribution in the microchannels was analyzed considering the combined effects of the two-phase flow characteristics (flow pattern, gas quality, mass fluxes and superficial velocities), microchannel-header arrangements (horizontal or vertical), and microchannel flow and header feeding orientations (horizontal, vertical upward or vertical downward). The header was loaded with two-phase mass fluxes of 72, 144 and 216 kg/m(2) s and the gas quality ranged from 0 to 0. 75. An increase in the flow rate homogeneity was noted for the arrangement horizontal header and horizontal microchannels, when the header was loaded parallel to the microchannels or perpendicularly from the <b>header</b> <b>bottom.</b> Highly heterogenous flow distributions occurred for the arrangement vertical header and horizontal microchannels. Preferential liquid feeding occurred in the microchannels far from the inlet feeding tube for inlet flows with high gas quality (over 10 %) and high gas superficial velocity (over 20 m/s) and with the inlet tube parallel to the microchannels. Preferential liquid feeding occurred in the microchannels close to the inlet feeding tube for inlet flows with a horizontal header and upward flows through the microchannels. The results and conclusions of this study represent {{an important contribution to}} this field, which could enhance the design of evaporators and condensers in compact heat exchangers.

40|$|Blowdon cooling heat {{transfer}} {{is an important}} process that occurs early in a hypothetical large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) in a pressurized water reactor. During blowdown, the flow through the hot assembly is a post-critical heat flux dispersed droplet flow. The {{heat transfer}} mechanisms that occur in blowdown cooling are complex and depend on droplet and heated surface interaction. In a safety analysis, it is of considerable importance to determine the thermal-hydraulic conditions leading to the minimum film boiling temperature, Tmin. A flow boiling rig for measurement of blowdown cooling heat transfer and quench phenomena on a nuclear fuel rod simulator was designed and constructed for operation at up to 12. 4 MPa. The test section consisted of a concentric annulus, with a 9. 5 mm OD nuclear fuel rod simulator at the center. The rod was contained within a 0. 85 mm thick, 19 mm OD 316 stainless steel tube, forming the flow channel. Two types of rods were tested; one type was sheathed with Inconel 600 while the other was clad with Zircaloy- 2. Water was injected into the test section {{at the top of}} the heated length through an injection header. This header was an annular sign that fit around the fuel rod simulator and within the stainless steel tube. Small spacers aligned the injection header and prevented contract with either the heater rod or the tube. A series of small diameter holes at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>header</b> caused the formation of droplets that became entrained with the steam flow.

40|$|In summary, a scaling {{analysis}} of a water-cooled Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS) system was performed based on generic information on the RCCS design of PBMR. The analysis demonstrates that the water-cooled RCCS can be simulated at the ANL NSTF facility at a prototypic scale in the lateral direction and about half scale in the vertical direction. Because, by necessity, the scaling {{is based on a}} number of approximations, and because no analytical information is available on the performance of a reference water-cooled RCCS, the scaling analysis presented here needs to be 'validated' by {{analysis of}} the steady state and transient performance of a reference water-cooled RCCS design. The analysis of the RCCS performance by CFD and system codes presents a number of challenges including: strong 3 -D effects in the cavity and the RCCS tubes; simulation of turbulence in flows characterized by natural circulation, high Rayleigh numbers and low Reynolds numbers; validity of heat transfer correlations for system codes for heat transfer in the cavity and the annulus of the RCCS tubes; the potential of nucleate boiling in the tubes; water flashing in the upper section of the RCCS return line (during limiting transient); and two-phase flow phenomena in the water tanks. The limited simulation of heat transfer in cavities presented in Section 4. 0, strongly underscores the need of experimental work to validate CFD codes, and heat transfer correlations for system codes, and to support the analysis and design of the RCCS. Based on the conclusions of the scaling analysis, a schematic that illustrates key attributes of the experiment system is shown in Fig. 4. This system contains the same physical elements as the PBMR RCCS, plus additional equipment to facilitate data gathering to support code validation. In particular, the prototype consists of a series of oval standpipes surrounding the reactor vessel to provide cooling of the reactor cavity during both normal and off-normal operating conditions. The standpipes are headered (in groups of four in the prototype) to water supply (header) tanks that are situated well above the reactor vessel to facilitate natural convection cooling during a loss of forced flow event. During normal operations, the water is pumped from a heat sink located outside the containment to the headered inlets to the standpipes. The water is then delivered to each standpipe through a centrally located downcomer that passes the coolant to the bottom of each pipe. The water then turns 180 {sup o} and rises up through the annular gap while extracting heat from the reactor cavity due to a combination of natural convection and radiation across the gap between the reactor vessel and standpipes. The water exits the standpipes at the top where it is headered (again in groups of four) into a return line that passes the coolant {{to the top of the}} header tank. Coolant is drawn from each tank through a fitting located near the top of the tank where it flows to the heat rejection system located outside the containment. This completes the flow circuit for normal operations. During off-normal conditions, forced convection water cooling in the RCCS is presumed to be lost, as well as the ultimate heat sink outside the containment. In this case, water is passively drawn from an open line located at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>header</b> tank. This line is orificed so that flow bypass during normal operations is small, yet the line is large enough to provide adequate flow during passive operations to remove decay heat while maintaining acceptable fuel temperatures. In the passive operating mode, water flows by natural convection from the bottom of the supply tank to the standpipes, and returns through the normal pathway to the top of the tanks. After the water reaches saturation and boiling commences, steam will pass through the top of the tanks and be vented to atmosphere. In the experiment system shown in Fig. 4, a steam condensation and collection system is included to quantify the boiling rate, thereby providing additional validation data. This system does not exist in the prototype. The first part of the report presents the non-dimensional conservation equations describing the response of the water-based RCCS during steady-state and transient operations. These equations are used to develop similarity relationships that define a scaling of the NSTF that minimizes distortions between scaled experiments and prototype operation. Then, some limited simulations of heat transfer in cavities are presented that strongly underscore the need of experimental work to validate CFD codes, and heat transfer correlations for system codes, and to support the analysis and design of the RCCS. Finally, a summary is provided of the NSTF modifications needed to conduct scaled simulations of the RCCS...|$|R
