5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced in late summer. Other non-native {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, <b>burnet</b> <b>rose</b> and oak processionary moth.|$|E
50|$|The main {{beach is}} lined with white dunes made of fine sand, which quickly leaves the room for a gray dune flatter and covered with varied plants (immortal, Ephedra distachya, <b>burnet</b> <b>rose,</b> sedum, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Phragmidium rosae-pimpinellifoliae is {{a species}} of fungus in the Phragmidiaceae family. A plant pathogen, it causes a rust on the stem, leaves, {{petioles}} and fruits of <b>burnet</b> <b>rose</b> and related hybrids. The fungus is found in Europe and North America.|$|E
50|$|Embleton {{village and}} civil parish in the English county of Northumberland is about 0.5 mi {{from the bay}} that carries its name. The sandy beach is backed by dunes where a variety of flowers bloom: bluebells, cowslips, <b>burnet</b> <b>roses</b> and, to give it its common name, bloody cranesbill, amongst others. Dunstanburgh Castle stands at the {{southern}} end of Embleton Bay. Close by, to the south, is the fishing village of Craster.|$|R
5000|$|The area is {{important}} for birds, with breeding reed warbler, sedge warbler and reed bunting in the reed bed, sallows and alders of the dune slack, common whitethroat, grasshopper warbler, skylark and European stonechats in the fixed dunes and their low scrub and <b>burnet</b> <b>roses.</b> 268 species of bird have been recorded, with up to 170 in a single year. The grasshopper warbler has recently been elevated to red status in the Birds of Conservation Concern list [...] whilst reed bunting has amber status.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1850s John <b>Burnet</b> (senior) <b>rose</b> in {{prominence}} {{with his}} designs for Glasgow buildings {{such as the}} Greek temple-style Elgin Place Church, the Clapperton/Middleton warehouse on Miller Street, and Madeira Court on Argyle Street, which was shows influences {{of the work of}} Charles Wilson. He won commissions in the 1860s from Glasgow merchants and shipowners, building large baronial houses for them at Auchendennan, Arden, Kildalton and Kilmahew.|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{the cliff}} edge {{grassland}} buckshorn plantain (Plantago coronopus), carline thistle (Carlina vulgaris), red fescue (Festuca rubra), thrift (Armeria maritima) and wild thyme (Thymus praecox) can be found. Along {{with some of}} these species bell heather (Erica cinerea), heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>burnet</b> <b>rose</b> (Rosa pimpinellifolia), catsear (Hypochaeris), eyebright (of the Euphrasia genus), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium) grow in the heathlands.|$|E
50|$|Rosa pimpinellifolia, the <b>burnet</b> <b>rose,</b> is {{a species}} of rose native to western, central and {{southern}} Europe (north to Iceland and Norway) and northwest Africa. It is generally restricted to sand dunes or limestone pavements and typically has a coastal distribution when not on limestone. In emblematic terms it is particularly associated with Scotland, where it is traditionally referenced in poetry and song, and is a symbolic native plant {{second only to the}} thistle.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Platt, {{who opened}} the bowling with [...] Fred Trueman in <b>Burnet's</b> team and <b>rose</b> to become Cricket Chairman, said: [...] "Like so many others of my generation, I started off under Ronnie in the second team and I greatly admired and {{respected}} him. [...] He was an outstanding man for Yorkshire County Cricket Club {{and he was always}} ready to give advice right up to the end. He was a strong leader and the man responsible for moulding most of the players who {{went on to win the}} championship so often." ...|$|R
50|$|The open {{landscape}} species of dry, rocky calcareous grassland {{are also found}} in refuge in Grass Wood on the steep un-wooded scar edges of the limestone, especially along the sunlit areas of Dewbottom Scar. Here can be found the locally uncommon Rock Whitebeam (Sorbus rupicola) as well as <b>Burnet</b> <b>Rose</b> (Rosa pimpinellifolia), Common Rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), Bloody Crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum), Salad-burnet (Sanguisorba minor), Wild Marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and Wild Thyme Thymus polytrichus.|$|E
50|$|Down {{the western}} edge, a good mixture of shrubs {{includes}} <b>burnet</b> <b>rose,</b> guelder-rose, spindle, wayfaring-tree and wild privet. The more common orchids of chalk scrub and woodland are present, mainly {{in one or}} two small clearings and at the field margins, but all are scarce. Many common woodland bird species are present including green and great spotted woodpecker, and goldcrest. During October and November flocks of thrushes can be seen feeding on the crop of yew berries.|$|E
5000|$|The dunes {{began to}} form in the Bronze Age, {{developing}} considerably from the 16th to the 18th century. Their formation has been reduced by planting marram grass, heather and pine trees but this has given them as darker look. As a result, they are called [...] "grey dunes" [...] while those closer to the coast, which still attract drifting sand, are known as [...] "white dunes". The area has been protected since 1940. Among the flora {{in the area are}} blue hair grass, polypody, field wormwood, thyme, lady's bedstraw and <b>burnet</b> <b>rose.</b> Bird species include the crane, which has only recently started to breed in the area, bittern, little grebe, red-necked grebe, teal, snipe and curlew.|$|E
50|$|The mountainous {{eastern half}} of the country is {{separated}} floristically {{from the rest of the}} country by the Anatolian diagonal, a floral break that crosses the country from the eastern end of the Black Sea to the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea. Many species found to the east of this break are not found to the west and vice versa, and about four hundred species are only found along this divide. The natural vegetation in eastern Turkey is the Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests; in these oaks such as Brant's oak, Lebanon oak, Aleppo oak and Mount Thabor's oak predominate in open woodland with Scots pine, <b>burnet</b> <b>rose,</b> dog-rose, oriental plane, alder, sweet chestnut, maple, Caucasian honeysuckle and common juniper.|$|E
40|$|I {{wrote an}} {{introduction}} to the story of ‘The Towton Rose ’ in the last edition of The Towton Herald. This article attempts to document the different accounts and provide a critical analysis of them. Many of the sources are not readily available so I have reproduced the relevant passages here with their references so that other researchers can follow them up if they wish. Original descriptions of ‘The Towton Rose ’ identify it as a form of the native wild rose species Rosa spinosissima (also known as Rosa pimpinellifolia), whose vernacular names include Scots Rose, Scotch Rose, <b>Burnet</b> <b>Rose</b> and Cat Rose. Later, its identity became confused with other native species and a cultivated rose, Rosa gallica ‘Versicolor ’ (often known as ‘Rosa Mundi’). The battlefield area is on the rock formation known as the Magnesian Limestone. Although Rosa spinosissima is probably most widespread on coastal sand dunes, it does occur inland, particularly on limestone. It favours the Magnesian Limestone areas of Yorkshire and is still widespread but it has disappeared from some of its former sites (probably including the battlefield) and is less abundant on others having been destroyed by ploughing, herbicides and other agricultural activity over the last 150 years or so. The Rev. G. F. Townsend, Vicar of Brantingham, Yorkshire wrote the earliest published accoun...|$|E
