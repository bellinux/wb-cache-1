40|$|Wasting {{water by}} {{excessive}} irrigation of urban residential landscapes is a ubiquitous problem. By reducing irrigation {{in excess of}} plant water needs, homeowners and cities save substantial quantities water. Although water utilities can {{use a variety of}} approaches to encourage customers to reduce their consumption, some residences may use water more efficiently than others. By understanding patterns of irrigation performance among customers, water utilities can develop more economical approaches for encouraging water conservation. Irrigation performance can be assessed by comparing outdoor water use with a landscape water budget. This requires an accurate estimate of irrigated landscape area, which can be difficult to obtain for citywide datasets. A bivariate approach using tax appraisal information is proposed, which can be applied in any county. Irrigation performance was assessed for 5, 565 single-family residences by examining their conformance to monthly water budgets. Nonconformance was defined as outdoor water use exceeding the monthly <b>budget</b> <b>volume.</b> Large lots were found to overwater by significantly greater volumes than smaller lots. However, lots with smaller landscape areas tended to overwater more frequently and apply higher volumes per unit area. These findings suggest new management options for addressing consistently wasteful water use and improving efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study conducted {{to evaluate the}} possibility of applying an helicon-double-layer plasma-thruster on UNISAT-class micro-satellite. UNISAT satellites are designed, built and operate in orbit by students, researchers and professors of GAUSS. In the framework of this program four satellite have already been launched (2 years apart one from the other, starting in 2000) by the Baykonour Cosmodrome and a fifth satellite {{is scheduled to be}} launched in the 2008. Helicon double layer thruster is an innovative type of plasma thruster firstly proposed by Australian National University (ANU) based on helicon plasma source and Double-layer effect. The paper firstly presents the analysis conducted at GAUSS (Group of Astrodynamics of University "La Sapienza"of Rome) on UNISAT in order to evaluate the available mass <b>budget,</b> <b>volume</b> budget and power budget. Moreover, the minimum required thruster-performances which can be measured using the available instrumentation onboard UNISAT have been assessed. The main requirements of the propulsion system are: thrust 1 mN, specific impulse higher than 1000 s, weight lower than 2 kg, volume lower than 1 dm 3. Then the thruster has been designed firstly applying a global-model of the helicon source and 1 -D PIC code operated by a genetic algorithms in order to identify the best optimum thruster configuration (respect to system requirements, constrains and performances) and finally using a 2 -D PIC code in order to verify and refine thruster performances.

40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{are emerging}} as the preferred platform {{for a wide variety}} of earth orbit and even interplanetary missions. These spacecraft are, by their very nature, extremely limited in <b>budget,</b> <b>volume,</b> mass and power. Existing fluid propulsion options are too large, costly and complex for many small satellite applications. In an attempt to address this problem VACCO has produced an inexpensive, modular system specifically designed for the special needs of small satellites. This paper documents the results of a development program conducted for NASA and administered by the Applied Physics Laboratory of John Hopkins University. The Cold Gas Propulsion System (CGPS) resulting from this effort is unique in several ways. It utilizes a simple “blow down” architecture which requires the entire system to operate at up to full storage tank pressure. The traditional pressure regulator has been eliminated. This required the development of unique thrusters capable of functioning with inlet pressures to 207 bar. To minimize power consumption, the thrusters feature latching valves that require an electrical pulse to open and another to close. Between pulses the thruster is magnetically latched in either the open or closed position as required. This dramatically reduces the power required by the thruster valves while preserving small impulse bit capability. In order to minimize mass and cost, the system uses only four thrusters. By mounting these thrusters in a double canted orientation to the spacecraft, pitch, yaw and roll control as well as delta V can be accomplished. In conclusion, the subject Cold Gas Propulsion System represents an important advance in propulsion technology suitable for small satellites. As a result of this work, the size, mass, power requirements and cost of these systems has been reduced...|$|E

Estimates of geostrophic transport {{from the data}} are compared with the model transport to close the <b>volume</b> <b>budget</b> north of the trans-Pacific XBT track. Advective transport from both model output and data are combined with surface fluxes to determine budgets of heat and freshwater in the closed region. The northward heat transport across the XBT track {{is estimated to be}} 0. 74 +/- 0. 1 pW, and has variability of almost 0. 5 pW on 3 - 4 year time scales, while freshwater transport is estimated to be - 0. 1 +/- 0. 06 Sv. The balance between northward advective heat transport and surface heat flux gives a time-varying estimate of heat storage that compares well with observations. A similar balance is found between model estimates of advective freshwater transport and surface freshwater flux. Despite a scarcity of observations and uncertainties in all components, this analysis results in nearly closed <b>budgets</b> of <b>volume,</b> heat, and freshwater. Mean estimates of advective transport of both heat and freshwater agree with previous estimates. An analysis of each component of the heat budget with latitude indicates that a relative lack of time-variability of the surface component is consistent throughout the North Pacific. The dominant advective component is driven by changes in the wind stress curl field. For both heat and freshwater storage, strong signals occur concurrently at all latitudes. This behavior could indicate that these signals are controlled by large-scale dynamics, rather than small-scale disturbances from which signals would need to propagate to be widely felt. The analysis demonstrates the value of bringing models and data together, resulting in budgets that are consistent with observations, yet provide a comprehensive look at the variability of North Pacific heat and freshwater storage that would be unavailable from data alone.
