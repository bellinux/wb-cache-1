5|$|Slog (voiced by Steve Little), a black-furred monster, is {{likewise}} <b>blindly</b> loyal, but lacks critical judgement skills—the more hazardous something is, {{the more likely}} he will be to follow it.|$|E
5|$|Dmowski admired Italian fascism. In {{the summer}} of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of {{articles}} admiring Mussolini and the Italian fascist model, and helped organize the Camp of Great Poland (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on Italian fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence. Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not <b>blindly</b> imitate the Italian or German models.|$|E
5|$|In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster {{and others}} hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, {{to work toward}} the {{elimination}} of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott {{raised questions about the}} validity of <b>blindly</b> following religious and social tradition.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March, the {{two ships}} <b>blindly</b> bombarded the harbour of Port Arthur from Pigeon Bay, on the {{southwest}} side of the Liaodong Peninsula, at a range of , but did little damage. When they tried again on 22 March, they were attacked by Russian coastal defence guns that had been transferred there, and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay. The Japanese ships disengaged after Fuji {{was hit by a}} 12-inch shell.|$|E
5|$|The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy {{in the face of}} mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead <b>blindly</b> after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{cover system}} allows players to move between cover, to fire <b>blindly,</b> aim freely, and target a {{specific}} enemy. Individual body parts {{can also be}} targeted. Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. Body armour {{can be used to}} absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players respawn at the nearest hospital.|$|E
5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova {{must use}} stealth and darkness to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a cloaking device {{that allows for}} temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities. Nova is also equipped with thermal imaging goggles and a special EMP device for disabling electronic devices and vehicles. In addition to the focus on stealth elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova can engage in hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will hunt for the player, set up traps, and fire <b>blindly</b> to nullify Nova's cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|In April 1839, the {{accusation}} of poisoning the young prince in 1837, {{along with two}} other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his party, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him. Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, <b>blindly</b> believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor {{and put him in}} house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public offices for seven generations.|$|E
5|$|The army's initial forces {{included}} the 9th Rifle Corps, the 271st and 276th Rifle Divisions, the 40th, 42nd and 48th Cavalry Divisions, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th irregularly formed Crimean Rifle divisions (later converted into regular rifle divisions) {{and a number}} of smaller units. However, due to what Erickson describes as Kuznetsov's 'sticking <b>blindly</b> to the prewar plan', which anticipated a seaborne assault, and leaving the Perekop and Sivash approaches too thinly held, Erich von Manstein, leading the German assault, was able to push past the defenses. Therefore, the Stavka ordered that the army command be handed over to Batov.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs <b>blindly</b> downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok <b>blindly</b> ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she <b>blindly</b> lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking {{down the stairs to the}} cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2012–13 posting season, MLB {{approached}} NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid <b>blindly,</b> MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{opened a}} file on Oppenheimer in March 1941. It {{recorded}} that {{he attended a}} meeting in December 1940 at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman, and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a Communist front organization. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency. Debates over Oppenheimer's Party membership or lack thereof have turned on very fine points; almost all historians agree he had strong left-wing sympathies during this time and interacted with Party members, though there is considerable dispute over whether he was officially {{a member of the}} Party. At his 1954 security clearance hearings, he denied {{being a member of the}} Communist Party, but identified himself as a fellow traveler, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of the goals of Communism, but without being willing to <b>blindly</b> follow orders from any Communist party apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Willoughby {{appealed to}} Pym for {{assistance}} and Pym brought Sirius, Iphigenia and Magicienne to support Nereide, launching {{an assault on}} Grand Port on 23 August. Pym had failed to properly reconnoitre the channel and Duperré had had the warning buoys removed, so that Pym's squadron was <b>blindly</b> sailing into a complicated system of reefs and channels. Sirius and Magicienne were soon irretrievably grounded while Iphigenia struggled to find a passage {{and was unable to}} close with the French squadron. Only Nereide reached Duperré's line and Willoughby's initial attack was so determined that the entire French squadron was rapidly driven ashore, only Bellone remaining in a position to exchange fire with the British frigate. A fortunate shot from Bellone cut Nereides anchor cable and the British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to the French ships which raked her repeatedly. Willoughby managed to mitigate some of the effects by cutting the other anchor cable, which brought some of his guns within range of the French, but the balance of the battle had shifted. Over the next few hours his frigate was battered from the French ships and from guns ashore until she was a dismasted, battered hulk with over 220 of her crew killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|With {{crew members}} and stevedores abandoning ship, it was {{realised}} by the dock authorities {{that there was}} a problem on board Fort Stikine. A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more fire engines to be sent for. Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre, initially only two engines were sent. Those on board Fort Stikine were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured <b>blindly</b> into the hold. With the arrival of the two fire appliances, there were now eleven hoses in use. Captain Oberst, of the Indian Army Ordnance Corps arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation. He {{was in charge of the}} explosives only after they had been landed. A meeting was held on board between the ship's officers, Oberst, and Commander Longmore of the Royal Indian Navy, the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay. It was stated by Oberst that Fort Stikine had explosives equivalent to 150 Blockbuster bombs on board and that the ship should be scuttled. Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded, but he doubted that the ship would sink in that condition. More fire appliances arrived, bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32. by 14:45, ammunition in № 2 hold was exploding. Colonel Sadler, the General Manager of the docks at Bombay, was sent for. He arrived at 14:50 and suggested that Fort Stikine should be removed from the docks, which would have required the use of tugs due to Fort Stikine being disabled. An argument developed and Colonel Sadler's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could be taken out of port.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the mob mentality, {{the story}} speaks {{about people who}} <b>blindly</b> follow traditions without {{thinking}} {{of the consequences of}} those traditions.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{a single}} roll {{provides}} {{a very weak}} basis (that is, insufficient data) to draw a meaningful conclusion about the dice. This illustrates the danger with <b>blindly</b> applying p-value without considering the experiment design.|$|E
25|$|John Kipling {{was sent}} to Loos two days into the battle in a {{reinforcement}} contingent. He was last seen stumbling through the mud <b>blindly,</b> with a possible facial injury. A body identified as his was found in 1992, although that identification has been challenged.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{many things}} that Hitler wrote, many of the {{programs}} and policies that he instituted in Germany, {{but we do not}} <b>blindly</b> copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Taymiyyah censured the {{scholars}} for <b>blindly</b> conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any {{resort to the}} Qur'an and Sunnah. He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, <b>blindly</b> giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset {{in light of the}} Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in Islamic Law. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of Taqlid (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of Jews and Christians who took their rabbis and ecclesiastics as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources. The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, after protests {{erupted in}} the capital, Khamenei intervened against the death {{sentence}} given to Hashem Aghajari for arguing that Muslims should re-interpret Islam rather than <b>blindly</b> follow leaders. Khamenei ordered {{a review of the}} sentence against Aghajari and it was later commuted to a prison sentence.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} randomized, blind {{clinical}} trials was a remote retroactive intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990–96, and <b>blindly</b> assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.|$|E
25|$|The Chechens, some of {{whom were}} {{equipped}} with gas masks, responded by firing <b>blindly</b> at the Russian positions outside. After thirty minutes, when the gas had taken effect, a physical assault on the building commenced. The combined forces entered through numerous building openings, including the roof, the basement, and finally the front door.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the tail flip is derived from an ancient limb protraction driven (as opposed to tail flexion-driven) mechanism. This is because the SGs appear to be modified limb motor neurons whose peripheral axons affect the legs and swimmerets, but end <b>blindly</b> without any known function. It is known that another effect of Giant Fiber excitation is limb promotion {{which suggests that the}} premotor limb interneurons may be ancestors of the Giant Fibers.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversial}} but undeniably important historical figure, reviled by {{many and}} followed almost <b>blindly</b> by others, Juan Lechín Oquendo died in August 2001, {{at the age}} of 87. A major criticism used against him is that he tended to de-stabilize precisely those regimes that were friendliest to the interests of the working class (Paz Estenssoro, Torres, Siles Zuazo between 1982 and 1985), while being quite deferential to the most hardline right-wing governments (Barrientos, Banzer, Garcia Mesa), at least until he could get safely out of the country.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{movement in}} modern Persian literature {{centered on the}} question of modernization and Westernization and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. It can be argued that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and Taqi Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean <b>blindly</b> copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{computer}} software typically has support {{for many more}} characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and em dashes correctly—albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit character encoding, and when unencodable characters are entered—for example by pasting from the clipboard—they are often <b>blindly</b> converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to em and en dashes, even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.|$|E
25|$|Their {{royal family}} {{is of an}} old dynasty (see House of Munsö), but the kings are {{dependent}} on {{the will of the}} people (the Thing). What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king's opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him <b>blindly</b> or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods (Æsir) and if they win they are grateful to him.|$|E
25|$|Experience {{was also}} a key element to {{learning}} for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of knowledge often practised in book learning.He argued that students would become passive adults; <b>blindly</b> obeying and lacking {{the ability to think}} on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned. He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Some puzzles are {{criticized for}} the obscurity of their solutions, for example, the {{combination}} of a clothes line, clamp, and deflated rubber duck used to gather a key stuck between the subway tracks in The Longest Journey, which exists outside of the game's narrative and serves only as an obstacle to the player. Others have been criticized for requiring players to <b>blindly</b> guess, either by clicking on the right pixel, or by guessing the right verb in games that use a text interface. Games that require players to navigate mazes have also become less popular, although the earliest text-adventure games usually required players to draw a map if they wanted to navigate the abstract space.|$|E
25|$|Walker stole {{a single}} to mid-off {{and with his}} eye fixed {{exclusively}} on the swooping fieldsman, Denness, hurtled <b>blindly</b> towards the bowler's wicket. Umpire Brooks, too, was concentrating on the ball and fieldsman whilst moving towards the off side and was skittled by the batsman who flung himself {{in the direction of}} safety with little or no consideration for the safety of others. Walker beat Denness's return to the wicket, but at the cost of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force. Umpire Brooks, having been a first class bowler in his day was a man of some substance, and pound for pound was a good match for the burly Walker. Umpire and bowler toppled slowly to the ground and...resumed their upright position slowly...|$|E
25|$|On August 18 Lanata {{said that}} {{according}} to official reports, Cristina Kirchner visited the Seychelles on January 21 and 22, {{although there was no}} record of presidential activities on those days. The islands were mentioned by Elaskar as a fiscal destination. Several months after her visit, Seychelles no longer met the criteria for tax havens. Lanata also said that Néstor Kirchner created a shell subsidiary of his Panamanian corporation in Ireland. Oscar Parrilli said that Cristina Kirchner's stay in Seychelles was 13 hours rather than two days, and criticized Lanata for <b>blindly</b> accepting official information. Parrilli called Lanata a hitman and Grupo Clarín a threat to democracy. In return, Lanata sued Parrilli for harassment. Lanata aired an interview with Venezuelan journalist Nella De Luca, who was at Kirchner's hotel and confirmed her presence.|$|E
25|$|Lowe {{was called}} out for another {{demonstration}} mission {{that would change}} the effective use of field artillery. On 24 September 1861, he was directed to position himself at Fort Corcoran, south of Washington, to ascend and overlook the Confederate encampments at Falls Church, Virginia, at a distance further south. A concealed Union artillery battery was remotely located at Camp Advance. Lowe was to give flag signal directions to the artillery, who would fire <b>blindly</b> on Falls Church. Each signal would indicate adjustments to the left, to the right, long or short. Simultaneously reports were telegraphed down to headquarters at the fort. With only a few corrections, the battery was soon landing rounds right on target. This was the precursor {{to the use of}} the artillery forward observer (FO).|$|E
25|$|UCLA {{opened the}} scoring when running back Greg Jones {{scored on a}} 12-yard run. Sophomore Zenon Andrusyshyn kicked the extra point to make it 7–0. After a USC punt, Beban had the Bruins on the move again at the USC 41-yard line. The next play, Beban took a one step drop, rolled to the right, and faked a {{sideline}} pass to the right, then wheeled around and <b>blindly</b> threw a pass in the left flat intended for running back Greg Jones. However, USC linebacker Pat Cashman was not fooled by the fake {{to the right and}} jumped in front of Jones to take an interception return 55 yards for a USC touchdown. Rikki Aldridge kicked the extra point to tie the game. While O.J. Simpson's 64-yard run became famous, this play by Cashman turned the game around.|$|E
25|$|Under the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, {{primary schools}} {{were to be}} tuition-free and {{reasonably}} located {{for the convenience of}} children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food, and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education <b>blindly</b> while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.|$|E
