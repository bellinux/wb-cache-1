25|$|In {{spite of}} the choice of {{high-end}} dresses {{turning out to be}} a correct decision, Sir Alan and Nick expressed the view that Raef had <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> that it had turned out that way, since his choice had not taken into account any business justification outside of the high price.|$|E

The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group has been pretty busy the last few years, {{executing}} missions across the capabilities of our National Maritime Strategy—and answering the call with impressive results every time.|$|E
25|$|With {{its back}} to the Negev Desert {{following}} their defeat at the Second Battle of Gaza, the EEF had <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> that the Ottoman forces did not launch a large-scale counter-attack, as such an attack would likely succeeded in pushing the EEF back a considerable distance. Regardless, the EEF faced the urgent problems of securing the positions it held {{at the end of}} the battle, and reorganising and reinforcing its severely depleted infantry divisions.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral of Chartres was {{therefore}} neither destroyed nor looted during the French Revolution and the numerous restorations {{have not diminished}} its reputation as a triumph of Gothic art. The cathedral has <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> in being spared the damage suffered by so many during the Wars of Religion and the Revolution, though the lead roof was removed to make bullets and the Directorate threatened to destroy the building as its upkeep, without a roof, had become too onerous.|$|E

As {{a result of his}} studies the geological history and sedimentary column in the Islands are better understood than those in many areas of Canada that have been studied far longer. Few scientists have <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> enough to be presented with such a challenge and opportunity, and few could have risen to and mastered such a challenge.|$|E
25|$|Indie {{asked me}} if I would keep the Barely Legal Radio program on Indie but stop doing mornings. I said yes. I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not fool-proof, however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it about the room, {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone tried to see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky as it had <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning the house down, and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, {{the rebels}} were driven westwards, and Zeng would have started in pursuit {{had he not}} been called on to clear Anhui Province of rebel forces. In 1860, he was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Liangjiang (covering Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces) and Imperial Commissioner (overseeing military affairs). At this time, and for some time previously, he had <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> in having the active support of Zuo Zongtang, who at a later period recovered Kashgar for the Qing Empire, and of Li Hongzhang. Like all true leaders of men, Zeng knew how to reward good service, and when occasion offered he appointed the former to the governorship of Zhejiang and the latter to that of Jiangsu. In 1862, he was appointed Assistant Grand Secretary of State. At this time, the Qing imperial forces, assisted by the Ever Victorious Army, had checked the progress of the Taiping Rebellion, and Zeng was able to carry out a scheme which he had long formulated of besieging Tianjing, the rebel headquarters. While Charles George Gordon of the Ever Victorious Army was clearing the cities on the lower waters of the Yangtze River with support from Li Hongzhang, Zeng drew closer his besieging lines around the city.|$|E

500|$|Washington, {{frustrated}} at {{not being able}} to confront Howe in a more decisive action, wrote in his report to Henry Laurens, president of Congress, [...] "I sincerely wish, that they had made an Attack; the Issue in all probability, from the disposition of our Troops and the strong situation of our Camp, would have <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> and happy. At the same time I must add that reason, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbade us quitting our post to attack them. Nothing but Success would have justified the measure, and this could not be expected from their position." ...|$|E

500|$|After his acquittal, Thorpe {{announced}} that he proposed to attend the 1979 Liberal assembly and the forthcoming Liberal International Congress in Canada. [...] However, his failure to explain himself under oath was widely criticised in the press, and the public perception {{was that he had}} <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> to have [...] "got off". [...] Reluctantly, Thorpe accepted that there was no future role for him within the Liberal Party, and informed the North Devon association that he would not seek to fight the seat again. Steel expressed the hope that Thorpe would, [...] "after a suitable period of rest and recuperation... find many avenues where his great talents may be used." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has <b>been</b> <b>fortunate.</b> I haven't felt that. But I know it exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work." [...] Appel then wrote {{and worked as a}} co-executive producer on The Bernie Mac Show and Kitchen Confidential, and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film I ♥ Huckabees.|$|E

500|$|Ferber was {{at first}} shocked that {{anyone would want to}} adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern {{that he did not want}} to adapt it as the typical {{frivolous}} [...] "girlie" [...] show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work. Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, [...] "This is the best musical comedy I have ever <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life..."Show Boat, with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{squadron}} armourers {{and mechanics}} repaired the faulty machine-gun synchroniser on {{his most recent}} S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6 May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the Red Baron's squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed {{to take part in}} the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote [...] "I do get tired of always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have finished".|$|E
