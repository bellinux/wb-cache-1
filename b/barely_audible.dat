5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only <b>barely</b> <b>audible.</b> Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
25|$|The bats use audible {{calls to}} {{communicate}} with each other. When at rest, they chirrup; when faced with an aggressive situation, they screech. They use social communication, touch, and chemical cues. In its home continent of Africa, it is well known for the squeaks, chirrups, and other noises that it makes that are <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> to humans.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, a {{delegation}} of Hungarian pilgrims in Turin recorded a short patriotic speech delivered by the elderly Lajos Kossuth. The original recording on two wax cylinders for the Edison phonograph survives to this day, <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> because of excess playback and unsuccessful early restoration attempts. Recording Kossuth's voice {{was one of the}} earliest applications of phonograph, and his few sentences are the earliest known recorded Hungarian speech.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} the spark depends upon the gases {{that make up the}} gaseous media. While the small sparks {{generated}} by static electricity may <b>barely</b> be <b>audible,</b> larger sparks are often accompanied by a loud snap or bang. Lightning is an example of an immense spark that can be many miles long.|$|R
40|$|Underwater {{noise was}} {{recorded}} from the Wavestar wave energy converter; a full-scale hydraulic point absorber, {{placed on a}} jack-up rig on the Danish North Sea coast. Noise was recorded 25 m from the converter with an autonomous recording unit (10 Hz to 20 kHz bandwidth). Median sound pressure levels (Leq) in third-octave bands during operation of the converter were 106 - 109 dB re. 1 μPa in the range 125 - 250 Hz, 1 - 2 dB above ambient noise levels (statistically significant). Outside the range 125 - 250 Hz the noise from the converter was undetectable above the ambient noise. During start and stop of the converter a more powerful tone at 150 Hz (sound pressure level (Leq) 121 - 125 dB re 1 μPa) was easily detectable. This tone likely originated from the hydraulic pump which was used to lower the absorbers {{into the water and}} lift them out of the water at shutdown. Noise levels from the operating wave converter were so low that they would <b>barely</b> be <b>audible</b> to marine mammals and the likelihood of negative impact from the noise appears minimal. A likely explanation for the low noise emissions is the construction of the converter where all moving parts, except for the absorbers themselves, are placed above water on a jack-up rig. The results may thus not be directly transferable to other wave converter designs but do demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} harness wave energy without noise pollution to the marine environment...|$|R
25|$|From about 1000Hz, {{the dynamic}} {{range of the}} {{auditory}} system decreases with decreasing frequency. This compression is observable in the equal-loudness-level contours, and it implies that even {{a slight increase in}} level can change the perceived loudness from <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> to loud. Combined with the natural spread in thresholds within a population, its effect may be that a very low-frequency sound which is inaudible to some people may be loud to others.|$|E
25|$|As {{an elderly}} man, Das Gupta was {{physically}} impaired from Parkinson's disease. He used wheel chair {{to move and}} his voice was <b>barely</b> <b>audible.</b> However he remained active. He always dressed up in trademark cream kurta-pyjama. His white stubble around the cheeks well passed for a French beard. It {{has been said that}} Chidananda Das Gupta was a picture of 'restraint' and 'dignity'. He died on 22 May 2011 in Kolkata after catching bronchopneumonia brought on by Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 2011, Uganda's most {{prominent}} gay activist, David Kato, was found bludgeoned {{to death in}} what authorities in Uganda characterised as a robbery. His photograph had been published in Rolling Stone. Kato had spoken at a United Nations-sponsored conference on the bill in December 2009, although his words were <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> because he was nervous. Information in US embassy cables revealed that Ugandan human rights activists and anti-homosexuality bill supporters vocally mocked him during his presentation.|$|E
25|$|Nick Riewoldt (St Kilda) {{knocked the}} ball across the field, and another pack formed as the {{official}} timekeeper's clock reached 0:00. (The timekeeper's clock is displayed on the television broadcast.) The umpire controlling play, Matthew Nicholls, signalled another ball-up to restart play; he was oblivious to {{the noise of the}} siren, which was <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> over the raucous crowd. A number of Fremantle players, particularly Scott Thornton, appeared to have either heard the siren or reacted to other players hearing the siren.|$|E
25|$|It {{could be}} argued that radio was born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission. It would be another twenty six years before the BBC National Programme was audible in Cornwall, from the then new long wave {{transmitter}} at Daventry, although BBC transmissions began in 1922. The transmission, coming a long way from Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a single earpiece, and not a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was <b>barely</b> <b>audible.</b> It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E
500|$|Shea made a rambling, {{sometimes}} <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> two-hour presentation {{that left}} {{many of those}} present speculating {{about his ability to}} do the job. A longtime friend said, [...] "That's not the real Joe Shea. He is normally incisive and well-organized." ...|$|E
500|$|Wrote Kennedy: [...] "Permitting the {{government}} to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable.

Our constitutional tradition stands against {{the idea that we}} need Oceania’s Ministry of Truth," [...] invoking George Orwell's novel 1984.|$|E
500|$|Into the Music: [...] "The album's {{last four}} songs, [...] "Angelou", [...] "And the Healing Has Begun", and [...] "It's All in the Game/You Know What They're Writing About" [...] are a veritable tour-de-force with Morrison {{summoning}} every vocal trick {{at his disposal}} from [...] "Angelou's climactic shouts to the sexually-charged, half-mumbled monologue in [...] "And the Healing Has Begun" [...] to the <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> whisper that is the album's final sound." ...|$|E
500|$|The typical song {{used by the}} red-backed fairywren to {{advertise}} its territory {{is similar to that}} of other fairy wrens, namely a reel made up of an introductory note followed by repeated short segments of song, starting weak and soft and ending high and shrill with several syllables. The call is mostly made by the male during mating season. Birds will communicate with one another while foraging with a soft ssst, <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> further than [...] away. The alarm call is a high-pitched zit.|$|E
500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's the little things that make a difference." ...|$|E
500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I {{think it might be}} <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta studied art education, {{with the}} goal of {{becoming}} an art teacher. He became a student teacher and would entertain his students with his impressions. Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just <b>barely</b> <b>audible,</b> but we didn't care. It was the fact that we got a chance to do it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would [...] "fall on his face with improvisation" [...] but soon [...] "was churning out material faster than [...] could make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, McCartney {{starred in}} the musical Give My Regards to Broad Street, a feature film he also wrote and {{produced}} which included Starr in an acting role. Disparaged by critics, Variety described the film as [...] "characterless, bloodless, and pointless". Roger Ebert awarded it a single star and wrote, [...] "you can safely skip the movie and proceed directly to the soundtrack". The album fared much better, reaching {{number one in the}} UK and producing the US top-ten hit single [...] "No More Lonely Nights", featuring David Gilmour on lead guitar. In 1985, Warner Brothers commissioned McCartney to write a song for the comedic feature film Spies Like Us. He composed and recorded the track in four days, with Phil Ramone co-producing. McCartney participated in Live Aid, performing [...] "Let it Be", but technical difficulties rendered his vocals and piano <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> for the first two verses, punctuated by squeals of feedback. Equipment technicians resolved the problems and David Bowie, Alison Moyet, Pete Townshend and Bob Geldof joined McCartney on stage, receiving an enthusiastic crowd reaction.|$|E
500|$|According to author John Tschohl, the tediousness of {{the phrase}} is {{exemplified}} by employees uttering the words so faintly as to be <b>barely</b> <b>audible.</b> The phrase is occasionally used in an ironic manner when others have been disrespectful or have negatively impacted the speaker. In Detroit, a supermarket started a program to have its cashiers tell every customer to [...] "have a nice day" [...] after completing their transactions. After conducting surveys, they realized {{that more than half}} of the customers were unaware of whether the clerk had said the phrase. In addition, a number of customers commented that they despised being told to [...] "have a nice day". In a 2006 study, researchers at Frankfurt University discovered that people who must smile and say [...] "have a nice day" [...] in their jobs are more prone to illness. Flight attendants, waiters, and call center operators, as well as others who are forced to act cheerfully, are more likely to become depressed. This can lead to decreased immune system function.|$|E
500|$|Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one {{and only}} live concert during this period. The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall {{as part of a}} Music and Fashion Festival. The trio {{performed}} four songs, [...] "Terrapin", [...] "Gigolo Aunt", [...] "Effervescing Elephant" [...] and [...] "Octopus". Poor mixing left the vocals <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> until part-way through the last number. At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off the stage. The performance has been bootlegged. Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio, recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971. [...] All three came from the Barrett album. After this session, he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an extensive interview with Mick Rock and Rolling Stone in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about touring with Jimi Hendrix and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Thorpe {{published}} an anecdotal memoir, In My Own Time, {{an anthology of}} his experiences in public life. [...] In the book he repeated his denial of any sexual relationship with Scott, and maintained that {{the decision not to}} offer evidence was made to avoid prolonging the trial, since {{it was clear that the}} prosecution's case was [...] "shot through with lies, inaccuracies and admissions". [...] In the 2005 general election campaign Thorpe appeared on television, attacking both the Conservative and Labour parties for supporting the Iraq war. Three years later, in 2008, he gave interviews to The Guardian [...] and to the Journal of Liberal History. York Membery, the Liberal journal's interviewer, found Thorpe able to communicate only in a <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> whisper, but with his brain power unimpaired. [...] Thorpe asserted that he [...] "still had steam in my pipes"; reviewing the current political situation, he considered the Labour prime minister Gordon Brown [...] "dour and unimpressive", and dubbed the Conservative leader David Cameron [...] "a phoney... a Thatcherite trying to appear progressive". Some of Thorpe's pro-Europeanism had been eroded over the years; he now thought that the European Union had become too powerful, and insufficiently accountable.|$|E
500|$|Nikki then runs {{onto the}} beach, before {{collapsing}} where Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) are playing ping pong. As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something <b>barely</b> <b>audible.</b> She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said {{before she died}} {{and come to the}} conclusion that she said, [...] "Paulo lies", although she actually said [...] "paralyzed". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a walkie talkie in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the Others, due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because [...] "they're worthless here." [...] The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave, burying her and Paulo alive.|$|E
2500|$|After Raj behaves boorishly with Penny {{while at}} a People {{magazine}} reception, and presents Penny {{to his parents}} (via webcam) as his girlfriend, he later apologizes, first with a written note.

2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed, however, Stone {{seemed to be}} more {{confident}} and animated, often dancing and engaging the audience. He performed [...] "Stand", [...] "I Want To Take You Higher", [...] "Sing A Simple Song", [...] "If You Want Me To Stay", and [...] "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)", (which at one point morphed into [...] "Thank you For Talkin' To Me Africa", a track rarely performed in public). But the show was marred by sound problems and the vocals were <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> through much of the show.|$|E
2500|$|The glottal stop [...] is the {{realisation}} of {{all four}} possible final consonants: ပ် /p/ တ် /t/ စ် /s/ က် /k/ and the retroflex ဋ် /ʈ/ found in loan words. It {{has the effect of}} shortening the vowel and precluding it from bearing tone. This itself {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "checked" [...] or [...] "entering" [...] tone, following Chinese nomenclature. It can be realised as a geminate of a following stop, although this is purely allophonic and optional as the difference between the sequence /VʔtV/ and /VtːV/ is only in the catch, and thus <b>barely</b> <b>audible.</b> The primary indicator of this final is the impact on the vowel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 East Side Digital Records {{issued a}} remixed version (by Tim Hodgkinson, May/August 1990) of Legend on CD. Fred Frith collaborated with Hodgkinson on the remixes of [...] "Nirvana for Mice" [...] and [...] "Teenbeat." [...] The CD {{included}} a bonus track, [...] "Bellycan", {{which was an}} outtake from Henry Cow's Greasy Truckers Live at Dingwalls Dance Hall recording session in November 1973. On the remix of [...] "Amygdala", Lindsay Cooper, who was not yet {{a member of the}} group {{at the time of the}} LP recording, played bassoon (recorded August 1990) and replaced Geoff Leigh's saxophone, which Hodgkinson felt was [...] "too jazzy". In addition to this, there were other radical mix changes (for instance, the closing vocals of [...] "Nirvana for Mice" [...] were mixed prominently in the original vinyl mix but are <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> on the CD).|$|E
2500|$|Yang {{also noted}} Liu Shaoqi's {{explanation}} {{on why the}} war in Korea facilitated the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, [...] "Once the gongs and drums of resisting the United States and assisting Korea begin to make a deafening sound, the gongs and drums of the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries become <b>barely</b> <b>audible,</b> and the latter becomes much easier to implement. Without the loud gongs and drums of resisting the United States and assisting Korea, those of the land reform (and zhenfan) would make unbearable noise. Here a landlord is killed and there another is beaten; there would be fuss everywhere. Things would then become difficult." [...] Yang argued that the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries was initiated in parallel with the Chinese entrance to the Korean War {{as a means of}} establishing its political authority amongst the Chinese populace via promoting patriotism and suppressing opposition elements.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most of the}} Stones' pre-1966 recordings, [...] "Satisfaction" [...] was {{originally}} released in mono only. In the mid-1980s, a true stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese editions of the CD reissue of Hot Rocks 1964–1971. The stereo mix features a piano (played by session player Jack Nitzsche, who also provides the song's iconic tambourine) and acoustic guitar that are <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> in the original mono release (both instruments are also audible on a bootleg recording of the instrumental track). This stereo mix of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but {{has not yet been}} featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese Hot Rocks CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of Hot Rocks, an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano [...] "split" [...] left and right via a delay effect.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{was paid}} a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each {{selection}} on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, {{they serve as}} {{a hint of the}} transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the swing era. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the trombonist Jack Teagarden, the trumpeter Frankie Newton, the tenor saxophonist Chu Berry, the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist Billy Taylor. Benny Goodman, who happened to be recording with Ethel Waters in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. [...] "Take Me for a Buggy Ride" [...] and [...] "Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)", both written by Wesley Wilson, were among her most popular recordings. Billie Holiday, who credited Smith as a major influence (along with Louis Armstrong), made her first record for Columbia three days later with the same band.|$|E
2500|$|Detective-III John Metcalf, LAPD, first {{investigated}} Minsky in 1982 for {{the same}} M.O. involving 4 victims. [...] Metcalf again ran across Minsky in 1998, after his release from a 2-year sentence in Massachusetts. According to Metcalf's testimony, Minsky preyed on women randomly selected from a phone book. He was able to imitate voices of various people {{to aid in the}} deception. Minsky would start cold calls by whispering at a <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> level until the victim called out a name, giving him the information needed to continue the ruse. He would then pose as an attorney to convince them that the aforementioned loved one was in legal trouble. In variations of the scam, he would say that the loved one was involved in a hit and run accident that carried a mandatory two-year sentence. He would tell the victim that a witness would have to be bribed with sex or money in order to drop charges so that their loved one would be released from jail. Minsky met with the women as the so-called witness at various locations such as hotels, and sexually assaulted some of them. In some of the cases, he urged the victim to dress provocatively for the meeting. In the 1982 cases Minsky was difficult to prosecute because there was no weapon or threat of bodily injury.|$|E
2500|$|A Sly and the Family Stone tribute {{took place}} at the 2006 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006, at which Stone gave his first live musical {{performance}} since 1987. Sly and the original Family Stone lineup (minus Larry Graham) performed briefly during a tribute to the band, for which the headliners included Steven Tyler, John Legend, Van Hunt, Nile Rodgers and Robert Randolph. Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a [...] "Sly" [...] beltbuckle and a silver lamé suit, he joined in on [...] "I Want To Take You Higher." [...] Hunched over the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> over the production. Stone walked {{to the front of the}} stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse and then with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over. [...] "He went up the ramp , got on a motorcycle and took off," [...] Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show told the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] Ehrlich said Stone refused to leave his hotel room until he was given a police escort to the show and then waited in his car until the performance began.|$|E
2500|$|Compared with Laid, {{which was}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "song" [...] album of the pair, Wah Wah was known as the [...] "experimental" [...] or [...] "jamming" [...] album, and contains 23 highly experimental tracks. Ned Raggett of Allmusic said that [...] "definitely compared to the beautifully structured and precisely produced Laid, Wah Wah is much more a series of explorations in sound." [...] The album shares Laids general focus towards an [...] "evocative, restrained attractiveness and moody melancholy," [...] but Wah Wah features more immediate numbers with full lyrics from Booth sung in his [...] "fine voice" [...] mixed with more open-ended instrumental or wordless vocal jams. [...] Some songs are by default much more fragmentary than others, lyrics [...] "just dreamed up of the top of Booth's head," [...] the rest of the band working around a rhythm loop or quietly rolling rhythm. Almost Cool said that [...] "amid the backwash of soundscapes, it's still James, and no matter how much sounds there are, Tim Booths vocals are still present, whether it's as a nearly unrecognizable cut-up wash of sound, or straight-up on fairly normal-sounding (for the group) tracks." [...] The Harvard Crimson described Wah Wah as the [...] "dark side" [...] of Laid, and commented that [...] "the 23 tracks reflect two general moods: one, a dreamy, new-age rain-foresty wash of sound over which an cerie voice intones <b>barely</b> <b>audible</b> lyrics; the other, an abrasive, Achtung Baby industrial-esque sound with distorted, staticky vocals," [...] whilst The A.V. Club said Wah Wah was [...] "a diverse, patchwork-sounding record that touched on abstract electronic experiments and noisy rock tangles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nearly universally panned by theatre critics, they concurred that Beauty and the Beast was a [...] "great spectacle, but {{not great}} theater". Likening the musical to the Empire State Building, David Richards of The New York Times called the show [...] "hardly {{a triumph of}} art, but it'll {{probably}} be a whale of a tourist attraction." [...] While awarding specific praise towards its musical numbers, choreography, costumes and cast – particularly Mann's ability to [...] "convey the delicacy of awakening love" [...] despite the physical demands of his costume, {{at the same time}} Richards criticized the production's set and special effects for lacking subtlety, ultimately accusing them of leaving little [...] "to the imagination". Richards concluded, [...] "The result is a sightseer's delight, which isn't the same thing as a theatergoer's dream." [...] Also writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby disparaged the musical entirely as [...] "relentlessly bland, busy, upbeat and robotlike", criticizing the production for resembling [...] "a dinner theater." [...] Canby felt that the new Menken-Rice songs were [...] "inferior" [...] to the originals, likened the special effects to Fourth of July sparklers, criticized the sound engineering for ranging from too loud to <b>barely</b> <b>audible,</b> and panning Woolverton's book for failing to supplement her screenplay. Minor praise was awarded to the performances of Lamberts, Beach and Fowler, as well as Mann's climactic beast-to-prince transformation. In addition to predicting that Beauty and the Beast would be derided by traditional Broadway theatre-goers and critics alike, Variety writer Jeremy Gerard was largely negative in his own review. While admitting that the production [...] "boasts several real pluses", Gerard criticized the show for appearing [...] "bloated, padded, gimmick-ridden, tacky and... utterly devoid of imagination." [...] The critic voiced his strong disapproval of the costumes while dismissing the set as [...] "something designed to be seen by people in moving seats, maybe at Disneyland", panning West's choreography and ultimately deriding Roth's directing and blocking of actors who [...] "look generally like they're following dotted lines on the stage." [...] Critics agreed that Roth's direction and West's were equally uninspired. In a mixed review with a headline reading [...] "Beauty and the Beast isn't magical in the least, even if it does bristle with magic tricks", New Yorks John Simon wrote that the production resembles [...] "a belated infomercial" [...] for the film by which he was bored, yet impressed by its special effects and illusions. Simon also felt that the actors struggled to resemble their animated counterparts despite Hould-Ward's, criticizing Egan's acting, Woolverton's dialogue and the new Menken-Rice numbers while praising Moses', Beach's and Fowler's performances.|$|E
