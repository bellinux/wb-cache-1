5000|$|Distilling bears little {{resemblance}} to existing puzzle games. Four types of marble-like [...] "bubble" [...] pieces rest in a distilling vat: dark (bad), amber (neutral), light (good), and spicy (bonus). The relative location and type of two pieces determines if they may be switched; spice pieces may not be moved. Every ten seconds, the rightmost column of bubbles is evaluated. If the bubbles on average are more light than dark, that column {{is sent to the}} tank to form part of the brew. If more of the bubbles are dark on average, the column is burnt. Light-colored bubbles that are burnt come back into the puzzle as <b>burnt</b> <b>light</b> pieces; they move the same as light pieces but count against the value of that portion of brew. The puzzle is complete when twelve columns have been sent upwards.|$|E

The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes {{found it difficult to}} distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.|$|R
50|$|Despite their difficulty, all {{remained}} calm. The crew then fired guns, launched rockets, and <b>burnt</b> blue <b>lights</b> {{to attract}} attention from the shore. They obtained no response. At 3.45 pm, the Captain then ordered the second mate take the dingy with four men to seek assistance. After calling in at Bark Bay, where they were helped by Messrs Huffam and Hadfield, the boat proceeded to Motueka.At 8am on 7 August, in heavy seas, all the remaining passengers and crew commenced abandoning the Queen Bee in the lifeboat, cutter, and Captain's gig.|$|R

To its {{northwest}} is Benner Island, from which it is separated by a relatively narrow channel, and to the east, across a wider channel, is Burnt Island (not {{to be confused with}} Burnt Island in Boothbay Harbor, where <b>Burnt</b> Island <b>Light</b> is located). The geographic features match those described in James Rosier's account of the exploratory expedition of George Waymouth, in which landing and exploration of an island is made.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{authorized}} in 1871, and {{the tower and}} keeper's house were completed the following year. The station originally had a second range light, placed {{at the site of}} the bell house, with a covered way connecting the two towers. That tower and the covered way were removed in 1884. The bell house was built in 1911, and the oil house in 1895. The station was automated in 1975. [...] The keeper's house is now maintained by the Friends of <b>Burnt</b> Coat <b>Light</b> and is open in the summer as a museum. The tower is open for climbing several days per week.|$|R

I hid him, and tonight I will go back and bury him deep." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 5 December 1809 Harlequin, {{still under}} Anstruther's command, left Plymouth Sound with {{a convoy of}} 22 vessels that she was escorting through the English Channel. On the evening of 7 December she {{suddenly}} struck the shore. Her crew chopped away her masts, fired distress guns, and <b>burnt</b> blue <b>lights.</b> Still, six other vessels in the convoy also ran ashore. Apparently, in the darkness, the vessels had mistakenly believed they had passed Beachy Head and so prematurely changed course, {{with the result that}} they ran ashore west of Seaford. Two men of Harlequins crew drowned. Apparently the warning signals saved the 16 other vessels in the convoy.|$|R

These {{changes in}} the environment vary from the dramatic, such as rearrangement of furniture, to the subtle, such as a <b>burnt</b> out <b>light</b> bulb. We do not recognize many of these changes, especially subtle changes, but robots do. I propose to use robotic sensor data to identify and adapt to these environmental changes. Traditional sensor models do not scale well {{in the face of}} these frequent environmental changes. My approach is to aggregate sensor readings into probability distributions and associate them on-line with the state of the environment. I will use the Sony AIBO robots as a test platform to verify the efficacy of the techniques I develop...|$|R

50|$|Repairs often mean simple {{replacement}} of worn or used components {{intended to be}} periodically renewed by a home-owner, such as <b>burnt</b> out <b>light</b> bulbs, worn out batteries, or overfilled vacuum cleaner bags. Another class of home repairs relates to restoring something to a useful condition, such as sharpening tools or utensils, replacing leaky faucet washers, cleaning out plumbing traps, rain gutters. Because of the required precision, specialized tools, or hazards, {{some of these are}} best left to experts such as a plumber. One emergency repair that may be necessary in this area is overflowing toilets. Most of them have a shut-off valve on a pipe beneath or behind them so that the water supply can be turned off while repairs are made, either by removing a clog or repairing a broken mechanism.|$|R
40|$|Robots {{performing}} tasks constantly encounter changing environmental conditions. These {{changes in}} the environment vary from the dramatic, such as rearrangement of furniture, to the subtle, such as a <b>burnt</b> out <b>light</b> bulb or a different carpeting. We do not recognize many of these changes, especially subtle changes, but robots do. These changes often lead {{to the failure of}} robots. In this thesis, we develop an algorithm for detecting these changes. Traditional sensor models do not capture all of the dependencies in the sensor data and are not capable of detecting all types of signal changes while maintaining a strong probabilistic foundation. This thesis corrects these shortcomings. We show how detecting the current conditions in which the robot is operating can lead to increased performance and lower failure rates. The methods in this thesis are tested on real tasks performed by a real robot, namely a Sony AIBO robot...|$|R
5000|$|Pricking {{could turn}} into a form of torture in which a subject could be {{repeatedly}} pricked until they confessed; many of the confessions gained in the 1649-50 trials were obtained in this way. In 1649 the Committee of Estates passed an Act that prevented torture in cases of witchcraft, but it was probably never implemented. In 1652, after the English occupation, it was reported in England that six witches had been whipped, their feet and heads <b>burnt</b> with <b>lighted</b> candles while they were strung up by their thumbs with their hands behind their backs. This, like most torture, was carried out by local clergy and magistrates without a warrant from the central courts, usually in trying to obtain an initial confession. B. P. Levack argues that torture was more common in [...] "panic years" [...] like 1649, leading to a growth of hunts as confessions and the names of other potential witches were obtained.|$|R
60|$|He steered {{along the}} narrow road by the black dog-rose hedge, and so into the high road towards the village. The village was alight at several windows but almost deserted.

The festivities of the Flower Show were still in full progress, and the {{reduction}} of the entrance fee after seven had drawn in every lingering outsider. The roundabouts churned out their relentless music, and the bottle-shooting galleries popped and crashed. The well-patronised ostriches and motorcars flickered round in a pulsing rhythm; black, black, black, before the naphtha flares.|$|R

Seeing my eye fixed upon him, he went outside {{to give way to}} his grief in the passage. Obviously the only hope lay in Ayesha. She, and she alone--unless, indeed, she was an imposter, which I could not believe--could save him. I would go and implore her to come. As I started to do so, however, Job came flying into the room, his hair literally standing on end with terror.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{her second}} voyage to Australia in 1859 with 419 {{government}} immigrants, Herald of the Morning was anchored in Hobson's Bay, when at about 12:45 pm on 15 November the captain awoke to someone yelling out FIRE! The fire quickly spread through the entire vessel. Despite attempts to scuttle the ship by cutting holes in her side near the waterline, as she <b>burnt</b> and became <b>lighter</b> so that the scuttling holes rose above the water level. An attempt was made to move the ship, by slipping the anchor chains, but the heat drove the crew back from the other. Finally it was cut through from the outside and towed ashore at Sandridge (Port Melbourne) by two tugs, Lioness and Sophia, and left to burn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other side}} of the slab of {{limestone}} has a natural depression in which fat was <b>burnt,</b> likely for <b>lighting</b> the rock shelter. The engraving seems to have been made after the stone lamp broke, as the figure is neatly centered on the fragment. The headless figure is shown from the side, bending to the right, with the large rounded buttocks and thigh carefully drawn. The thin torso features a small sharp triangle that may indicate the breasts, or perhaps arms held out. The two lines defining the front and rear of the profile are continuous and [...] "confidently drawn", though they converge at knee level. Extra lines below the waist may represent an apron or skirt. [...] Similar characteristics can be found in engraved figures from Neuwied in Germany.|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} the renegade Ismeno stood before him--a bad {{old man who}} had studied unlawful arts. He could bind and loose evil spirits, and draw the dead out of their tombs, restoring to them breath and perception. This man told the king, that in the church belonging to his Christian subjects there was an altar underground, on which stood a veiled image of the woman whom they worshipped--the mother, as they called her, of their dead and buried God. A dazzling <b>light</b> <b>burnt</b> for ever before it; and the walls were hung with the offerings of her credulous devotees. If this image, he said, were taken away by the king's own hand, and {{set up in a}} mosque, such a spell of enchantment could be thrown about it as should render the city impregnable so long as the idol was kept safe.|$|R
60|$|He quitted the painter's {{and walked}} swiftly homeward with a triumphant {{buoyancy}} of step. A subtle content diffused itself over his face, and a joyful <b>light</b> <b>burnt</b> in his deep eyes. He sat down before {{the piano and}} organ as he had arranged them, and began to strike their keys in unison; this seemed to {{him for the first}} time childish. Then he played some lively bars on the piano alone; they sounded too light and trivial, and he turned to the other instrument. As the plaint of the reeds arose, it filled his sense like a solemn organ-music, and transfigured the place; the notes swelled to the ample vault of a church, and at the high altar he was celebrating the mass in his sacerdotal robes. He suddenly caught his fingers away from the keys; his breast heaved, he hid his face in his hands.|$|R
60|$|I awoke and bounded {{from the}} bed, a cold {{perspiration}} pouring from me. In the darkness {{on the other}} side of the hut I heard sounds of furious struggling. Luckily I kept my head. Just by me was a chair on which were matches and a rush taper. I struck a match and held it to the taper. Now in the growing light I could see two forms rolling one over the other on the floor, and from between them came the flash of steel. The fat melted and the <b>light</b> <b>burnt</b> up. It was Indaba-zimbi and the woman Hendrika who were struggling, and, what is more, the woman was getting the better of the man, strong as he was. I rushed towards them. Now she was uppermost, now she had wrenched herself from his fierce grip, and now the great knife she had in her hand flashed up.|$|R
