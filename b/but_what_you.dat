500|$|In {{a review}} of Manson's album, his {{rendition}} of [...] "Cease to Exist" [...] was regarded as [...] "one of Manson's signature performances, and has justifiably invited comparison with Jim Croce and José Feliciano". Critic Michael Little considers Manson's version superior to the Beach Boys', having praise especially for Manson's vocals. Naturally, Little attests, [...] "you expect a tattered, raw, and raggedy voice, {{with a touch of}} lunatic rage, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get is a smooth-voiced folk singer". He also wrote that Manson's raw, stripped-down take [...] "gives the song an impressive lo-fi immediacy that is a million miles away from the Beach Boys' treatment".|$|E
500|$|Srikula adepts {{most often}} worship Lalita using the {{abstract}} Sri Chakra yantra, which {{is regarded as}} her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily {{as part of the}} worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the Sri Meru. It is not uncommon to find a Sri Chakra or Sri Meru installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – [...] "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see in the temples is not the srichakra worship you see when it is done privately." ...|$|E

[...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." [...] He added that [...] "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ewbank's {{coaching}} {{style was}} laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. [...] "Weeb combined a low-key style with {{a flair for}} the most dramatic of accomplishments", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. [...] "He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred {{to stay in the}} background and let the players take the credit." [...] He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown [...] "had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, execute it flawlessly", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.|$|E

2500|$|Another of his teachers, artist Robert Henri, taught life class. Henri {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to use their art to [...] "make a stir in the world". He also advised his students, [...] "It isn't the subject that counts <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> feel about it" [...] and [...] "Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life." [...] In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as notable future artists George Bellows and Rockwell Kent. He encouraged them to imbue a modern spirit in their work. Some artists in Henri's circle, including John Sloan, became members of [...] "The Eight", {{also known as the}} Ashcan School of American Art. Hopper's first existing oil painting to hint at his famous interiors was Solitary Figure in a Theater (c.1904). During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including his self-portraits.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, your lawyer, people said some nice things about you, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{minute of the}} second round Castillo went down on a shot by Mayweather, which was ruled a slip by the referee. Later in the fight Harold Lederman alluded to it, saying [...] "By the way, that {{knockdown}} {{in the second round}} [...] extremely questionable, I thought Floyd did throw a left hook and this guy [...] went {{down at the end of}} the hook <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> going to do, it's a judgement call by the referee, so it doesn't go as a 10–8 round..." [...] Drakulich took a point from Castillo for hitting on the break in the eighth round after several warnings throughout the fight. With Castillo repeatedly hitting on the break, this led to a large number of his punches landing. George Foreman agreed with the decision ("That's what you want a referee to do"), although his counterpart Larry Merchant had an alternative view: [...] "I think this referee has been altogether too involved in the fight. Too officious". Drakulich struck again in the ninth round, this time taking a point away from Mayweather for using his elbows. Mayweather won the fight by using his jab effectively and staying away from Castillo for much of the fight. Having injured his left shoulder on the last day of training, he changed to a southpaw stance on several occasions to throw more right-handed punches.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
2500|$|West {{attempted}} to cast his work overseas in historical terms, theorizing that America is {{following in the}} footsteps of Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, or the 300 Spartan Hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylae, in defending Western civilization against Muslim threats from the Middle East. In speaking on what he believed to be Islam's proclivity for violence, West remarked that [...] "Something happened when Mohammed enacted the Hijra and he left Mecca and he went out to Medina, it became violence." [...] Because of this view, in February2011, West cited the threat of [...] "radical Islamic terrorists" [...] as his motivation for voting to extend provisions of the Patriot Act; He voted against another extension in May 2011. When asked during an interview with The Shalom Show how he would work with others [...] "like Keith Ellison, who supports Islam," [...] West stated that Ellison, a Minnesota representative and practicing Muslim, represents the [...] "antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established." [...] West later argued that his initial comment was misconstrued. He said the comments were [...] "not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)." [...] In a Boynton Beach Town Hall meeting, West told the Miami leader of CAIR that [...] "I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> must understand, if I am speaking the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth.

2500|$|In April 2015, {{during a}} video conference {{to promote the}} {{documentary}} Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013. [...] "It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan [...] "was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result {{was caused by the}} United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened." [...] Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that [...] "our code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn’t think much more of it. [...] We didn’t think this was anything more than just distracting." [...] Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.|$|E

2500|$|While {{sharing a}} flat with Barry Gibb in London in late 1967, Young was {{encouraged}} to write songs. Gibb taught him that [...] "there are no rules in song-writing, there is a structure, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{need to do is}} find the 'hook', and it could be in the melody, the chorus, the words or even an identifiable riff, and that can be the difference in writing a hit record." [...] During 1968, back in Australia, Young wrote [...] "The Real Thing" [...] as a reaction against a Coca-Cola jingle, [...] "Coke is the real thing". Young envisaged the song as a low-key acoustic ballad (in the style of The Beatles [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever") and he originally intended it for his friend and fellow singer Ronnie Burns. Young was practising the song in a dressing room during taping of TV pop music show Uptight when pop producer and fellow Go-Set writer Ian Meldrum heard it. Meldrum (who was also manager for solo singer Russell Morris (ex-Somebody's Image) was greatly impressed by the song and immediately insisted that Young cut a demo of it for Morris. Under Meldrum's production and with the collaboration of engineer John L. Sayers the song was radically transformed into a seven-minute psychedelic epic, with a elaborately edited backing track performed by an all-star band including ex-Zoot guitarist Roger Hicks (who composed the acoustic guitar intro), members of Melbourne band The Groop and backing vocalist Maureen Elkner. Reportedly the most expensive single ever recorded in Australia up to that time, it became one of the biggest Australian pop hits of 1969, peaking at numberone in May and was numberone on Go-Set Top Records for the Year of 1969, and made Morris an immediate national star. It was later covered by Kylie Minogue and by Midnight Oil. Young's next song for Morris, [...] "The Girl That I Love", was released as a double-A-side with [...] "Part Three into Paper Walls" [...] (another epic extended production co-written by Morris and Young) which reached numberone in October.|$|E
