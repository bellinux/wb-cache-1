40|$|The {{structure}} of a series <b>of</b> packed <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylindrical particles has been investigated and compared with those <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and equilateral cylinders of similar dimensions. It is found that the mean voidage <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> equilateral cylinders is consistently lower than the corresponding values for <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and non-equilateral cylinders of aspect ratios 0. 25, 0. 5, 2 and 3. End effects {{do not appear to}} be present in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> cylinders of aspect ratios of 0. 25 and 0. 5 and generally, both wall and end effects are significantly weaker than corresponding effects in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and equilateral cylinders. This suggests that chanelling is reduced in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylindrical pellets. Whilst the axial voidage distribution <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylinders appears to be almost uniform, the radial voidage distribution bears the effect of confining walls and an oscillatory profile is observed in most cases, but is seen to be irregular for aspect ratios 0. 25 and 0. 5. The orientation effect of particles of aspect ratio 0. 25 in adjacent layers causes an irregular pattern in the axially averaged radial voidage distribution. Observed axially averaged radial voidage profiles suggest that a uniform structure may be achieved by modifying the basic cylindrical shape. 1...|$|R

The Seven Sisters, a 1915 production, was filmed at the Briarcliff Lodge. The 1970 House of Dark Shadows and the 1972 Merchant Ivory film Savages were filmed at the Beechwood mansion in Scarborough. <b>Bed</b> <b>of</b> Roses was {{released}} in 1996, and was filmed at an 1860s house on Scarborough Road which was the home of Eileen O'Connor Weber. Super Troopers, released in 2001, was partially filmed on the Taconic State Parkway from Poughkeepsie to Briarcliff Manor. Analyze That, a film from 2002, was filmed {{in the village and}} nearby locations, including the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in the village of Ossining. The 2007 film First Born was filmed at a house in Briarcliff Manor. American Gangster, also released in 2007, includes scenes filmed at two village houses. Some parts of the 2012 film The Bourne Legacy were filmed at the village's entranceway to the Taconic State Parkway and at other roads in the village. The 2013 dark comedy Inside Llewyn Davis was partially filmed at Pace University's Briarcliff campus, adapting its dining hall into a 1960s Fred Harvey restaurant in an Illinois Tollway oasis.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} role of gas {{viscosity}} in the behavior <b>of</b> gas-fluidized <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> fine powders by means of experimental measurements using nitrogen and neon as fluidizing gases, and theoretical considerations. The existence of a nonbubbling fluidlike regime has been recently observed in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> fine powders fluidized with nitrogen. Our experiments with neon reveal a discontinuous transition from heterogeneous fluidization to a highly expanded homogeneous fluidization state. We point out that increasing gas viscosity enhances the coherence of agglomerate swarms, which promotes a local void-splitting mechanism, thus improving the uniformity of fluidization. Our theoretical analysis predicts that further increase of gas viscosity would produce a full suppression of the bubbling regime, i. e., the uniformly fluidized bed would undergo a direct transition to a turbulent regime as seen in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> nanoparticles fluidized by nitrogen and in liquid-fluidized <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> moderate-density beads...|$|R
