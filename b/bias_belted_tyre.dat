Above a steady forward vehicle speed of 40 km/h this is the dominant noise source of a modern car in good working condition, and is a significant contributor to the overall radiated noise during acceleration. In order to determine the noise produced by a patterned tyre rolling on a rough road surface, the vibration characteristics of the tyre must be known. A method has been presented by O'Boy and Dowling [Tyre/road interaction noise: a 3 d viscoelastic multilayer model of a <b>tyre</b> <b>belt,</b> Journal of Sound and Vibration, volume 322, issues 4 - 5, 22 May 2009, pages 829 - 850] which provides these vibration characteristics for a <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> composed of multiple viscoclastic layers, each layer having a different thickness and material properties. In this paper, we use this model of the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> to determine the parameters of an equivalent simple bending plate model which can be adapted to yield the response of a tyre which includes sidewalls. A method is then described which uses this response to determine the acceleration of the tyre surface as it rolls over a rough road.

Smooth road surfaces in the database highlight contributions in the low and medium frequency domain not related to the enveloped road texture and suggest to also considering the tyre tread pattern for the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> radiated noise level prediction. Due to the essentially different road and tyre tread roughnesses, 2 D profiles are no longer suitable and therefore a 3 D envelopment procedure is proposed to account for a combined road and tyre roughness. This 3 D procedure is tested on a database which includes 3 D texture and noise measurements performed on a set of impervious road surfaces within the DEUFRAKO ODSurf project.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] aim {{of this article is to}} assess the influence of the tyre/road contact interface on driveline vibrations. The mode shapes of a vehicle driveline are obtained and analysed, initially using three tyre models: a simple torsional spring, linear slip, and relaxation length-based models. Additionally, a fully transient load- and slip-dependent non-linear relaxation length model is incorporated into the driveline to determine the dynamic response on different surfaces. Simulations of pull-away manoeuvres on various surfaces are carried out. The halfshaft torque in each case is analysed and conclusions drawn on the effect of tyre dynamics on the frequency and intensity of driveline vibrations. In order to investigate the influence of higher-frequency tyre dynamics, a model incorporating <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> inertia is simulated for the same cases. It is found that the higher-order dynamics introduced by the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> result in additional frequencies in the response, as well as differences in response amplitude. Using the non-linear relaxation length and belt inertia models it is observed that low-μ surfaces promote driveline vibrations at higher and more numerous frequencies compared with the typical shuffle response observed on a high-μ surface. It is shown that this frequency migration can be physically explained by considering the effect of decoupling between driveline and vehicle on low-μ surfaces. It is also shown that the observed frequencies can be predicted by appropriately modified linear models...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} part of driver education is to convince the candidates to use the safety equipment in the car such as safety belts and airbags in a correct manner. If there is an accident, the injuries will be less severe if the safety equipment are not only used but also used in a correct way. There are, however, findings showing that there are gaps in the current driver education {{when it comes to}} convincing candidates to use safety equipment. At some of the skid tracks in Sweden, an additional educational concept has been developed that is focusing on convincing drivers to use the safety equipment in the car. The concept is named "Safety halls" where the main aim is to provide knowledge about the different safety equipment of the car and how it should be used in order to create highest possible safety. Candidates doing the mandatory skid training at these skid tracks will also attend this new training. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the possible effects of safety halls on the candidates' knowledge, attitudes and self reported behaviour regarding the areas safety <b>belts,</b> <b>tyres,</b> sitting posture, load, airbag, and speed. The study was carried out at the eight skid tracks in Sweden that had a safety hall at the time of the evaluation. At all skid tracks, candidates were randomly distributed into an experiment group (skid training and safety hall) and a control group (only skid training). At the arrival to the skid track all candidates filled out a questionnaire (before measurement). The same candidates also filled out the same questionnaire directly after finishing the education programme (after measurement 1). Four and a half months later a similar questionnaire was sent by post to the same candidates (after measurement 2). A total of 1, 326 candidates (658 in the experiment group and 668 in the control group) filled out all three questionnaires and thus formed the sample for the overall analyses. In the questionnaires, questions were asked about background factors such as age, gender, highest education in the family etc. There were also knowledge questions, attitude questions and questions about self reported behaviour. In general, the findings show that the extra education in safety halls increases the knowledge, improves the attitudes about traffic safety and strengthen the intentions to behave safe. The improvements are largest when measured directly after the education, but effects still remain after 4 ½ months. Some of the areas covered shows better results (in the experiment group compared to the control group) than others. Above all, the two areas safety belts and load showed the best results on knowledge, attitudes and intentions, both in a short and long term. The evaluation has also shown that there is a need for improvement of the current education in the safety halls if the expected effects should be improved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel <b>belted</b> radial <b>tyre</b> under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the <b>tyre</b> including ply, <b>belts,</b> and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted radial tyre subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|R

40|$|For {{efficient}} analysis it {{is important}} to choose the proper model that fits the problem that needs to be solved. This paper discusses three pragmatic simulation models for longitudinal behaviour of a passenger car tyre (Steady State, Transient and Rigid Ring) that may be used in e. g. an ABS simulation. The characteristics of the simulation models are evaluated using some simple simulations. Simulations with a quarter vehicle model that includes load transfer effects are carried out to determine the deviation in results between the mentioned tyre models for an ABS application. The results show that the Steady State model may only be used below 10 Hz and that the Transient model is valid up to about 30 Hz. The results from the ABS simulation with the Rigid Ring model are most reliable and are clearly different from the Steady State and Transient model, which indicates that ABS simulations should be carried out with the Rigid Ring model. Additionally it is demonstrated that for tyre behaviour on uneven roads the influence of the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> cannot be neglected...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe road texture plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} tyre/road noise generation. Bi-dimensional profiles are often used to evaluate the performances of road surfaces as regards the rolling noise emission. In order to predict noise levels from bi-dimensional longitudinal texture profiles, assumptions concerning the three-dimensional distribution properties of the road surface are required. If these assumptions are not met, a deviation may occur in the noise level evaluation. This paper aims at providing an insight into the expected radiated noise level variability due to possible texture anisotropy {{in the case of a}} slick tyre. The approach used in this paper is based on simulation tools intended to provide texture and noise data which are statistically analyzed afterwards. Three-dimensional gaussian random texture fields are numerically generated from a known bi-dimensional texture power spectral density assuming elliptical anisotropy. These texture fields are used as input of a dynamic rolling model that provides the radial vibration of the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt.</b> The resulting radiated noise levels are evaluated with a BEM model. The relationships obtained between the elliptical anisotropy rating and the calculated noise levels are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the increasing competition which pervades the automobile sector, {{it is necessary to}} develop simple methods to enable prediction of suspension loading level envelope in an early development stage. For this purpose, the FORD specified standard driving manoeuvres, based on kerb strike and pothole braking, inducing worst case loading scenarios are employed. The damaging nature of these tests and the relatively expensive physical prototypes make simple simulation models essential. These models should cope with an initial rudimentary assessment, but must suffice to predict the maximum wheel centre loads with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Enhanced model features are required to represent edge-type tyre deformation and impulsive bumper deflection. State of the art approaches are physical tyre models extended to rim clash modelling and rheological bumper models embedded in an multibody system (MBS) environment. These enhancements lead to increased complexity. The thesis proposes a minimal parameter vehicle model, tailored to predict vertical suspension loads caused by the FORD kerb strike manoeuvre. Since the focus is put on model simplicity, an in-plane bicycle model is extended to 7 degrees of freedom. Nonlinear and hysteretic characteristics of the bump-stop elements are included through use of a spatial map concept, based on displacement and velocity dependent hysteresis. Furthermore, a static tyre model is described to predict the radial stiffness against penetration of an edge and flat-type rigid body geometry. The full mathematical model is derived {{on the basis of the}} shell theory and represented in terms of few geometrical input parameters. A distinct tyre model, representing the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> as a multi-link chain is also derived to confirm the assumptions made in the simple mathematical model. Model validation is supported through experiments at both component and system levels. It is shown that the bumper map concept provides an accurate, yet simple alternative to a rheological model, if applied to polyurethane foam type bumpers. This approach is also confirmed for the tyre model, substituting a comprehensive physical model approach...|$|R
40|$|Traffic is a {{major source}} of green house gases. The {{transport}} field stands for 32 % of the energy consumption and 28 % of the total CO 2 emissions, where road transports alone causes 84 % of these figures. The energy consumed by a car traveling at constant speed, is due to engine ineffiency, internal friction, and the energy needed to overcome resisting forces such as aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. Rolling resistance plays a rather large role when it comes to fuel economy. An improvement in rolling resistance of 10 % can yield fuel consumption improvements ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 % for passenger cars and light trucks and 1. 5 to 3 % for heavy trucks. The objective of this thesis is to estimate the power consumption in the tyres. To do this a car tyre is modeled with waveguide finite elements. A non-linear contact model is used to calculate the contact forces as the tyre is rolling on a rough road. The contact forces combined with the response of the tyre is used to estimate the input power to the tyre structure, which determines {{a significant part of the}} rolling resistance. The tyre model accounts for: the curvature, the geometry of the cross-section, the pre-stress due to inflation pressure, the anisotropic material properties and the rigid body properties of the rim. The model is based on design data. The motion of the <b>tyre</b> <b>belt</b> and side wall is described with quadratic anisotropic, deep shell elements that includes pre-stress and the motion of the tread on top of the tyre by quadratic, Lagrange type, homogenous, isotropic two dimensional elements. To validate the tyre model, mobility measurements and an experimental modal analysis has been made. The model agrees very well with point mobility measurements up to roughly 250 Hz. The eigenfrequency prediction is within five percent for most of the identified modes. The estimated damping is a bit too low especially for the antisymmetric modes. Above 500 Hz there is an error ranging from 1. 5 dB up to 3. 5 dB for the squared amplitude of the point mobility. The non proportional damping used in the model is based on an ad hoc curve fitting procedure against measured mobilities. The contact force predictions, made by the division of applied acoustics, Chalmers University of Technology, are based on a non-linear contact model in which the tyre structure is described by its flexibility matrix. Topographies of the surface are scanned, the tread pattern is accounted for, and then the tyre is ’rolled’ over it. The contact forces are inserted into the tyre model and the response is calculated. The dissipated power is then calculated through the injected power and the power dissipated within each element. Results are promising compared to literature and measurements.
