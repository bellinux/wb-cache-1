5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

Many locations are named after her, including Dare County, North Carolina; the Virginia Dare Trail, a section of NC 12; Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge, the second, newest, and widest bridge spanning the Croatan Sound connecting Roanoke Island to Manns Harbor, carrying US 64. Residents of Roanoke Island celebrate Virginia Dare's birthday each year with an Elizabethan Renaissance fair. A statue of Virginia as a grown woman, nude and wrapped in a <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> is {{on display in the}} Elizabethan Gardens on the island.

25|$|Each {{ethnic group}} has {{distinct}} performing arts, with little overlap between them. Malay art shows some North Indian influence. A form of art called mak yong, incorporating dance and drama, remains {{strong in the}} Kelantan state. However, older Malayan-Thai performing arts such as mak yong have declined in popularity throughout the country due to their Hindu-Buddhist origin. Since the Islamisation period, the arts and tourism ministry have focused on newer dances of Portuguese, Middle Eastern, or Mughal origin. Malay traditional dances include joget melayu and zapin. In recent years, dikir barat has grown in popularity, and it is actively promoted by state governments as a cultural icon. Silat is another popular Malay martial art and dance form, believed to increase a person's spiritual strength. Wayang kulit (shadow puppet theatre) has been popular in Malaysia for centuries. The puppets are usually made with cow and <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> and are carved and painted by hand. Plays done with shadow puppets are often based on traditional stories, especially tales from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Traditionally, theatrical music is performed only by men. Javanese immigrants brought Kuda Kepang to Johor, and {{is a form of}} dance where dancers sit on mock horses and tells the tales of Islamic wars. The Chinese communities brought traditional lion dances and dragon dances with them, while Indians brought art forms such as Bharata Natyam and Bhangra. Colonialism also brought other art forms, such as the Portuguese Farapeira and Branyo. There are a variety of traditional dances, which often have very strong spiritual significance. Different tribes from west and east Malaysia have different dances.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Army {{declared}} the First Battle of Adobe Walls a victory. The Kiowa, to the contrary, recorded in their annual record, painted on <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> that the period was [...] "muddy travel winter, {{the time when}} the Kiowas repelled Kit Carson." [...] Carson was well known by all the Indians of the Southern Plains. The battle left the Comanche and Kiowa unchallenged in their control of the Texas Panhandle until the Battle of the North Fork of the Red River eight years later.|$|E
2500|$|... "A tall cottonwood Sun Dance pole {{was set in}} {{the center}} of the dancing area. [...] Bits of flesh, pinches of tobacco and a pipe were placed in the hole before the pole was raised. [...] The pole symbolically became the stem of the pipe, {{providing}} the communication with the Great Spirit. A large shade was then constructed around the Sun Dance Pole, its roof made of animal skins. [...] As each family group came in, they brought a <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> some covered with wooly brown hair and others tanned a dusty gray. [...] Those who had no buffalo robes brought elk, bear, deer or even sewn-together rabbit skins. [...] Nearby were the medicine man’s tipi where the main dancers prayed and meditated, the sweat bath lodge for purification rights with a huge fireplace." [...] According to Lakota custom, a commemorative marker of five rocks was placed in a wide V-formation at the ceremonial grounds at the foot of Beaver Mountain in northwestern Nebraska, and reverently dedicated to War Chief Crazy Horse. The rocks were also intended as a permanent memorial to the devotion of the five tribes of the Lakota represented at the ceremony and the five warrior cousins who sacrificed their blood and flesh on behalf of Crazy Horse.|$|E

60|$|By {{the advice}} of Sunlight, she took care not to let them see her, and climbed a thick tree, where she could see and hear without being seen herself. Then he neighed, and the mares came {{galloping}} up, eager {{to see the new}} comer--all but one horse, who did not like strangers, and thought they were very well as they were. As Sunlight stood his ground, well pleased with the attention paid him, this sulky creature suddenly advanced to the charge, and bit so violently that {{had it not been for}} the nine <b>buffalo</b> <b>skins</b> Sunlight's last moment would have come. When the fight was ended, the <b>buffalo</b> <b>skins</b> were in ribbons, and the beaten animal writhing with pain on the grass.|$|R
60|$|But besides these common habits, {{they have}} {{official}} and ceremonious occasions, {{on which they}} wear beautiful furs and theatrical dresses and disguises, including large masks; and their war-dress, formed of a thick doubled leathern mantle of elk or <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> frequently with a cloak over it, on which the hoofs of horses were strung, makes an almost impervious cuirass. Their love for music, general lively dispositions, except from provocation, but determination in avenging insult or wrong, is testified by all.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless he {{was getting}} wet to no purpose. There was the tool-house and carpenter's shed near the bank; its floor was thickly covered with sawdust and pine-wood shavings, {{and there was a}} mouldy <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin</b> which he had once transported thither from the old wagon-bed. There, too, was his secret cache of a candle in a bottle, buried with other piratical treasures in the {{presence}} of the youthful Peters, who consented to be sacrificed on the spot in buccaneering fashion to complete the unhallowed rites. He unearthed the candle, lit it, and clearing away a part of the shavings stood it up on the floor. He then brought a prized, battered, and coverless volume from a hidden recess in the rafters, and lying down with the buffalo robe over him, and his cap in his hand ready to extinguish the light at the first footstep of a trespasser, gave himself up--as he had given himself up, I fear, many other times--to the enchantment of the page before him.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a good}} {{orthodox}} {{custom of}} old times to take {{every part of the}} domestic establishment to meeting, even down to the faithful dog, who, as he had supervised the labors of the week, also came with due particularity to supervise the worship of Sunday. I think I can see now the fitting out on a Sunday morning--the one wagon, or two, as the case might be, tackled up with an [...] "old gray" [...] or an [...] "old bay," [...] with a <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin</b> over the seat by way of cushion, and all the family, in their Sunday best, packed in for meeting; while Master Bose, Watch, or Towser stood prepared to be an outguard and went meekly trotting up hill and down dale in the rear. Arrived at meeting, the canine part of the establishment generally conducted themselves with great decorum, lying down and going to sleep as decently as any body present, except when some of the business-loving bluebottles aforesaid would make a sortie upon them, when you might hear the snap of their jaws as they vainly sought to lay hold of the offender. Now and then, between some of the sixthlies, seventhlies, and eighthlies, you might hear some old patriarch giving himself a rousing shake, and pitpatting soberly up the aisles, as if to see that every thing was going on properly, after which he would lie down and compose himself to sleep again; and certainly this was as improving a way of spending Sunday as a good Christian dog could desire.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} Fort Smith was {{established}} in 1817, larger capacity watercraft became available to transport goods {{up and down the}} Arkansas. These included flatboats (bateaus) and keelboats. Along with the pirogues, they transported piles of deer, bear, otter, beaver and <b>buffalo</b> <b>skins</b> up and down the river. Agricultural products such as corn, rice, dried peaches, beans, peanuts, snake root, sarsaparilla, ginseng had grown in economic importance.|$|R
60|$|The {{boy said}} nothing, but lay {{down for the}} third time on the <b>buffalo</b> <b>skins,</b> and fasted for twenty days more. And {{at the end of that}} time the witch thought he was dead, his face was so white and his body so still. But when she had fed him out of the bowl he grew stronger, and soon was able to sit up.|$|R
6000|$|Soon the sleigh {{appeared}} in sight, {{coming up the}} river at full speed, and a loud [...] "hurrah!" [...] from {{the men at the}} gate, told the visitor that he was a welcome guest. It was a dog-sleigh--a sort of conveyance much used by the fur-traders in winter travelling. In form, it was as like as possible to a tin slipper bath. It might also be compared to a shoe. If the reader will try to conceive of a shoe large enough to hold a man, sitting with his legs out before him, that will give him a good idea of the shape of a dog cariole. There is sometimes an ornamental curve in front. It is made of two thin hardwood planks curled up in front, with a light frame-work of wood, covered over with deer or <b>buffalo</b> <b>skin,</b> and painted in a very gay manner. Four dogs are usually harnessed to it, and these are quite sufficient to drag a man on a journey of many days, over every sort of country, where there is no road whatever. Dogs are much used for hauling little sledges in that country in winter. The traveller sits wrapped up so completely in furs, that nothing but his head is visible. He is attended by a driver on snow-shoes, who is armed with a large whip. No reins are used. If the snow is hard, as is usually the case on the surface of a lake or river, the driver walks behind and holds on to a tail-line, to prevent the dogs from running away. If the traveller's way lies through the woods, the snow is so soft and deep that the poor dogs are neither willing nor able to run away. It is {{as much as they can}} do to walk; so the driver goes before them, in this case, and beats down the snow with his snow-shoes--"beats the track," [...] as it is called. The harness of the dogs is usually very gay, and covered with little bells which give forth a cheerful tinkling sound.|$|E

50|$|Bourgmont {{wrote that}} the Padouca {{maintained}} permanent villages. They sent out regular hunting parties, in groups of 50-100 households. As one hunting party returned, another would leave, so that the village was occupied at all times. They journeyed up to {{five or six days}} travel from their village to hunt. The Padouca sowed corn and pumpkins. They obtained tobacco and horses from trade with the Spanish in New Mexico in exchange for tanned <b>buffalo</b> <b>skins.</b> The explorer noticed that some of the Apache still used flint knives for <b>skinning</b> <b>buffalo</b> and felling trees, an indicator that not much European trade had reached them.|$|R
