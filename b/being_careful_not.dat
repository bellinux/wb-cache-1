5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to make sure that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to suggest sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E

25|$|Kali means joy or fun and games. This is {{also known}} as Koladi, Kolkali, Kambadi Kali and Kolaattam. Sticks one foot length are held in each hand and beaten to make a sharp, rasping sound as the dance {{proceeds}} with unique steps, twisting and turning. It is danced by both men and women, during festivals, auspicious days and weddings. The special qualities of the dance are quickness, alertness, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to hurt the other dancers by the swinging 'kol'. Earlier, the 'kols' were brightly painted and decorated with brass rings, bells etc. The dancers used to wear ankle-bells. However, no special dress or make up was used for this dance.|$|E
500|$|Suharto {{promoted}} his [...] "New Order", {{as opposed}} to Sukarno's [...] "Old Order", as a society based on the Pancasila ideology. After initially <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as basic principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as [...] "anti-Pancasila".|$|E

Nonetheless, he {{wanted to work with}} Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the concept upon visiting Hasbro. Bay considered the first draft [...] "too kiddie", so he increased the military's role in the story. The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to mix the brands. Bay based Lennox' struggle to get to the Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film.|$|E

If {{they are}} TD pipettes {{they should not}} be rinsed after they have delivered their contents. If the pipette were calibrated TC it should be rinsed to obtain the correct amount of material. If the fluid to be measured is quite viscous or sticky (such as glycerol solutions) the pipette must be calibrated and in this case the outside of the tip must be carefully wiped with a lint-free tissue to remove the adhering liquid - while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> to <b>not</b> touch the opening of the pipette tip, which may require some practice.

2500|$|It {{was during}} Gofraid's short reign over Dublin, on 6 May 1074, that Donatus, first {{archbishop}} of Dublin died. This led {{the archbishop of}} Canterbury, Lanfranc of Pavia, to {{take an interest in}} Irish matters. Lanfranc, basing himself, he said, on Bede's writings, had already assured Pope Alexander II that Dublin formed part of the province of Canterbury and that it was for him to consecrate the new bishop. He also wrote to the Irish kings concerned, <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to cause offence. His letter to Toirdelbach calls him [...] "magnificent king of Ireland", a title which might seem the more impressive had Lanfranc not also addressed Gofraid of Dublin as [...] "glorious king of Ireland".|$|E
2500|$|Political {{pressure}} on Barclay to give battle and the general's continuing reluctance {{to do so}} (viewed as intransigence by the Russian nobility) led to his removal. He was replaced in his position as commander-in-chief by the popular, veteran Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov. Kutuzov, however, continued much {{along the line of}} the general Russian strategy, fighting the occasional defensive engagement but <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to risk the army in an open battle. [...] Instead the Russian army fell back ever deeper into Russia's interior. Following a defeat at Smolensk on August 16–18 he continued the move east. Unwilling to give up Moscow without a fight, Kutuzov took up a defensive position some 75 miles before Moscow at Borodino.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} his {{criticism}} of the Origin, some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was [...] "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about". [...] "It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me". Owen also resorted to the same subterfuge he used against Mantell, writing another anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review in April 1860. In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to associate any particular comment with his own name. Owen did praise, however, the Origins description of Darwin's work on insect behavior and pigeon breeding as Huxley, Thomas H., (1861), [...] "On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals", Natural History Review 1: 67–84."real gems".|$|E
60|$|I marched off again, {{every once}} in a while {{stopping}} to take in some more water, and <b>being</b> very <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to step into the same shop twice, till night came on, and I found myself soaked through, for it had been raining more or less all day. As I went to the ship, I could not help thinking how lonesome it would be, to spend the whole night in that damp and dark forecastle, without light or fire, and nothing to lie on but the bare boards of my bunk. However, to drown all such thoughts, I gulped down another glass of water, though I was wet enough outside and in by this time; and trying to put on a bold look, as if I had just been eating a hearty meal, I stepped aboard the ship.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{cruise lines}} {{allocate}} cabins for dance host programs. Dance hosts {{are expected to}} socialize with passengers and dance with the female passengers, who happen to greatly outnumber male passengers on most cruises. Dance hosts must be present nightly at dance floor locations and [...] "work the room", offering a dance to each unescorted female passenger, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> to <b>not</b> to show favoritism.They are also responsible for attending all ship-sponsored parties and are often asked to host tables at dinner time. They serve as general companions, making conversation and joining in for shipboard activities and games. All the while, romance is not involved, so these gentlemen must have their wits and tact about them. Crossing another passenger's cabin threshold can result in disembarkation. The film Out to Sea, a comical interpretation of the position, is basically a guide of what not to do.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked for}} her in the knot of persons {{gathered}} round a past Prime Minister who was {{standing in the middle of}} the largest room discoursing in the genial, almost jovial, manner natural to him at these times. The two or three ladies forming his audience had been joined by another in black and white, and it was on her that Pierston's attention was directed, as well as the great statesman's, whose first sheer gaze at her, expressing 'Who are you?' almost audibly, changed into an interested, listening look as the few words she spoke were uttered--for the Minister differed from many of his standing in <b>being</b> extremely <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to interrupt a timid speaker, giving way in an instant if anybody else began with him. Nobody knew better than himself that all may learn, and his manner was that of an unconceited man who could catch an idea readily, even if he could not undertake to create one.|$|R

Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said he hoped he'd be ready by the season's opener, “At this point we’re going {{to err on the side}} of <b>being</b> real <b>careful</b> and <b>not</b> put them in a situation where (it’s) the last day of minicamp on June 13th and all of a sudden we have a foot injury," [...] said McDaniels."Hopefully, everybody will be ready by August.” ...|$|R
50|$|Another general {{approach}} is primarily associated with Michael Artin. Here {{the idea is}} to start with any object of the kind to be classified and study its deformation theory. This means first constructing infinitesimal deformations, then appealing to prorepresentability theorems to put these together into an object over a formal base. Next an appeal to Grothendieck's formal existence theorem provides an object of the desired kind over a base which is a complete local ring. This object can be approximated via Artin's approximation theorem by an object defined over a finitely generated ring. The spectrum of this latter ring can then be viewed as giving a kind of coordinate chart on the desired moduli space. By gluing together enough of these charts, we can cover the space, but the map from our union of spectra to the moduli space will in general be many to one. We therefore define an equivalence relation on the former; essentially, two points are equivalent if the objects over each are isomorphic. This gives a scheme and an equivalence relation, which is enough to define an algebraic space (actually an algebraic stack if we are <b>being</b> <b>careful)</b> if <b>not</b> always a scheme.|$|R

60|$|Well, I got on--got on very {{fairly and}} steadily, <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to venture {{out of my}} depth, and not to forget that small {{beginnings}} may lead in time to great ends. A prospect {{of one of those}} great ends--great, I mean, to such a small trader as I was at that period--showed itself to me when I had been some little time in business. In plain terms, I had a chance of joining in a first-rate transaction, which would give me profit, and position, and everything I wanted, provided I could qualify myself for engaging in it by getting good security beforehand for a very large amount.|$|E
50|$|Humphrey the Bear oversleeps {{through the}} opening of hunting season one year. While the other bears flee {{to the safety of}} their cave, Humphrey is left outside and is forced to hide in a nearby cabin instead. Once inside the cabin, Humphrey is horrified to learn that it is a hunting lodge, made evident by the many guns and hunting trophies hanging on the walls. As he starts to leave, he sees Donald Duck coming toward the cabin {{carrying}} a rifle. Humphrey desperately looks for a hiding place inside the cabin, and finally notices a large bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. He quickly rolls up the rug, stows it in an empty trunk, and lays out flat {{on the floor in the}} rug's place. Just then, Donald enters unaware that his rug has been replaced, or that it is alive. Humphrey nervously endures several uncomfortable and painful experiences, all the while <b>being</b> very <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to let Donald know that he is a real bear. These include hiccups, a burning ember from the fireplace falling on his fur, going through Donald's washer-dryer, and being mowed with a reel mower, among other things.|$|R

50|$|For {{removal of}} a small tumor, it is {{accessed}} through one nostril. However, for larger tumors, access through both nostrils is required and the posterior nasal septum must be removed. Then the surgeon slides the endoscope into the nasal choana until the sphenoid ostium is found. Then the mucosa around the ostium is cauterized for microadenomas and removed completely for macroadenomas. Then the endoscope enters the ostium and meets the sphenoid rostrum where the mucosa is retracted from this structure and {{is removed from the}} sphenoid sinus to open the surgical pathway. At this point, imaging and Doppler devices are used to define the important structures. Then the floor of the sella turcica is opened with a high speed drill <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> to <b>not</b> pierce the dura mater. Once the dura is visible, it is cut with microscissors for precision. If the tumor is small, the tumor can be removed by an en bloc procedure, which consists of cutting the tumor into many sections for removal. If the tumor is larger, the center of the tumor is removed first, then the back, then the sides, then top of the tumor {{to make sure that the}} arachnoid membrane does not expand into the surgical view. This will happen if the top part of the tumor is taken out too early. After tumor removal, CSF leaks are tested for with fluorescent dye, and if there are no leaks, the patient is closed.|$|R

And <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to awaken any of the little household, who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues, Kit left his money on the chimney-piece, with an inscription in chalk calling his mother's attention to the circumstance, and informing her that it came from her dutiful son; and went his way, with a heart something heavier than his pockets, but free from any very great oppression notwithstanding.|$|E

40|$|The idea that, {{within a}} family, one child prefers to act {{differently}} is {{a recurring theme}} in children’s books. This story features Mama Cat and her three kittens, Fluffy, Skinny, and Boris. Mama Cat does {{the things that you}} would expect a cat do, wash her paws, walk on stone walls, sharpen her claws, chase leaves, dig in sand, and take the proverbial “cat-nap. ” Fluffy and Skinny stay close to Mama Cat and copy what she does. Boris, on the other hand, seems to take little interest in Mama Cat’s activities – preferring to snooze. Eventually, Mama Cat, Fluffy, and Skinny tire – and now its Boris’s turn! The book ends with a playful plot twist that is sure to be a hit with the toddlers for whom the book is intended. The book’s simple phrases break down the action, using repetition to lead children to anticipate the next event. When being read out loud, the reader can easily engage children to participate by asking them what they think will happen next. This approach will add drama and heighten the enjoyment of the surprise ending. Beautifully illustrated (covered more in detail later in this paper), each picture not only features the cats, but contains trios of other creatures including: caterpillars, ladybugs, snails, and bumblebees.

50|$|After {{losing his}} {{building}} job after being caught stealing materials Barry and Terry becomes involved with shady gangster character Tommy McArdle. In his early appearances, McArdle drops {{by the close}} unannounced to get Barry and Terry {{to do a job}} for him requesting, for instance, they valet his car to rid the back seat of what McArdle described as 'pig's blood'. In a stronger storyline, (and one of Brooksides first sensational ones) under instructions from Tommy McArdle the two provide an alibi for the perpetrators of an armed robbery. Local fireman and neighbour George Jackson is convicted for this crime instead, the key evidence being that he (foolishly) drew a map of the warehouse for McArdle, who used him for his knowledge of the place. In another scam, Barry and Terry enter in a counterfeit video deal with McArdle, (which also sees Barry briefly involved with Lucy Collins - daughter of residents Paul and Annabelle). This particular job goes wrong for Barry; despite <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> to <b>not</b> cross McArdle it ends in the beating of Barry and Terry within an inch of their lives in the tool hire shop that they run. Barry typically makes a quick recovery, but Terry is seriously hurt and spends a long time in hospital and for a while afterwards walks with a limp. The McArdle beating one is too much for Barry to try to get revenge on and so sensing he has no friends or future in Liverpool, Barry takes a job as a shop fitter, a job that takes him all around the country.|$|R
40|$|One of the paradoxes facing {{all mankind}} is its {{inability}} to supply the world population with enough healthful, nutritious food, although it has the technological, human, and financial ability to do so. Today, the world has more resources and know-how and is better armed than ever to attack the problems posed by infectious diseases, low productivity, and lack of energy sources and nonpolluting means of transportation, {{as well as the}} absence of basic services, such as potable water, sanitary facilities, schools, and health care infrastructures. The basic question is how best to use these resources and skills to further reduce the number of individuals living in extreme poverty, more than 1. 2 billion people. This paradox is the basis for this study on the challenge of hunger in West Africa and the regional strategies that must be used in the end to achieve food security in this region. Food and nutritional security remain one of the basic challenges in West Africa that we must face. The whole question is how to meet this challenge.
