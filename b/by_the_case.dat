5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, {{which is much more}} sensitive than the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Christine Collins {{was placed}} in Los Angeles County Hospital by Captain Jones. After her release, she sued the police {{department}} twice, winning the second lawsuit. Although Captain Jones was ordered to pay Collins $10,800, he never did. A city council welfare hearing recommended that Jones and Chief of Police James E. Davis leave their posts, but both were later reinstated. The California State Legislature later made it illegal {{for the police to}} commit someone to a psychiatric facility without a warrant. Northcott was convicted of the murders of Lewis Winslow (12), Nelson Winslow (10) and an unidentified Mexican boy; after his conviction, Northcott was reported to have admitted to up to 20 murders, though he later denied the claim. Northcott was executed by hanging in 1930 at the age of 23. Sarah Louise was convicted of Walter Collins' murder and served almost 12 years in prison. In 1930, the residents of Wineville changed the town's name to Mira Loma to escape the notoriety brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E

5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|Webster went {{on trial}} at the Central Criminal Court– the Old Bailey– on 2 July 1879. In {{a sign of}} the great public {{interest}} aroused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General, Sir Hardinge Giffard. Webster was defended by a prominent London barrister, Warner Sleigh, and the case was presided over by Mr. Justice Denman. The trial was just as well-attended as the earlier hearings in Richmond and attracted intense interest from all levels of society; on the fourth day of the trial, the Crown Prince of Sweden– the future King Gustaf V– turned up to watch the proceedings.|$|E

25|$|This {{is in fact}} a type of gapped {{relative}} clause, but {{is distinguished}} {{by the fact that the}} role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> marking of the marker (the relative pronoun) used to join the main and embedded clauses.

25|$|One {{story of}} solar eclipse danger was {{illustrated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Mr. Tomososki, who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse, leaving {{him with a}} pea-sized blind spot {{for the rest of}} his life. During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did. While some can recover, the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to not look at the sun.|$|E

On 22 March 1945, the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, announced that a public inquiry would be held into the case. Sir Walter Monckton KC was appointed to conduct the inquiry.|$|E

Not long ago her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot.

25|$|The {{legitimacy}} of the subcell structure came from the recruitment process, originally <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> officer {{and then by the}} cell leaders. Sometimes, the cell leader would propose subcell member names to the case officer, so the case officer could have a headquarters name check run before bringing the individual into the subcell. In principle, however, the subcell members would know ALPINE, and sometimes {{the other members of the}} ALPINE cell if they needed to work together; if ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 had independent assignments, they might not know each other. ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 certainly would not know ALASTAIR or anyone in the ALTITUDE or ALLOVER cells.|$|E
25|$|Drs Dayun Tao and Prapa Sripichitt, {{working at}} the Department of Agronomy, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, made {{numerous}} crosses between rice and wild, rhizomatous species. The difficulty of this work is illustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the single successful hybrid they obtained between Oryza sativa and O. longistaminata. To get this one plant, 119 rice florets were pollinated, which produced 51 seeds. Of these seeds, 33 had culturable embryos, and {{only one of these}} embryos developed into a viable plant. Put another way, this hybridization was relatively easy: over 3000 pollinations had to be made between rice and O. rhizomatis to get a single viable plant. It was a fortunate cross in other respects: the hybrid was healthy and rhizomatous (it is still alive) and partially fertile, allowing F2 seed to be obtained.|$|E

25|$|Natural justice {{principles}} {{originated from}} the procedural elements of due process, {{but it is}} uncertain if substantive elements of due process are accepted in local law yet. Ong Ah Chuan is said to adopt the idea of procedural fairness. In the procedural model, courts go beyond a mere assessment of formal validity and inquire into the procedural fairness of legal processes. In Singapore, the current legal position is somewhere between the formal model as evidenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor (1995), and the procedural model evidenced by Ong Ah Chuan. In Jabar, the Court of Appeal held that a law is valid and binding {{as long as it}} has been validly passed by Parliament. Consequently, whether the law is fair, just and reasonable does not matter.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} sources for the scare was Michelle Remembers, a 1980 book by the Canadian {{psychiatrist}} Lawrence Pazder in which he detailed what he claimed were the repressed memories of his patient (and wife) Michelle Smith. Smith had claimed that as a child she had been abused by her family in Satanic rituals in which babies were sacrificed and Satan himself appeared. In 1983, allegations were made that the McMartin family—owners of a preschool in California—were guilty of sexually abusing the children in their care during Satanic rituals. The allegations resulted in a lengthy and expensive trial, in which all of the accused would eventually be cleared. The publicity generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> resulted in similar allegations being made in various {{other parts of the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|From 1940–1991, Latvia was {{occupied}} by Soviet Union, and all previous regulations and practices were over-ruled by the Communist Regime. Due to Soviet ideals on policing whereby criminals were the enemy, {{a high level of}} institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist power ideologies. During this time, a clear imbalance existed between police actions and the rights of citizens. Despite lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue. This is illustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where former head of police Alfons Noviks was sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide against the Latvian people during this period.|$|E
