30|$|The {{presence}} of gender stereotypes and sexism and the Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB) theory suggest that abstract terms {{would be more}} likely to be used to describe positive aspects in the <b>biographies</b> <b>of</b> men than in <b>biographies</b> <b>of</b> women. Similarly, abstract language {{would be more likely}} to describe negative aspects in the <b>biographies</b> <b>of</b> women in comparison to <b>biographies</b> <b>of</b> men. We test this hypothesis first through a chi-square test on the aggregated ratios of adjectives over positive and negative words in all <b>biographies</b> <b>of</b> each gender. To test if the bias appears at the individual level, we then focus on biographies with at least 250 words and one evaluative term, testing if the measured r_+ and r_- depends on gender while controlling for professions and the century in which a person was born.|$|R
