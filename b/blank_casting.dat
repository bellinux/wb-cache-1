[...] Funding {{for the film}} came in part from Coscarelli's father; additional funding came from doctors and lawyers. His mother designed some of the special effects, costumes, and make-up. [...] The cast and crew were composed mainly of friends and aspiring professionals. Due to their inexperience, they {{did not realize that}} firing blanks could be dangerous; Coscarelli's jacket caught fire from a shotgun <b>blank.</b> <b>Casting</b> was based on previous films that Coscarelli directed, and he created roles for those actors. [...] Because he could not afford to hire an editor or cameraman, Coscarelli did these duties himself.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{mathematical}} model for thermal transfer and solidification of beam <b>blank</b> <b>casting</b> has been established, which is solved by FEM. A dynamic secondary cooling control model is developed accordingly, {{and it can}} meet the need of online calculation for the entire temperature field of the beam <b>blank</b> <b>casting,</b> in which {{the amount of water}} for secondary cooling is set up and optimized by using effective casting speed and target surface temperature strategy. The dynamic secondary cooling control system is programmed by using Visual C++ 6. 0 with friendly operation interface, which can be adopted not only for the online cooling control of beam <b>blank</b> <b>casting</b> but possibly for lab calculation of water table as well...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, I coin {{the term}} 'casting off blanks' {{to refer to}} a {{procedure}} often used in manuscript construction in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: the practice of leaving several pages of a manuscript blank in order to create distinct sections into which to copy an as yet undecided number of texts. I describe the types of manuscript in which <b>blank</b> <b>casting</b> off tends to occur, the main forms it takes and methods for detecting it. In {{the second half of the}} article, I examine specific manuscripts in which <b>blank</b> <b>casting</b> off seems to have been used, often without the knowledge of modern editors and critics, focusing in particular detail on Anne Southwell's 'commonplace book' (Folger Shakespeare Library MS Vb. 198.

The intensity of heat dissipation for individual nozzles cannot be practically determined directly on the casting machine therefore it is investigated on a laboratory model of the Department of Thermal Engineering. A physical quantity that characterizes transport of heat from a surface is the heat transfer coefficient whose size depends on several operational parameters. This contribution describes determination of the heat transfer coefficient on a hot physical model. An inversion method, based on the measuring of heat gradient between two thermocouples placed {{on the body of}} a hot probe, has been used for the calculation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{aluminium}} blank {{green sand}} (green) casting process was optimized by using Taguchi's robust design approach. An {{attempt was made}} to obtain optimal settings of two groups of aluminium blank sand casting processes. Single aluminium blank sand casting and double aluminium blanks sand casting for process robustness comparison. The casting process involves a number of parameters affecting various casting quality features of the product. In order to optimize the process seven control factors viz., grain size, clay content, moisture content, ramming, sprue size, riser size, and diameter to thickness (D/t) ratio of the blank were selected. Each factor was considered at three levels. For this study three uncontrollable (or noise) factors viz. metal flow rate, pouring temperature and humidity were identified. To capture the effect of noise factors casting yield, surface defects, and casting density for single and double castings were measured. An orthogonal array was constructed for the seven factors undertaken, and performing eighteen sets of experiments with their replicates generated the data. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio s were calculated based on the design of experiments. The average values of S/N ratios for each factor at three levels were calculated and were plotted on the graph. Considering the maximum S/N ratios from the graph, the optimum levels of process factors for both single and double castings were obtained. A statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to see which process parameters are statistically significant. A verification experiment was performed using the identified optimum conditions. The results have shown that single aluminium blanks and casting process is more robust than double aluminium blank sand casting process. This proved that single aluminium blank sand casting process had shown better insensitivity to noise factors. The experimental results confirmed the validity of used Taguchi robust design method for enhancing sand casting process and optimizing the sand casting parameters in aluminium <b>blank</b> <b>casting</b> process...|$|E

50|$|For the 60-inch telescope, George Ellery Hale {{received}} the 60 in mirror <b>blank,</b> <b>cast</b> by Saint-Gobain in France, in 1896 {{as a gift}} from his father, William Hale.

Grinding began in 1905 and took two years. The mounting and structure for the telescope was built in San Francisco and barely survived the 1906 earthquake. Transporting the pieces to the top of Mount Wilson was an enormous task. First light was December 8, 1908. It was at the time the largest operational telescope in the world. Lord Rosse's Leviathan of Parsonstown, a 72-inch (1.8-meter) telescope built in 1845, was, by the 1890s, out of commission.|$|R

40|$|Analysis of Marseille bronze {{using the}} fast neutron {{activation}} using a cyclotron {{show that the}} lead content could vary from 1 5 % to 24 % within a same monetary series. The {{aim of this study}} is to check if these variations are due to a voluntary change in the alloy component or to a natural lead segregation on the mould during the casting process. To cast double sesterces bronze blanks, we have recreated a limestone mould. This mould was made in the same way that the one recovered at the gallo-roman site of Châteaubleau (IIIe c. A. D.). Due to the high lead content of the blank and to their thickness (6 mm), self absorption of gamma ray on the alloy prevents precise determination of lead content. In order to correct self absorption we build a model based on calculation of a corrective factor.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the casting process and the wear of the mould {{as well as the}} quality of the product depend strongly on the mould design. This is particularly true when considering the production of beam blanks. If the mould is too tight, thermal contraction can generate considerable contact forces between the product and the mould on the inner surfaces of the flanges. If it is not tight enough, the thermal coupling between the mould and the beam blank is not sufficient to allow the solidification of a skin of the required thickness upon exit from the mould. A finite element model was developed to assist in the mould design. This model takes both the thermal and mechanical interaction between the mould and the product into account. The effect of solidification is implicitly included in the (thermal) finite element formulation while the ferro-static pressure is applied by the means of a specially developed element. The model was applied to a medium gage beam <b>blank</b> <b>cast</b> at ProfilARBED Differdange. The skin thickness as well as the localisation of the wear of the mould predicted by the model are in good agreement with observations made in industrial practice. ...|$|R
