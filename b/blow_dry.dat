500|$|The final {{was played}} on 23 March 2003 at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg. This {{was the fifth}} match to be played at {{the ground in the}} tournament. The match, watched by a crowd of 31,779, began at 10:00 SAST. Simon Wilde, writing for the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, said the venue was one of the [...] "most bountiful" [...] grounds for batsmen. However, on that day the pitch was moist and the outfield was damp {{as a result of the}} {{thunderstorms}} the previous evening. A short shower that morning forced the ground staff to <b>blow</b> <b>dry</b> air over the pitch. The sky was overcast with a chance of further rainfall. For the umpires—David Shepherd and Steve Bucknor—it was their third World Cup Final. Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden were appointed as the third and fourth umpires, respectively. Former Sri Lankan cricketer Ranjan Madugalle served as the match referee.|$|E

30|$|The SERS {{substrate}} {{was prepared}} as follows: gold nanoplate solution was drop-casted onto a clean silicon substrate. The substrate was rinsed and <b>blown</b> <b>dry</b> by nitrogen gas.

The PC surface morphology was measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM- 6360 LV, Japan).

Before ALD films were applied, the knives were cleaned by immersion in ultrasonic baths of (all reagent grade) trichloroethylene, acetone, methanol and isopropanol, followed by a deionized water rinse and <b>blow</b> <b>drying</b> with N 2 gas.|$|R
50|$|Fume bluing {{is another}} process similar to rust bluing.

50|$|Coastal {{sand dunes}} are found just inland from a beach, and are formed {{as the wind}} <b>blows</b> <b>dry</b> sand inland beyond the beach. It follows that this can only happen {{when there is an}} area of {{reasonably}} flat land inland from the beach. In time, this rather inhospitable surface will be colonised by pioneer species. These species (e.g. marram grass) will stabilise the dunes and prevent them moving any more. The process of plant succession will eventually see these dunes converted to woodland (depending on the climate) and a mature soil will have formed.|$|R
50|$|High-tech {{toilet seats}} may include many features, {{including}} a heated seat, a bidet, and a <b>blow</b> <b>drier.</b> High-tech seats are {{most common in}} Japan, where a seat with integrated bidets is colloquially called a Washlet, after a leading brand. Electrically heated toilet seats have been popular in Japan since the 1970s. Since Japanese bathrooms are often unheated, the toilet seat sometimes doubles as a space heater. Integrated bidets date from around 1980, and have since become very popular in Japan, and are becoming more common in most other developed countries.|$|R
