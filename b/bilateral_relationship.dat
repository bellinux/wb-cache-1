5|$|From 1921, {{the country}} had {{negotiated}} the Little Entente with Romania and Czechoslovakia {{in the face of}} Hungarian designs on its territory, and after a decade of bilateral treaties, had formalised the arrangements in 1933. This had been followed the following year by the Balkan Entente of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, aimed at thwarting Bulgarian aspirations. Throughout this period, the Yugoslav government had sought to remain good friends with France, seeing her as a guarantor of European peace treaties. This was formalised through a treaty of friendship signed in 1927. With these arrangements in place, Italy posed the biggest problem for Yugoslavia, funding the anti-Yugoslav Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation which promoted Bulgarian irredentism. Attempts by King Alexander to negotiate with Benito Mussolini fell on deaf ears, and after Alexander's assassination, nothing of note happened on that front until 1937. In the aftermath of Alexander's assassination, Yugoslavia was isolated both militarily and diplomatically, and reached out to France to assist its <b>bilateral</b> <b>relationship</b> with Italy.|$|E

40|$|According {{to capital}} {{structure}} literature, <b>bilateral</b> <b>relationships</b> with external partners {{have a strong}} impact on a firm’s financing decisions because they involve relation-specific investments that would lose most of their value in case of liquidation. By adjusting their capital structure firms can reduce liquidation risks and incentive their partners to undertake such investments. In this paper we extend these arguments to strategic alliances {{in the context of}} biotechnology industry, where <b>bilateral</b> <b>relationships</b> are formed to advance the commercialization of innovation and R-S investments are a primary issue. We investigate alliances heterogeneity and analyze whether partnerships possessing different characteristics exert a different impact on capital structure. We find that capital structure implications are relevant only for biotech firms placing a long-term strategic emphasis on the use of alliances. Moreover, this relation is especially important for agreements focused on R&D activities and signed with downstream players. These results confirm the importance of capital structure decisions in <b>bilateral</b> <b>relationships</b> and add to previous literature by clarifying when these decisions are more valuable in the context of strategic alliances formation...|$|R
