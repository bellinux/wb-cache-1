Four different types of greases were tested in a ball/spherical roller-on-disc machine, where the film thickness was measured using the interferometry method, varying the temperature, load, and slip. The test results show that there are two lubrication regimes. Below a transition speed the grease thickener plays an important role where the film thickness increases with decreasing speed. At higher speeds the film thickness is primarily governed by the base oil. This transition speed {{is a function of the}} temperature and not of the load and slip.

Case studies of optimal design are conducted for different mass ratio as well as linear combination of objective function and its consequence reveals that global optimum of balance shaft model is existed over possible design conditions.
