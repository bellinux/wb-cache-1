5|$|Iridium in bulk {{metallic}} form is not biologically {{important or}} hazardous to health {{due to its}} lack of reactivity with tissues; {{there are only about}} 20parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue. Like most metals, finely divided iridium powder can <b>be</b> <b>hazardous</b> to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of iridium compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could <b>be</b> <b>hazardous</b> due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could <b>be</b> <b>hazardous</b> due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself. Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD50 value of 2800mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD50 of 280mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can <b>be</b> <b>hazardous</b> to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E

25|$|Traveling by bike {{along the}} ocean can <b>be</b> <b>hazardous.</b> Only a short {{section in the}} {{downtown}} area has sidewalks. The roads along the ocean are narrow and have small or no shoulders, making biking a potentially dangerous activity in those areas.|$|E
