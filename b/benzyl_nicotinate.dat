40|$|The {{degradation}} of <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> {{in aqueous solution}} over a pH range of 2. 0 - 10. 0 at 50 &# 177; 0. 2 o was studied. The degradation was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The degradation was observed to follow apparent first-order rate kinetics and the rate constant for the decomposition at 25 o was estimated by extrapolation. The reaction was shown to be hydroxide ion catalyzed and the Arrhenius plots showed the temperature dependence of <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> degradation. A {{significant increase in the}} stability of <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> was observed when glycerol or polyethylene glycol 400 was incorporated into the aqueous solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{performance of}} <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (BN) on corrosion of {{cold rolled steel}} (CRS) in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution has been investigated using weight loss, Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The BN acts as mixed type inhibitor. The thermodynamic parameters indicate the comprehensive nature adsorption of BN on CRS which obey Langmuir isotherm. Morphological investigation of corrosion inhibition is carried out using AFM and optical microscopic studies support the formation of inhibitor film on CRS. There is a good agreement between the values of weight loss measurements and electrochemical studies. Â </p...|$|E
40|$|N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), {{generated}} by electrochemical reduction under galvanostatic control of 1, 3 -dialkylimidazolium-based ionic liquids, were employed as catalysts in transesterification reactions in the parent, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as solvents, without the utilisation of any {{volatile organic solvent}} or base. The reaction between isopropenyl or ethyl acetate and an alcohol (not efficient {{in the absence of}} catalyst) was induced by the presence of an electrogenerated NHC, which seems to assist the proton transfer from the alcohol to the ester, yielding the corresponding acetate. The reaction also proceeds with methyl nicotinate as starting ester and 2 -(diethylamino) ethanol or benzyl alcohol as alcohols and leads to the corresponding biologically active compounds, nicametate and <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate,</b> in good yields. All products were isolated in good to excellent yields and complete recyclability of the ionic liquid as solvent has been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{mammalian}} skin is {{a barrier}} that effectively separates the water-rich interior of the body from the normally dryer exterior. Changes in the external conditions, for example ambient humidity, {{have been shown to}} affect the skin barrier properties. The prime objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of water activity of a topical formulation on skin hydration and permeability. A second objective was to gain more understanding on how two commonly used humectants, urea and glycerol, affect skin barrier function in vivo. METHODS: Simple aqueous formulations were applied under occlusion to the volar forearm of healthy volunteers. Following 4 -h exposure, skin water loss (by transepidermal water loss measurements), skin hydration (by Corneometry) and skin permeability (by time to vasodilation due to <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> exposure) were monitored. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that a relatively small change in the water activity of a topical formulation is sufficient to induce considerable effects on stratum corneum hydration and permeability to exogenous substances. Exposing the skin to high water activity leads to increased skin hydration and also increased permeability. Furthermore, urea and glycerol promote skin hydration and permeability even at reduced water activity of the applied formulation. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of considering the water activity in topically applied formulations and the potential benefit of using humectants. The results may impact formulation optimization in how to facilitate skin hydration and to modify skin permeability by temporarily open and close the skin barrier...|$|E
40|$|New and {{improved}} drug delivery systems are the important {{subject of much}} scientific research. The development of formulations that increase skin oxygenation and of methods for measuring oxygen levels in skin are important for dealing with healing processes affected by the level of oxygen. We have use EPR oximetry in vivo to compare the influence of liposomal formulations of different size and composition with that of hydrogel {{with respect to the}} action of the entrapped <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (BN). Following the topical application of BN onto the skin of mice, pO 2 increase was measured by low-frequency EPR as a function of time. The effect of BN was evaluated by 3 different parameters: lag-time, time needed for maximum pO 2 increase, and overall effectiveness expressed by the area under the response-time curve. An increase in skin oxygenation was observed after BN application. The results show that the effect of BN incorporated in liposomes is achieved more rapidly than the effect from hydrophilic gel. The composition of the liposomes significantly affects the time at which BN starts to act and, to a lesser extent, the maximum increase of pO 2 in skin and the effectiveness of BN action. However, the size of the liposomes influences both the effectiveness of BN action and the time at which BN starts to act. After repeated application of liposomes, the pO 2 baseline increased and the response of the skin tissue was faster. Our results demonstrate that EPR oximetry is a useful method for evaluating oxygen changes after drug application and for following the time course of their action...|$|E
40|$|Tumor hypoxia is a {{well known}} {{therapeutic}} problem which contributes to radio resistance and aggressive tumor characteristics. Lack of techniques for repeated measurements of tumor oxygenation (pO(2), partial pressure of oxygen) has restricted the optimization of hypoxia modifying methods and their efficacious application with radiotherapy. We have investigated a non-invasivemethod to enhance tissue pO(2) of peripheral tumors using topical application of formulations with BN (<b>Benzyl</b> <b>Nicotinate),</b> a vasodilator, and have used EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) oximetry to follow its effect on tumor oxygenation. We incorporated 2. 5 % BN in both hydrogel and microemulsions and investigated the effects on pO(2) of subcutaneous RIF- 1 (Radiation Induced Fibrosarcoma) tumors in C 3 H mice. The experiments were repeated for five consecutive days. The topical application of BN in hydrogel led to a significant increase from a pre-treatment pO(2) of 9. 3 mmHg to 11 - 16 mmHg at 30 - 50 min on day 1. However, the magnitude {{and the time of}} significant increase in pO(2) decreased with repeated topical applications. The BN in a microemulsion resulted in a significant increase from a baseline pO(2) of 8. 8 mmHg to 13 - 18 mmHg at 10 - 50 min on day 1. Experiments repeated on subsequent days showed a decline in the magnitude of pO(2) increase on repeated applications. No significant change in tumor pO(2) was observed in experiments with formulations without BN (vehicle only). EPR oximetry was successfully used to follow the temporal changes in tumor pO(2) during repeated applications for five consecutive days. This approach can be potentially used to enhance radiotherapeutic outcome by scheduling radiation doses when an increase in tumor pO(2) is observed after topical applications of BN formulations...|$|E
40|$|Attenuated total {{reflectance}} Fourier transform (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and ATR-FTIR {{spectroscopic imaging}} {{was used for}} the in vitro monitoring of the mechanisms of drug permeation and the effects of penetration enhancers on silicone membrane and human stratum corneum (SC). Simulated spectroscopic imaging data sets were used to validate the scope and application of quantitative iterative target transformation factor analysis (QITTFA) which is a variant of target factor analysis (TFA) in the presence of instrumental noise and collinearity. The results show that QITTFA is robust in the presence of noise levels up to 35 %. The flexibility in the implementation and execution of the QITTFA approaches enabled the analysis of spectroscopic data even {{with a high degree of}} collinearity. It was deduced that the use of percentage % negativity values of calculated permeation profiles and R-values between target and predicted spectrum provided a good indication of the quality of target testing. These parameters can be used to estimate the accuracy of the extracted distribution and evolution profiles. Permeation experiments were conducted to monitor the effects of ethanol, octanol, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and isopropyl myristate (IPM) on a model compound, 4 -cyanophenol (CNP) across silicone membrane and human SC. The application of the developed multivariate analytical strategy to analyse ATR-FTIR spectroscopic data of the SC experiments allowed a semi-quantitative determination of permeation profiles of CNP administered from ethanol, octanol, PEG 400 and IPM across SC as well as solvent membrane interactions. The ability of QITTFA to simultaneously investigate major SC and formulation components was demonstrated. This opens up the possibility to study the effects of solvents on SC lipids and proteins on molecular level in situ. ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging experiments of two model formulations; (I) CNP in PEG 600 +water and (II) <b>benzyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (BN) in a PEG 400 +ethanol+water across SC were conducted to acquire further understanding of the heterogeneity of skin and the mechanism of drug permeation. The image analysis demonstrated the ability to simultaneously map distributions of major SC and formulation components. As such these distributions maps can be used to investigate affinities of drug solvent to the lipid rich and lipid poor skin domains during permeation. The results show that ATIR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging permeation experiments together with QITTFA allows the simultaneous in situ monitoring of both spatial and time domain profiles of several components of a highly complex sample in a dynamic and flexible manner. The obtained information will help to probe mechanisms of drug permeation and the influence of penetration enhancers on these mechanisms at a molecular level.
