5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
25|$|As {{the system}} was being developed, a further {{improvement}} was introduced that allowed for continuous following as opposed to periodic re-setting. The switching system was modified such that the range {{was sent to the}} upper line for 2.5milliseconds (ms), and the range and radiogoniometer signals for 7.5ms. If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce a single bright <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, a faint second blip would appear to smear out the upper trace, noticeable even before the <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower trace became visible.|$|E
5000|$|Basic radars present <b>the</b> target {{information}} <b>on</b> {{a display}} and displayed targets {{are referred to}} as <b>blips.</b> Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relative size of <b>the</b> <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display, a radar operator could determine large targets from small targets. When a blip enhancing technique is used, small targets returns are augmented to look like large targets.|$|R
50|$|Later systems {{modified}} the time base {{to include a}} second signal that periodically produced <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display, providing a clock signal that varied with the time base and thus {{did not need to}} be aligned. In UK terminology, these were known as strobes.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "closest" [...] {{peripheral}} ties involve {{mutual recognition}} and repeated interactions (in one another’s physical presence or online). A treasured accountant or a cherished priest might be among one’s closest consequential strangers. At {{the other extreme}} are relationships that are barely <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social radar, such as people with adjoining season seats for a game or same-time-next-year conventioneers.|$|R
25|$|In testing, it {{was found}} that the faint range-only signal became hard to see when the signal was noisy and jumping about. A final change added a slight fixed delay to the range-only signal, causing its trace to shift to the right. Now three {{distinct}} blips appeared on the elevation display, the range <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, and the two elevation signals aligned vertically just to the left.|$|E
25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing a spot, or <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|E
25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of <b>the</b> <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> displays. If the blip was slightly longer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right than {{left side of the}} azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{successful}} deployment of radar systems for air defence during World War II, combatants were immediately {{confronted with the}} difficulty of distinguishing friendly aircraft from hostile ones; by that time, aircraft were flown at high speed and altitude, making visual identification impossible, and the targets showed up as featureless <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radar screen.This led to incidents such as the [...] "battle of Barking Creek", over Britain,and the [...] "air attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fortress of Koepenick", over Germany.|$|R
5000|$|Ground Control {{tracked the}} Scorpion and the {{unidentified}} object as two [...] "blips" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radar screen. <b>The</b> two <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radar screen grew closer and closer, until {{they seemed to}} merge as one (return). Assuming that Moncla had flown either under or over the target, Ground Control anticipated that moments later, the Scorpion and the object would again appear as two separate blips. Donald Keyhoe reported {{that there was a}} fear that the two objects had struck one another [...] "as if in a smashing collision." ...|$|R
25|$|Anthony {{commuted}} to Towson Catholic High School for {{his first}} three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and {{made a name for himself}} in the area, being named The Baltimore Suns metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention, and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was {{the most}} {{respected}} movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, his own reputation was not strong. Biographer James Curtis writes: [...] "Tracy was scarcely a <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more". He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving G.

500|$|Dana Stevens of Slate states, [...] "If 300, the new battle epic {{based on}} the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, {{had been made in}} Germany in the mid-1930s, it would be studied today {{alongside}} The Eternal Jew as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war. Since it's a product of the post-ideological, post-Xbox 21st century, 300 will instead be talked about as a technical achievement, the next <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> increasingly blurry line between movies and video games.|$|E

50|$|Using {{this method}} of {{operation}} greatly reduced the workload for the navigator. For much of the mission he simply had to keep <b>the</b> <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper trace aligned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display, and then periodically watch the lower blips for timing. Additionally, due to the measurements always being measured as direct lines from the station, as opposed to hyperbolic curves, the accuracy fell off linearly instead of with the square of distance. Gee-H could this guide the bomber to within 120 yards over Germany, a dramatic improvement over Gee's approximately 1 mile accuracy at the same distance.|$|R
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, the length of <b>the</b> <b>blips</b> depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long <b>blip</b> to appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper trace, and none <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of}} the fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter <b>blips,</b> one <b>on</b> either side of the centreline.|$|R
2500|$|In a November 19, 2015 radio {{interview}} with Hugh Hewitt, Palin {{was asked about}} the legalization of recreational marijuana in Alaska, to which Palin responded, [...] "We've got that libertarian streak in us, and I grew up in Alaska when pot was legal anyway. It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And I still believe that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.' Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'" ...|$|E

50|$|On Cold War era radar {{displays}} and before, CRT screen phosphor coatings were chosen {{because of their}} half life. This half life was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of more than ten seconds, or more than one complete rotation of the radar. This meant that the display would show the latest returns from a given object as a bright blip, and older ones as somewhat dimmer dots, as they faded. One might expect three or four such <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scanning speed of the antenna.

50|$|<b>On</b> board <b>the</b> aircraft, {{the signals}} from the three {{stations}} were received {{and sent to the}} 'A-type' display.

25|$|In contrast, the spiral-can {{system was}} {{essentially}} a rotating version of a conventional A-scope display.
