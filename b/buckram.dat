His kickoff return yardage surpassed the ACC single-season record {{that he had}} set the previous year. Smith finished the season ranked sixth {{in the nation in}} all-purpose yards. He was one of two players, alongside Donald <b>Buckram</b> of UTEP, to record more than 260all-purpose yards in three games. Smith led the team in receptions, receiving yards and return yards. Smith's 2,192all-purpose yards were the second-most ever recorded by an ACC player behind only C. J. Spiller of Clemson.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{also began}} to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a {{stiffened}} decorative bodice worn {{on top of another}} bodice stiffened with <b>buckram,</b> reeds, canes, whalebone or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the Victorian era, but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.|$|E
25|$|Bonnets {{could be}} made {{of a variety of}} materials. Bonnets formed from <b>buckram</b> and wire and covered with fashion fabric were very popular. During the warmer seasons, bonnets made of straw, woven horsehair, or {{gathered}} net were also seen. Heavier materials like velvet were favored for winter bonnets, though quilted winter hoods were much more practical and warm.|$|E

50|$|UTEP (3-4, 2-1) {{came out}} strong, leading 13-0 {{after the first}} quarter, thanks to Vittatoe's {{touchdown}} and field goals from Logan Barrett. But the Miners didn't score again until <b>Buckram's</b> TDs in the fourth quarter, watching as Tulsa scored 24 straight points.|$|R
500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich deemed the episode {{a tribute to}} Lady Gaga's [...] "genius", explaining that the costumes the characters wear are not exact replicas of Gaga's, giving the impression the glee club members made them themselves. Rachel wears two dresses, the first inspired by Gaga's Kermit the Frog dress and the second based on Gaga's silver mirrored triangle dress. Murphy selected Tina to wear the Hussein Chalayan–inspired bubble dress, which Eyrich adapted into a vest {{to make it easier}} to take on and off. Kurt's costume is inspired by the Alexander McQueen outfit Gaga wears in the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] video, described by Colfer as [...] "George Washington meets an Oceanic whale disco ball type thing". Eyrich strove for authenticity in replicating McQueen's ten-inch 'Armadillo' platforms. She was unable to buy a pair to fit Colfer, as they were not made in large enough sizes. Quinn wears the Armani Privé orbit dress Gaga wore to the 52nd Grammy Awards, fitted around her pregnant stomach. The most complicated costume was the Philip Treacy lobster hat, worn by Brittany (Heather Morris), as to get it to stay in place during the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] dance, Eyrich had to build a <b>Buckram</b> orb which could be safety–pinned on her head, then solder steel tentacles onto the sphere. It took 45 minutes to get the hat on and off Morris each day, and restricted her vision to what was directly in front of her. In solidarity with Kurt, Finn wears a vinyl floor–length red dress, based on the latex Atsuko Kudo dress Gaga wore to meet Elizabeth II. Mercedes wears a glittery bodysuit and a purple hair bow and wig, and Santana wears the Jeffrey Bryant lace bodysuit, and black rose Charlie Le Mindu hat, with lace airbrushed onto her face. As mentioned in the episode, members of Vocal Adrenaline wear red Chantilly lace full-body outfits and headpieces (as well as blonde wigs) inspired by the Fall 1998 Alexander McQueen dress Gaga wore whilst accepting her award for Best New Artist at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Writing about Burrowes in the 1966 Guyana Independence Issue of New World, Locke {{describes}} {{how he was}} constantly engaged in [...] "technical exploration", including making his own paints from unlikely ingredients and conducting experiments [...] "with balata, <b>buckram,</b> tailor's canvas, rice bags, bitumen, concrete and ... clay mixed with molasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding to {{fabrics and}} {{materials}} for the clothes construction, only Royalty were permitted to wear ermine. Other nobles (lesser ones) were allowed only to wear foxes and otters. Clothes worn during this era were mostly inspired by geometric shapes, probably derived from the high interest in science and mathematics from that era. [...] "Padding and quilting together {{with the use of}} whalebone or <b>buckram</b> for stiffening purposes were used to gain geometric effect with emphasis on giving the illusion of a small waist".|$|E
50|$|<b>Buckram's</b> {{two touchdowns}} were the final {{scores of the}} game, one coming with 6:25 left to play {{and the other a}} 3-yard run with less than 30 seconds left. Junior quarterback Trevor Vittatoe threw for 271 yards, {{including}} one touchdown—an 80-yard pass to Donovan Kemp in the first quarter.|$|R
60|$|THERE was {{no return}} to the subject. Dick and his father were {{henceforth}} on terms of coldness. The upright old gentleman grew more upright when he met his son, <b>buckrammed</b> with immortal anger; he asked after Dick's health, and discussed {{the weather and the}} crops with an appalling courtesy; his pronunciation was POINT-DE-VICE, his voice was distant, distinct, and sometimes almost trembling with suppressed indignation.|$|R
50|$|Allium ursinum - {{known as}} ramsons, <b>buckrams,</b> wild garlic, {{broad-leaved}} garlic, wood garlic, bear leek, or bear's garlic - is a wild relative of chives native to Europe and Asia. The Latin name {{is due to}} the brown bear's taste for the bulbs and its habit of digging up the ground to get at them; they are also a favourite of wild boar. In Europe, where ramsons are popularly harvested from the wild, similarity to poisonous plants such as lily of the valley or Colchicum autumnale regularly leads to cases of poisoning.|$|R
2500|$|... on a {{life and}} death so full of heart-going realities as poor Chatterton's, to find such shadowy nobodies as cherub-winged Death, Trees of Hope, bare-bosomed Affection and simpering Peace, makes one's blood {{circulate}} like ipecacuanha. But it is so. A young man by strong feelings is impelled to write on a particular subject, {{and this is all}} his feelings do for him. They set him upon the business and then they leave him. he has such a high idea of what poetry ought to be, that he cannot conceive that such things as natural emotions may be allowed to find a place in it; his learning therefore, his fancy, or rather conceit, and all his powers of <b>buckram</b> are put on the stretch.|$|E
2500|$|When {{creating}} new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound {{in many different}} materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are leather, decorative paper, and cloth (see also: <b>buckram).</b> Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of particularly high-quality materials (especially full leather bindings), are known as fine or extra bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book {{that has already been}} printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. [...] "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, decorative end sheets, leather cover etc." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1785, {{thanks to}} her {{association}} with Mary Granville Delany, a woman known in both literary and royal circles, Frances travelled {{to the court of}} King George III and Queen Charlotte, where the Queen offered her the post of [...] "Keeper of the Robes", with a salary of £200 per annum. Frances hesitated in taking the office, not wishing to be separated from her family, and especially resistant to any employment that would restrict the free use of her time in writing. However, unmarried at 34, she felt constrained to accept and thought that improved social status and income might allow her greater freedom to write. Having accepted the post in 1786, she developed a warm relationship with the queen and princesses that lasted into her later years, yet her anxieties proved to be accurate: the position exhausted her and left her little writing time. Her unhappiness was intensified by a poor relationship with her colleague Elizabeth Schwellenburg, co-Keeper of the Robes, who has been described as [...] "a peevish old person of uncertain temper and impaired health, swaddled in the <b>buckram</b> of backstairs etiquette." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was as {{a student}} that I first knew Fleeming, as one of that modest number of young men who sat under his ministrations in a soul-chilling class-room {{at the top of}} the University buildings. [...] His {{presence}} was against him as a professor: no one, least of all students, would have been moved to respect him at first sight: [...] rather short in stature, markedly plain, boyishly young in manner, cocking his head like a terrier with every mark of the most engaging vivacity and readiness to be pleased, full of words, full of paradox, a stranger could scarcely fail to look at him twice, a man thrown with him in a train could scarcely fail to be engaged by him in talk, but a student would never regard him as academical. [...] Yet he had that fibre in him that order always existed in his class-room. I do not remember that he ever addressed me in language; at the least sign of unrest, his eye would fall on me and I was quelled. Such a feat is comparatively easy in a small class; but I have misbehaved in smaller classes and under eyes more Olympian than Fleeming Jenkin's. He was simply a man from whose reproof one shrank; in manner the least <b>buckrammed</b> of mankind, he had, in serious moments, an extreme dignity of goodness. So it was that he obtained a power over the most insubordinate of students, but a power of which I was myself unconscious. I was inclined to regard any professor as a joke, and Fleeming as a particularly good joke, perhaps the broadest in the vast pleasantry of my curriculum. [...] I was not able to follow his lectures; I somehow dared not misconduct myself, as was my customary solace; and I refrained from attending. This brought me at the end of the session into a relation with my contemned professor that completely opened my eyes. During the year, bad student as I was, he had shown a certain leaning to my society; I had been to his house, he had asked me to take a humble part in his theatricals; I was a master in the art of extracting a certificate even at the cannon's mouth; and I was under no apprehension. But when I approached Fleeming, I found myself in another world; he would have naught of me. 'It is quite useless for YOU to come to me, Mr. Stevenson. There may be doubtful cases, there is no doubt about yours. You have simply NOT attended my class.' The document was necessary to me for family considerations; and presently I stooped to such pleadings and rose to such adjurations, as made my ears burn to remember. He was quite unmoved; he had no pity for me. - 'You are no fool,' said he, 'and you chose your course.' I showed him that he had misconceived his duty, that certificates were things of form, attendance a matter of taste. Two things, he replied, had been required for graduation, a certain competency proved in the final trials and a certain period of genuine training proved by certificate; if he did as I desired, not less than if he gave me hints for an examination, he was aiding me to steal a degree. 'You see, Mr. Stevenson, these are the laws and I am here to apply them,' said he. I could not say but that this view was tenable, though it was new to me; I changed my attack: it was only for my father's eye that I required his signature, it need never go to the Senatus, I had already certificates enough to justify my year's attendance. 'Bring them to me; I cannot take your word for that,' said he. 'Then I will consider.' The next day I came charged with my certificates, a humble assortment. And when he had satisfied himself, 'Remember,' said he, 'that I can promise nothing, but I will try to find a form of words.' He did find one, and I am still ashamed when I think of his shame in giving me that paper. He made no reproach in speech, but his manner was the more eloquent; it told me plainly what a dirty business we were on; and I went from his presence, with my certificate indeed in my possession, but with no answerable sense of triumph. That was the bitter beginning of my love for Fleeming; I never thought lightly of him afterwards.|$|R
