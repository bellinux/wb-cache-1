Yangwu was equipped with a classroom for the training of Chinese midshipmen and officers. At the time of {{a report in the}} Shanghai Courier in June 1876, there were 30 such sailors under tuition. She had been recently commanded by the Captain Tracey, an Englishman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recalled to the Royal Navy and promoted to Post-captain. He was replaced with his fellow countryman, Captain Luxmore. There were two further English members of the crew, both officers, while the rest were Chinese.|$|E
5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s Massino was a Bonanno associate. He led a {{successful}} truck hijacking crew, {{with the assistance}} of his brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale and carjacker Duane Leisenheimer, while fencing the stolen goods and running numbers using the lunch wagon as a front. He also befriended another mob hijacker, future Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. Increasingly prosperous, Massino opened his own catering company, J Catering, which became another front for his activities. Massino's mentor Rastelli was expected to become Bonanno boss upon the 1973 death of Natale Evola, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> convicted the previous year of loansharking and then in 1976 of extortion, leaving him imprisoned. In his absence Carmine Galante, a former consigliere and convicted drug trafficker, seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the French army had {{completely}} evacuated Russian territory by December 1812 but their defeat sparked anti-French sentiments in Germany and Prussia joined the Russians, forming a Sixth Coalition. Hostilities thus continued in early 1813 but Nansouty's wound did not yet allow {{him to return to}} action, so he was offered the prestigious position of Colonel-General of dragoons (16 January), in replacement of General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, who had just died of exhaustion. Nansouty's wound was very serious <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> very lucky: the bullet that pierced his knee only tore through flesh, leaving his kneecap intact. Having missed {{the first part of the}} campaign, General Nansouty was recalled to a field command once his knee wound was cured, towards mid-1813. He accepted to take the helm of the Guard cavalry, with a complement of 5,000 sabres, and including Guyot's Grenadiers-à-cheval, Letort's Dragons, Lefebvre-Desnouettes Chasseurs-à-cheval and Édouard Colbert's Chevau-légers lanciers.|$|E

25|$|The {{chief of}} police is the highest-ranking officer of the Toronto Police Service. The {{position}} was known as High Constable until 1859 and then as Chief Constable until the 1957 when the Toronto Police Department was amalgamated with 12 other Toronto-area forces to form the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force. Most chiefs have been chosen amongst the ranks of Toronto force and promoted/appointed {{from the ranks of}} deputy chief; Fantino was hired away from the York Regional Police, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a career officer with Metro Toronto Police leaving as Acting Staff Superintendent.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} analyser, {{a mechanical}} analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms {{to perform the}} integration. In 1876 James Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.|$|E
25|$|Calitri also {{suggests}} controversy about Lt. Grummond. On dispatching Grummond and the cavalry to join Fetterman, Carrington explicitly ordered Grummond {{to stay with}} Fetterman during the operation. Yet, at some point, Grummond led his cavalry far in advance of Fetterman, chasing the Indian decoys in direct violation of his orders. Grummond had a distinguished Civil War record as a combat officer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> court martialed for drunkenness and abuse of civilians. He {{was known as a}} bigamist. Calitri suggests that he was reckless and possibly disobeyed orders during the December 6 fight.|$|E

25|$|Denied a {{military}} career in France, Eugene decided to seek service abroad. One of Eugene's brothers, Louis Julius, had entered Imperial service the previous year, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> immediately killed fighting the Ottoman Turks in 1683. When {{news of his}} death reached Paris, Eugene decided to travel to Austria {{in the hope of}} taking over his brother's command. It was not an unnatural decision: his cousin, Louis of Baden, was already a leading general in the Imperial army, as was a more distant cousin, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. On the night of July 26, 1683, Eugene left Paris and headed east.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 Galán {{was elected}} as councilman for the capital, Bogotá {{to be named}} the {{following}} year, in 1981 as possible candidate for the presidency of Colombia amid divisions in the Liberal Party that intended to challenge the majorities of the party led by Alfonso López Michelsen and then president Julio César Turbay, but voters leaned for the conservative candidate Belisario Betancur. For Galán {{it had been a}} positive outcome despite losing, his party Nuevo Liberalismo had gained a 10% of the total votes winning 21 of the 23 Department Assemblies and getting reelected as Senator <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> criticised by the Liberal Party for creating divisions among them and indeed losing the Presidency.|$|E
25|$|Robot {{was written}} by Terrance Dicks, who had joined the series in 1968 as {{assistant}} script editor and took over the script editor position soon after. Dicks stated that a major influence for this story was King Kong. The initial script was written before Tom Baker had been cast as the Fourth Doctor, {{and there was some}} discussion of returning to an older actor. This would have required a younger character to handle the action scenes, so the character of Harry Sullivan was created. This was Sullivan's debut story, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> mentioned in the final episode of the preceding serial, when the Brigadier telephoned him, requesting medical help for the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|In January 1988 he won {{his first}} top {{division}} tournament championship, which was also the first for the Tatsunami-Isegahama icihimon or group of stables in nearly twenty years. In 1989 he won 40 out of a possible 45 bouts in the first three championships of the year and came very close to promotion to the highest rank of yokozuna, but he was defeated by yokozuna Hokutoumi in playoffs in both January and May 1989. His 13–2 mark in May was his fifth consecutive runner-up performance, and his seventh overall, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to win two tournaments in a row, regarded by the Japan Sumo Association as the minimum requirement for yokozuna promotion after the embarrassment of Futahaguro's brief tenure at sumo top's rank.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 2009, on {{day three}} of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand, he {{displayed}} an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid. Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight {{into the hands of}} a waiting Brendon McCullum. A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a little slow and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so.|$|E
25|$|Although {{letting the}} Countess escape was morally questionable, {{it was not}} uncommon. In The Nemean Lion, Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, {{allowing}} her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare {{the feelings of the}} murderer's relatives. In The Augean Stables, he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder. The victim had been responsible for a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of no fewer than five people. There was no question of his guilt, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death.|$|E

25|$|Lok was {{secretly}} reporting {{the results of}} the assays to Sir Francis Walsingham, who had Sir Edward Dyer analyse a sample of the ore. Dyer found no gold, confirming Walsingham in his view that Agnello's results were 'but an alchemist matter'. Agnello and Lok were not discouraged; Agnello advised Lok that he had a 'friend in the court' who would move the Queen to grant them a licence to mine the ore, and on 19 March 1557 Lok and Agnello entered into an agreement for bringing back to England more ore like the original black stone. However, by then the secret had leaked out, largely through Agnello's own indiscretion. Sir William Winter asked to meet with Lok on 29 March, and revealed that he had learned of Agnello's assays of the ore from Sir William Morgan, who had had the news from Sir John Berkeley, who had had it from Agnello himself. Moreover, not only had Agnello communicated his findings to Berkeley, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> assisted in some of his tests by Christopher Schutz, a German metallurgist working in London who had been introduced to Agnello by Berkeley and Morgan. According to Winter, the matter was of too great importance for himself and Lok, and fit only for 'the Prince'. In a lengthy letter dated 22 April 1577 Lok outlined all these matters to the Queen, and enclosed therewith six 'writings' to him from Agnello, as well as a copy of the contract signed by himself and Agnello.|$|E
