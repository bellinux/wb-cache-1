5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

25|$|United States v. Booker, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} concerning criminal sentencing. The Court {{ruled that}} the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial requires that, other than a prior conviction, only facts admitted by a defendant or proved <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt to a jury {{may be used to}} calculate a sentence exceeding the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, whether the defendant has pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. The maximum sentence a judge may impose is a sentence based upon the facts admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Tipping {{formulated}} {{what he saw}} as {{the correct}} test of disorderly behaviour as; Conduct in a qualifying location is disorderly if, as a matter of time, place and circumstance, it causes anxiety or disturbance at a level which is <b>beyond</b> what <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> citizen should be expected to bear. Unless that is so, the conduct will not warrant the intervention of the criminal law. If it is so, the public has a legitimate interest in proscribing the behaviour, and thereby protecting citizens from it. In this way public order is protected.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, {{the firm}} {{launched}} its first money market fund, the Reserve Fund, to provide effective cash management, a dollar back {{for every dollar}} invested and <b>beyond</b> that <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> rate of return. The fund was launched with no sales force or advertisements, and instead relied on phoning investment advisers and handing out brochures. In January 1973, the New York Times published an article about their firm {{and by the end}} of the year it had $100 million in deposits. Brown left the company in 1985, but maintained stock in half the business. In 1999, Bent bought out Brown's stake in the company and continued to run it with his sons.|$|R
50|$|Wear {{and tear}} {{is a form}} of {{depreciation}} which is assumed to occur even when an item is used competently and with care and proper maintenance. For example, repeated impacts may cause stress to a hammer's head. This stress is impossible to prevent in the normal use of the tool for its designed task, and any attempt to avert it impedes its functionality. At the same time, it is expected that the normal use of a hammer will not break it <b>beyond</b> repair during <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> life cycle.|$|R
25|$|Burden of production: P has to {{show some}} {{evidence}} that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then {{it is up to}} the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt. If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).|$|E
25|$|Once {{the jury}} found that {{one or more of}} the {{aggravating}} factors existed <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt, then the defendant would be eligible for the death penalty. The jury may, but was not required to, then evaluate all the evidence it had heard, including mitigating evidence and other aggravating evidence not supporting one of the ten factors <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt—and decide whether the defendant should live or die. This scheme is called a non-weighing scheme, because the sentencer is not required to weigh the statutory aggravating factors against mitigating evidence before imposing a death sentence.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Emil Giese testified {{regarding}} the fingerprints which were matched.

5000|$|The {{prosecution}} bears onus {{of showing}} admissibility, {{but only on}} a balance of probabilities. This {{is in contrast to}} the normal onus to show admissibility <b>beyond</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>a</b> doubt. The statute, in other words, has lowered the onus. This onus is of doubtful constitutionality. In S v Kotzè, {{the facts of the case}} did not make it necessary to consider this issue, but the court said obiter that the onus ought to be beyond reasonable doubt, and also stressed need for compliance with section 252A(6). The accused must be given an indication of basis of challenge. See also S v Naidoo, where the court held that the onus is beyond reasonable doubt.Note that there is a duty on the accused to set out the grounds of objection.The method of determining admissibility is, generally, by way of a trial within a trial.Some cases dealing with section 252A include* S v Hammond;* S v Mkhonto; ...|$|R

Both algorithms are randomized (Las Vegas). • Given a source s, we present an algorithm that maintains (1 + ɛ) -approximate shortest paths from s with an expected total update time of Õ(n 2 +O(1 / √ log n)) over all deletions (so the amortized time is about Õ(n 2 /m)).

Using Monte Carlo {{methods to}} {{simulate}} the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons, we model the spectrum of the Galactic black hole candidate Cyg X- 1, which shows evidence of a nonthermal tail extending <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> few hundred keV.
