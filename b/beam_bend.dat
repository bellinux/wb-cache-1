These two physical characteristics may be employed as a quality indicator of the concrete cover within the procedures of the assessment of the structural durability. The three-point bending test configuration was utilised to drive the crack propagation process through several loading–unloading cycles, between which, the electrical resistivity and ultrasonic measurements over the fractured region were performed. Equivalent elastic crack model was used for estimation of the fracture progression (described via the effective crack length increment) at those loading stages. The relationships between changes of the non-destructively determined parameters, the effective crack length and the distance from crack tip are discussed with respect to two variants of treatment of the test specimens’ surface: the pre-dried surface and the wet surface. A difference between the ultrasonic and electrical resistivity measurements ability with respect to crack width is found in the case of wet samples. Web of Science 8013...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{types of}} peeling {{experiments}} are {{performed in the}} present research. One is for the Al film/Al 2 O 3 substrate system with an adhesive layer between the film and the substrate. The other one is for the Cu film/Al 2 O 3 substrate system without adhesive layer between the film and the substrate, and the Cu films are electroplated onto the Al 2 O 3 substrates. For the case with adhesive layer, two kinds of adhesives are selected, which are all the mixtures of epoxy and polyimide with mass ratios 1 : 1. 5 and 1 : 1, respectively. The relationships between energy release rate, the film thickness and the adhesive layer thickness are measured during the steady-state peeling process. The effects of the adhesive layer on the energy release rate are analyzed. Using the experimental results, several analytical criteria for the steady-state peeling based on the bending model and on the two-dimensional finite element analysis model are critically assessed. Through assessment of analytical models, {{we find that the}} cohesive zone criterion based on the <b>beam</b> <b>bend</b> model is suitable for a weak interface strength case and it describes a macroscale fracture process zone case, while the two-dimensional finite element model is effective to both the strong interface and weak interface, and it describes a small-scale fracture process zone case...|$|E

This rolling weight deflectometer (RWD) optically measures the maximum amplitude of the depression basin using {{a new type of}} laser sensor that operates on the principle of triangulation.
