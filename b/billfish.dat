5|$|Marine {{halfbeaks}} are omnivores {{feeding on}} algae; marine {{plants such as}} seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals {{during the day and}} plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as <b>billfish,</b> mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, <b>billfish,</b> jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include <b>billfish,</b> tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E

25|$|Oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} can be true residents, partial residents, or {{accidental}} residents. True residents live their entire {{life in the}} open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as tuna, <b>billfish,</b> flying fish, sauries, pilotfish and remoras, dolphin, ocean sharks and ocean sunfish. Most of these species migrate {{back and forth across}} open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} forage fish, driven by {{nutrient}} availability and their life-cycle stage, form vast schools at predictable locations {{and times of}} the year. Normally, schooling works well as protection from occasional predators. Fish schooling in vast numbers may attract correspondingly huge numbers of predators, including seabirds, sharks, tuna, <b>billfish,</b> pods of dolphins, and killer and humpback whales. Aggregations of predators on such a scale means the schools can be attacked on all sides and panicked into forming bait balls.|$|E

25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait.

The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including <b>billfish,</b> cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a minor}} {{recreational}} fishery for rainbow runner {{in parts of the}} world. Often they are taken while trolling for other species such as tuna and mackerel, but are often targeted inshore by anglers on the west coast of the Americas using surface 'popper' style lures. The fish are caught {{on a wide variety of}} lures and baits, with deep diving lures, surface lures and even saltwater flies used to good measure. The species takes a wide variety of baits including live and cut fish, squid, octopus, and probably other crustaceans resembling their natural food. They are renowned as gamefish, especially at larger sizes. The species themselves are also commonly used as bait, either as live bait or dead bait rigged to be trolled behind game boats for larger species such as <b>billfish</b> and tuna.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family Lamnidae – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the <b>billfish,</b> which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E

Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either longlining or purse seining.
