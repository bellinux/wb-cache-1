40|$|International audienceThe {{origin and}} {{distribution}} of microbial contamination in Oualidia lagoon were assessed using faecal coliform and streptococci bacteria. The lagoon is used for recreation, oyster farming and fishing. Samples were collected from 9 different sites and physicochemical and microbiological analyses which were performed monthly during 2 years (October 2003 -October 2005). These samples were subjected to <b>bacteriological</b> <b>analysis</b> faecal coliform count and faecal streptococcal count. The physicochemical analysis of the water samples includes pH, temperature and specific conductance. The bacterial genera were identified {{on the basis of}} their morphological and physiological characteristics. The present study confirmed the presence of bacterial indicators of faecal origin at various stations in every stretch of Oualidia lagoon system. The samples collected from different sites of the lagoon showed wide variations in the counts of bacteria. The Bacterial population varied with seasonal variations in the water body. The Faecal coliform counts are increased during the summer months and lowered during the winter ones. The opposite happens of streptococci bacteria that are increased during the winter months and lowered during the summer ones depending on rainfall. Positive correlation was established between faecal coliform and streptococci bacteria. The results of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>analysis</b> of water revealed that the situation is alarming. The <b>Bacteriological</b> <b>analysis</b> of lagoon water indicated that water was polluted by faecal contaminants to the extent that it was unsuitable from the recreation point of view and hence needed thorough impoundment...|$|R

Two plants of commercial beef slaughterhouse located in Goiânia and fiscalized by the Federal Inspection Service were used to develop the research. The spray-chilling treatment was accomplished in an intermittent way, commanded by a controlled logical program, with cycles of 90 seconds, in intervals of 30 minutes, during the first 4 hours of the chilling process.

40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} polymicrobial {{bacterial}} infection on chronic wounds {{has been studied}} extensively, but standard <b>bacteriological</b> <b>analysis</b> is not always sensitive enough. Molecular approaches represent a promising alternative to the standard <b>bacteriological</b> <b>analysis.</b> This work aimed to assess the usefulness of a panbacterial quantitative real-time PCR reaction to quantitate the total bacterial load in chronic wounds treated with Cutimed™ Sorbact™, a novel therapeutic approach based on hydro-phobic binding of bacteria to a membrane. The results obtained by panbacterial real-time PCR on conserved sequences of the bacterial 16 S gene show that the bacterial burden significantly decreased in 10 out of 15 healing chronic wounds, and did not change in 5 out of 5 non-healing chronic wounds. On the contrary, classical culture for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, and real-time PCR for Bacteroides and Fusobacterium did not show any correla-tion with the clinical outcome. Our study also shows that quantification of chronic wounds by panbacterial real-time PCR is to be performed on biopsies and not on swabs. These results show that panbacterial real-time PCR is a promising and quick method of determining the total bacterial load in chronic wounds, and suggest {{that it might be}} an important biomarker for the prognosis of chronic wounds under treatment...|$|R

Recorded history of contaminated drinking water supply has witnessed various viral, bacterial and protozoan diseases, globally. It is estimated that > 250 million cases of waterborne diseases are reported worldwide and over 25 million deaths are blamed due to waterborne-diseases. Pakistan has been facing the same problem due to improper water management, obsolete distribution infrastructure, bad sanitary condition and poor drinking water quality. An estimated 70 % Pakistani population living in rural areas have no access to potable water distribution system, whereas in urban areas, between 40 - 60 % urban population has access to safe and clean drinking water. In Pakistan, water filtration before distribution is almost non-existence and furthermore, WHO standards or NEQs are not followed for physiochemical and <b>bacteriological</b> <b>analysis</b> of drinking water. This study was conducted for physiochemical and <b>bacteriological</b> <b>analysis</b> of drinking water of new urban areas of Peshawar and compared the old historical areas of the city. Ten areas for drinking water samples were selected and samples were collected from water supply, distribution system and storage tanks. Physio-chemical (pH, turbidity and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and microbial analyses (Total and fecal coli form and E. coli were conducted (APHA, 2005).
