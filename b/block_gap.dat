40|$|Intercellular {{electrical}} communication between smooth muscle and endothelial cells was examined in guinea-pig mesenteric arterioles using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. The time {{course of the}} current required to impose a 10 mV voltage clamp step {{was used to determine}} the extent of electrical coupling between them. Currents recorded from both smooth muscle and endothelial cells relaxed in a multi-exponential manner, indicating the existence of electrical coupling between cells. 18 β-Glycyrrhetinic acid, a gap junction blocker, quickly blocked {{electrical communication}} at 40 μM, while neither heptanol nor octanol did so at concentrations of up to 1 mM. In the current clamp mode, repetitive spikes, induced by 10 mM Ba 2 + solutions, could be recorded from both kinds of cells. After <b>blocking</b> <b>gap</b> junctions, spikes could only be recorded from the smooth muscle cell layer, indicating that they had been conducted through myoendothelial junctions. In endothelial cells, acetylcholine (ACh, 3 μM) induced hyperpolarizing responses, which had two phases (an initial fast and a second slower phase) in the current clamp condition. This ACh response persisted in the presence of 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid, although this compound seemed to make the membrane slightly leaky. After <b>blocking</b> <b>gap</b> junctions, the membrane potential of a single cell in a multicellular preparation could be well clamped. Thus, 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid may be useful in studying the function of both arteriolar smooth muscle and endothelial cells while they remain located within a multicellular preparation...|$|R

Of these two, oleamide constitutes the most effective, and its structural requirements for inhibition of the gap junction are well defined. It requires a chain length of 16 – 24 carbons of which 16 – 18 carbons appears optimal, a polarized terminal carbonyl group capable of accepting but not necessarily donating a hydrogen bond, a Δ 9 cis double bond, and a hydrophobic methyl terminus.

These alterations are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, matrix proteins, and proinflammatory molecules. Inflammation decreases gap junctional communication and increases hemichannel activity leading to increased membrane permeability and altering tissue homeostasis. Since current treatments for diabetic nephropathy do not prevent renal damage, we postulated an alternative treatment with boldine, an alkaloid obtained from boldo with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic effects. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic and control rats were treated or not treated with boldine (50 [*]mg/Kg/day) for ten weeks. In addition, mesangial cells were cultured under control conditions or in high glucose concentration plus proinflammatory cytokines, with or without boldine (100 [*]µmol/L). Boldine treatment in diabetic animals prevented the increase in glycemia, blood pressure, renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio. Boldine also reduced alterations in matrix proteins and markers of renal damage. In mesangial cells, boldine prevented the increase in oxidative stress, the decrease in gap junctional communication, {{and the increase in}} cell permeability due to connexin hemichannel activity induced by high glucose and proinflammatory cytokines but did not <b>block</b> <b>gap</b> junction channels.

40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) pain is {{a common}} {{clinical}} problem, for which effective therapy is quite limited. Sensations from the GI tract, including pain, are mediated largely by neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and to a smaller extent by vagal afferents emerging from neurons in the nodose/jugular ganglia. Neurons in rodent DRG become hyperexcitable in models of GI pain (e. g., gastric or colonic inflammation), and {{can serve as a}} source for chronic pain. Glial cells are another element in the pain signaling pathways, and there is evidence that spinal glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) undergo activation (gliosis) in various pain models and contribute to pain. Recently it was found that satellite glial cells (SGCS), the main type of glial cells in sensory ganglia, might also contribute to chronic pain in rodent models. Most of that work focused on somatic pain, but in several studies GI pain was also investigated, and these are discussed in the present review. We have shown that colonic inflammation induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in mice leads to the activation of SGCs in DRG and increases gap junction-mediated coupling among these cells. This coupling appears to contribute to the hyperexcitability of DRG neurons that innervate the colon. <b>Blocking</b> <b>gap</b> junctions in vitro reduced neuronal hyperexcitability induced by inflammation, suggesting that glial gap junctions participate in SGC-neuron interactions. Moreover, <b>blocking</b> <b>gap</b> junctions by carbenoxolone and other agents reduces pain behavior. Similar changes in SGCs were also found in the mouse nodose ganglia, which provide sensory innervation to most of the GI tract. Following systemic inflammation, SGCs in these ganglia were activated, and displayed augmented coupling and greater sensitivity to the pain mediator ATP. The contribution of these changes to visceral pain remains to be determined. These results indicate that although visceral pain is unique, it shares basic mechanisms with somatic pain, suggesting that therapeutic approaches to both pain types may be similar. Future research in this field should include additional types of GI injury and also other types of visceral pain...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the antimalarial drug quinine specifically reduces currents through gap junctions formed by some connexins (Cx) in transfected mammalian cells, but does not affect other gap junction types. Quinine blocked Cx 36 and Cx 50 junctional currents in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner with half maximal blocking concentrations of 32 and 73 μM, respectively; Hill coefficients for block by quinine were about 2 for both connexins. In contrast, quinine did not substantially <b>block</b> <b>gap</b> junction channels formed by Cx 26, Cx 32, Cx 40, and Cx 43, and only moderately affected Cx 45 junctions. To determine {{the location of the}} binding site of quinine (pKa = 8. 7), we investigated the effect of quinine at various external and internal pH values and the effect of a permanently charged quaternary derivative of quinine. Our results indicate that the binding site for quinine is intracellular, possibly within the pore. Single-channel studies indicated that exposure to quinine induced slow transitions between open and fully closed states that decreased open probability of the channel. Quinine thus offers a potentially useful method to block certain types of gap junction channels, including those between neurons that are formed by Cx 36. Moreover, quinine derivatives that are excluded from other types of membrane channels may provide molecules with connexin-specific as well as connexin-selective blocking activity...|$|E

This study investigates the prejunctional and postjunctional effects of these compounds in guinea pig and mouse vas deferens using intracellular electrophysiological recording and confocal Ca 2 + imaging of sympathetic nerve terminals. In mice, heptanol (2  mM) reversibly decreased the amplitude of purinergic excitatory junction potentials (EJPs; 52 ± 5 %, P< 0. 05) while having little effect on spontaneous excitatory junction potentials (sEJPs). Heptanol (2  mM) reversibly abolished the nerve terminal Ca 2 + transient in 52 % of terminals. 18 βGA (10  μM) decreased the mean EJP amplitude, and increased input resistance in both mouse (137 ± 17 %, P< 0. 05) and guinea pig (354 ± 50 %, P< 0. 001) vas deferens indicating gap junction blockade. Further, 18 βGA increased the sEJP frequency significantly in guinea pigs (by 71 ± 25 %, P< 0. 05) and in 5 out of 6 tissues in mice (19 ± 3 %, P< 0. 05). Moreover, 18 βGA depolarised cells from both mice (11 ± 1 %, P< 0. 01) and guinea pigs (8 ± 1 %, P< 0. 005). Therefore, we conclude that heptanol (2  mM) decreases neurotransmitter release (given the decrease in EJP amplitude) by abolishing the nerve terminal action potential in a proportion of nerve terminals. 18 βGA (10  μM) effectively blocks the gap junctions, but the increase in sEJP frequency suggests an additional prejunctional effect, which might involve the induction of spontaneous nerve terminal action potentials...|$|E

Herein, the potentiation of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor response is disclosed, and a study of the structural features of oleamide required for potentiation of the 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 A response to serotonin (5 -HT) is described. Of the naturally occurring fatty acids, the primary amide of oleic acid (oleamide) is the most effective at potentiating the 5 -HT 2 A receptor response. The structural features required for activity were found to be highly selective. The presence, position, and stereochemistry of the Δ 9 -cis double bond is required, and even subtle structural variations reduce or eliminate activity. Secondary or tertiary amides may replace the primary amide but follow a well defined relationship requiring small amide substituents, suggesting that the carboxamide serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor but not donor. Alternative modifications at the carboxamide as well as modifications of the methyl terminus or the hydrocarbon region spanning the carboxamide and double bond typically eliminate activity. A less extensive study of the 5 -HT 1 A potentiation revealed that it is more tolerant and accommodates a wider range of structural modifications. An interesting set of analogs was identified that inhibit rather than potentiate the 5 -HT 2 A, but not the 5 -HT 1 A, receptor response, further suggesting that such analogs may permit the selective modulation of serotonin receptor subtypes and even have opposing effects on the different subtypes...|$|E
