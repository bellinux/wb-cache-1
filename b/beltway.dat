5|$|The next {{portion of}} I-97 {{predecessor}} highway was built as the four-lane Glen Burnie Bypass from Robert Crain Highway and New Cut Road {{north to the}} Baltimore <b>Beltway.</b> Construction on the four-lane freeway began in August 1954 with construction of several bridges over or for the highway; these bridges were completed in 1955 and 1956. The dual roadways and interchange ramps from {{the southern end of}} the bypass to MD 648 were constructed starting in March 1955; the concrete-surfaced highway was completed in February 1957. The northernmost portion of the bypass, including the adjacent portion of the Baltimore <b>Beltway,</b> was constructed between December 1955 and September 1957. US 301 was moved onto the bypass and the adjacent portion of the <b>Beltway</b> when the projects were completed in 1957. The small portion of I-97 north of the <b>Beltway</b> was added to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel project as a direct connection between the Glen Burnie Bypass and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway's southern approach from MD 2 in 1955. This segment was completed and opened with the tunnel and its approach highways in November 1957. The Glen Burnie Bypass was constructed with five interchanges: a partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 3 Business and New Cut Road; a tighter four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 174; a diamond interchange at MD 176; the current four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 648; and a half-cloverleaf interchange at I-695 allowing full access between the Glen Burnie Bypass and <b>Beltway</b> but no access between the <b>Beltway</b> and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway.|$|E
5|$|At {{the northeastern}} terminus, the Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> was planned to extend {{southeast}} along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south {{to cross the}} river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> was diverted to two freeways not planned {{to be part of}} it. The first was the Windlass Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore <b>Beltway.</b> Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Beyond I-83, I-695 turns {{northeast}} as a six lane {{road and}} heads into Towson, interchanging with MD 139 (Charles Street). The Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> heads through {{residential and commercial}} areas before coming to interchanges with MD 45 (York Road) near The Shops at Kenilworth and MD 146 (Dulaney Valley Road). Continuing east, the Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> passes {{to the north of}} Goucher College and comes to an interchange with Providence Road. I-695 turns southeast through residential areas past Providence Road and comes to an interchange with MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard) and Cromwell Bridge Road. The road continues towards Parkville, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with MD 41 (Perring Parkway) within commercial areas. The Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> continues through residential areas into Carney, coming to another cloverleaf interchange with MD 147 (Harford Road). Continuing east into White Marsh, the route encounters the western terminus of MD 43 (White Marsh Boulevard), a limited-access at-grade boulevard that provides access to White Marsh Mall, US 1 and I-95.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s {{plans were}} laid {{for a massive}} freeway system in Washington. Harland Bartholomew, who chaired the National Capital Planning Commission, thought that a rail transit system would never be {{self-sufficient}} because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline. But the plan met fierce opposition, and was altered to include a Capital <b>Beltway</b> system plus rail line radials. The <b>Beltway</b> received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.|$|E

5|$|The {{first part}} of the Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> to be {{completed}} was in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 finished in 1962. At this time, the original length of the Baltimore <b>Beltway,</b> from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first <b>beltway</b> in the United States built under the Interstate Highway System. A segment of the road completed in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, heading toward the Outer Harbor Crossing.|$|E

5|$|The Arundel Expressway was {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1956 as a freeway connecting Baltimore and Annapolis to relieve congestion on MD 2. By 1966, the highway was planned to begin at MD 173 at the city limits of Baltimore, intersect a planned cross-Patapsco section of the Baltimore <b>Beltway,</b> follow its current path to Pasadena, then continue paralleling MD 2 south to near U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301. The portion of the Arundel Expressway inside the <b>Beltway</b> was removed from plans in 1967, with the <b>Beltway</b> instead serving to connect the expressway with highways into Baltimore. The portion of the freeway south of Pasadena was planned to have intermediate interchanges at MD 648 in Severna Park and Jones Station Road (now College Parkway) in Arnold, and a toll plaza {{just south of the}} MD 100 interchange. The portion of the Arundel Expressway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. Instead of a BaltimoreAnnapolis freeway following the MD 2 corridor, in June 1979 the Maryland State Highway Administration announced it was constructing the freeway along the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors.|$|E

5|$|From here, I-695 heads {{northeast}} as {{an eight}} lane road and enters Pikesville, where it intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at a single-point urban interchange. A short distance later, the road {{comes to a}} partial interchange with MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue), with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. I-695 heads east to another partial interchange with Stevenson Road, which has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. The Baltimore <b>Beltway</b> passes through heavily forested land as it encounters Greenspring Avenue. Past this interchange, I-695 continues northeast through woodland before coming to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The interchange includes connections to MD 25 (Falls Road), which heads into the open countryside north of Baltimore. Within this interchange, I-83 forms a concurrency with I-695 and the roadway widens to ten lanes, with six for the <b>Beltway</b> and four for I-83. After running concurrently, I-83 splits from I-695 by heading north on the Harrisburg Expressway at a directional interchange.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{took place}} during the 1990s. The Charter/International Terminal, later renamed Terminal 2, was opened in December 1991 to handle rising international traffic to Las Vegas. An additional, nine-story parking garage and an underground tunnel linking the Las Vegas <b>Beltway</b> to the airport were constructed as well. In June 1998, the southwest and southeast wings of the D Gates were opened.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>beltways</b> in the United States {{do not use}} inner-outer {{directions}}, since compass directions are {{the predominant}} way to designate direction on numbered routes. <b>Beltways</b> with a single number for the entire route, such as Interstate 285 in the Atlanta area, are generally given compass directions that change as one travels along the route (what would be the inner loop is instead posted as north, then east, then south, then west, and vice versa for the outer loop).|$|R
