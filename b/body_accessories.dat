5000|$|In 1957, Yenko {{set up a}} {{performance}} shop for Chevrolet vehicles. The customers could either order high performance parts or have their car modified by Yenko's mechanics. The first popular aftermarket car made by Yenko came in 1965, {{in the form of}} a modified version of the Chevrolet Corvair. Named [...] "The Stinger", these Corvairs were modified with a variety of different <b>body</b> <b>accessories,</b> engine upgrades that produced outputs of up to 240 hp, as well as upgrades in steering, transmissions, suspension, and positraction differentials. A total of 185 Stingers are believed to have been built between 1965 and 1967. In 1967, when Chevrolet began selling the Camaro, Yenko began to modify SS Camaros by replacing the original L-78 396 in³ (6.5 L) engine with a Chevrolet Corvette's L-72 427 in³ (7.0 L) and upgrade the rear axle and suspensions. He also modified other Chevrolet vehicles like Chevelle and Nova by fitting them with L-72 engines. This limited series of cars sometimes began to take the name [...] "sYc" [...] (standing for Yenko Super Car), after the graphics found on the hoods and seat rests.|$|E
40|$|The sperm {{structure}} of the jumping bristletail Machilontus sp has been described. The species shares several sperm characteristics with other genera of the same order Archaeognatha. During late spermiogenesis the spermatid bends at half of its length with the two limbs closely apposed within the same plasma membrane. The sperm has a helicoidal bi-layered acrosome with a filamentous perforatorium and a long nucleus. The elongated flagellum consists of an axoneme with 9 accessory microtubules external to the 9 + 2, two rows of conventional mitochondria and two <b>accessory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The <b>accessory</b> <b>bodies</b> are located lateral to the axoneme and are probably responsible for the shifting of the accessory tubules in two opposite groups of 5 and 4 tubules, respectively. These sperm characteristics represent common traits of all Archaeognatha. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A research study has been made between the two main areas which is jewellery and electronic devices. Jewellery {{is an expression of}} the human need to adorn the body and look beautiful. Many jewellery design are available in market for example the necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earring. At the same time {{there are a variety of}} electronic devices which could easily attract the consumers especially students and people who is working. An electronic device is a device widely used in helping humans to communicate and do a work. Basically, jewellery adorns the body, and has very limited in term of functionality, through the ages the function of jewelry is more for fashion and <b>body</b> <b>accessories.</b> However, researcher looking to change the way of people thinking about the jewellery we wear. In this study, researcher will discuss the advantages by using jewellery which has a combination with electronic technology devices. As a jewellery maker and designer, researcher will demonstrate a different approach to the development of electronic jewellery. Finally, by using the high technology approach as a part on jewellery, it can give the jewellery a new identity that not only limited for accessories but also features advance technology. It is important for jewellery industries to have something new development for the future in order to make sure that the jewellery industry can compete with other accessories...|$|E

40|$|Radon 222 Rn {{release from}} bedrock {{contributes}} substantially {{to the internal}} irradiation of the human body. The negative health impact of unregulated long-term exposure to radon has been proved in epidemiological studies. Because radon is generated by the radioactive decay from uranium-bearing rocks and soils, geological knowledge can contribute to defining the areas with enhanced radon exhalation from rocks and soils. In large plutonic rock <b>bodies</b> <b>accessory</b> minerals such as zircon or zirconium minerals in phonolites {{are considered to be}} some of the most intensive sources of radon. A uniform method for soil gas radon measurements applied in the Czech Republic as well as soil gas data processing have enabled us to construct maps of radon risk from bedrock in various scales. Different approaches to the constructing of the maps are discussed in the paper. The prediction of radon risk maps is illustrated using comparisons of indoor radon measurements and bedrock radon data. Detailed radon risk maps primarily serve for locating the indoor radon detectors, which, consequently, leads to advancing the detection of existing dwellings, which have exceeded indoor radon guidance level and their mitigation...|$|R

40|$|Basal body {{replication}} during estrogen-driven ciliogenesis in the {{rhesus monkey}} (Macaca mulatta) oviduct {{has been studied}} by stereomicroscopy, rotation photography, and serial section analysis. Two pathways for basal body production are described: acentriolar basal body formation (major pathway) where procentrioles are generated from a spherical aggregate of fibers; and centriolar basal body formation, where procentrioles are generated by the diplosomal centrioles. In both pathways, {{the first step in}} procentriole formation is the arrangement of a fibrous granule precursor into an annulus. A cartwheel structure, present within the lumen of the annulus, is composed of a central cylinder with a core, spoke components, and anchor filaments. Tubule formation consists of an initiation and a growth phase. The A tubule of each triplet set first forms within the wall material of the annulus in juxtaposition to a spoke of the cartwheel. After all nine A tubules are initiated, B and C tubules begin to form. The initiation of all three tubules occurs sequentially around the procentriole. Simultaneous with tubule initiation is a nonsequential growth of each tubule. The tubules lengthen and the procentriole is complete when it is about 200 mµ long. The procentriole increases in length and diameter during its maturation into a basal body. The addition of a basal foot, nine alar sheets, and a rootlet completes the maturation process. Fibrous granules are also closely associated with the formation of these basal <b>body</b> <b>accessory</b> structures...|$|R

40|$|Sperm {{ultrastructure}} {{is examined}} and described for the actinocyclidid nudibranchs Actinocyclus verrucosus, Hallaxa iju and Hallaxa indecora. Although general characteristics {{were consistent with}} previously described heterobranch observations, present investigations revealed ultrastructural synapomorphies for the family based on the morphology of the terminal region of the spermatozoon. In actinocyclidids, the axonemal microtubules penetrate for some distance beyond the annulus, and the annular <b>accessory</b> <b>body</b> elongates to completely seal the terminal region. Chromodoris also has an annular <b>accessory</b> <b>body</b> that completely seals the axoneme and terminal region, {{but it does not}} extend far beyond the annulus, and it is possible that these states were derived independently. Cytochemical staining confirmed that there was no glycogen present in the posterior region of the sperm for H. indecora or Chromodoris kuniei. However, representatives of other chromodoridid genera (Noumea, Risbecia) have an axoneme that penetrates through the entire annular complex, after which it is sheathed by a glycogen deposit. Similarities in the acrosomal complex support the proposed sister group relationship between the Actinocyclidae and Chromodorididae...|$|R
30|$|These {{findings}} {{illustrate the}} promise that multiple lineups hold for assessing the accuracy of individual eyewitnesses. However, {{the results of these}} studies are curtailed by the poor identification accuracy for some person aspects.

In comparison, identification accuracy was much higher for frontal views of faces, at 72 % (Pryke et al., 2004) and 61 % (Sauerland & Sporer, 2008), and combinations of other person aspects with such frontal face portraits were most useful for diagnosing eyewitness accuracy.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{roots of}} Anacyclus {{pyrethrum}} DC. (Compositae) {{are employed in}} Ayurvedic system of medicine as “Vajikaran Rasayana” — a category of drugs for vitality and virility. They {{are believed to have}} aphrodisiac action. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate their effects on sexual behavior in male rats. Methods: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into control group, testosterone group, low-dose (50 mg/kg) petroleum ether extract (PEE) group and high-dose (100 mg/kg) PEE group. PEE obtained from the roots of Anacyclus pyrethrum was administered orally to albino rats once daily, and 0. 5 mg/kg (body weight) of testosterone was given intramuscularly twice weekly and served as positive control. The course of treatment was 28 days. The effects of PEE and testosterone on changes in <b>body</b> and <b>accessory</b> sexual organ weights, sexual behavior, penile erection and sexual performance were studied before treatment, after 15 and 28 days of treatment and 7 and 15 days after treatment. Results: After 28 days of treatment, PEE and testosterone had a marked influence on <b>body</b> and <b>accessory</b> sexual organ weights as compared with arachis oil. The treated male rats were more receptive and oriented towards female rats and increased precopulatory activities like licking and sniffing of female anogenitals were observed. The penile erection index was significantly increased with reduction in mount latency and intromission latency period. There were four-fold increase in mount and three-fold increase in intromission frequency in treated rats reflecting improved sexual performance. The behavioral and sexual parameters were also observed after a lapse of 7 and 15 days of discontinuance of drug treatment. Conclusion: Unlike testosterone, the PEE of Anacyclus pyrethrum shows efficacy in rats tested after the lapse of 7 and 15 days of discontinuation of treatment. This suggests that the drug has prolonged effect and capacitate the treated rats for improved sexual potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{flagellum}} of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera, Apidae) {{consists of}} two mitochondrial derivatives, an axoneme and two <b>accessory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The mitochondrial derivatives are of unequal size and lie parallel to the axoneme. In the larger derivative four regions can be distinguished while in the smaller, only three. The region occurring only in the larger derivative consists of paracystalline material. The smaller mitochondrial derivative terminates anterior to the larger one. An extremely long centriolar adjunct is observed between the nucleus and the smaller mitochondrial derivative. This adjunct is compact, very electron dense and gradually tapers from base toward apex, finishing at the anterior extremity of the axonemal microtubules. In this flagellar region, {{there is only one}} <b>accessory</b> <b>body</b> present between the larger mitochondrial derivative and the axoneme. Anteriorly, the tips of the axonemal microtubules are inserted in a well developed mass of granular appearance. This material surrounds the nuclear base, separating it from the anterior end of the larger mitochondrial derivative. We believe that the structure identified here as a centriolar adjunct is homologous to that observed in Formicidae, Ichneumonoidea and Symphyta. Therefore, very probably, it is common to most Hymenoptera...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{report the}} {{diagnosis}} and treatment of one case of solitary plasmacytoma of spine with amyloidosis and investigate the clinicopathological features combined with literatures. Methods and Results The patient was a 46 -year-old woman. She suffered from weakness of both lower limbs, unsteady gait and numbness of toes for 20 d. MRI examination revealed an irregular mass behind the spinal cord at T 5 - 7 level and T 6 - 7 vertebral <b>body</b> <b>accessory.</b> The enhanced MRI showed obvious heterogeneous enhancement. The border was clear and spinal dura mater was compressed to shift forward. During operation, T 5 - 7 processus spinosus and vertebral laminae were eroded, and the cortex of bone showed "moth-eaten" erosion. The intraspinal and extradural lesion had rich blood supply, loose bone structure and intact spinal dura mater. Histologically, tumor cells were composed of intensive small cells, and focal plasmacytoid cells were seen. Flake pink staining substance was among them. Artificial cracks were common and multinuclear giant tumor cells were scatteredly distributed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the cytoplasm of tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD 138, CD 38 and vimentin (Vim),scatteredly positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and negative for immune globulin κ light chain(IgGκ) and λ light chain (IgGλ), CD 99, S- 100 protein (S- 100), pan cytokeratin (PCK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), HMB 45 and CD 34. The Ki- 67 labeling index was 1. 25 %. Congo red staining showed the pink staining substance was brownish red. Hybridization in situ examination showed the DNA content of IgGκ was more than that of IgGλ. The final pathological diagnosis was solitary plasmacytoma of spine with amyloidosis. The patient was treated with postoperative chemotherapy, and there was no recurrence or metastasis during 18 -month follow-up period. Conclusions Solitary plasmacytoma of spine with amyloidosis is a rare tumor. The imaging features can offer a few diagnostic cues. However, a clear diagnosis depends on specific histomorphology, immunophenotyping, special staining and hybridization in situ examination.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 01. 010 </p...|$|R

Here, we present the first quantitative and comparative analysis of locust transcripts, in particular pacifastin-related precursor (SGPP- 1 - 3) mRNAs, between isolated-reared (solitary) and crowd-reared (gregarious) desert locusts, revealing a phase-dependent transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes. While the SGPP- 1 and SGPP- 3 transcripts were most abundant in fat body from crowd-reared males, corresponding to significantly higher levels than in isolated-reared males, the SGPP- 2 transcript was detected most abundantly in brain from crowd-reared male locusts.
