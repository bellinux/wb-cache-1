2500|$|On April 24, 2013, the Port Authority's Board of Commissioners {{awarded a}} $743.3 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Skanska Koch and Kiewit Infrastructure Company. The bridge's clearance would be raised approximately , from [...] to , {{with the construction of}} a new roadway above the existing roadway within the current arch structure. The construction involved building support columns first, then adding prefabricated road segments using a gantry crane that rolled on top of the arch. The gantry crane would construct one rope-supported section of the new roadway at a time, using a temporary beam to support the existing roadway while each rope was replaced. The existing roadway would then be removed. Temporary <b>bridge</b> <b>closures</b> allowed new floor beams to be attached to the arch's ropes in order to support steel stringers that would hold up the new roadway. This work was expedited by Barack Obama's presidential administration due to the importance of the project to national commerce, being one of the first applicants to Obama's [...] "We Can't Wait" [...] initiative of important infrastructure projects. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also considered the project a high priority for his state.|$|E

40|$|We {{described}} and validated a quantitative anatomical labeling protocol for extracting clinically relevant quantitative parameters for ventral hernias (VH) from routine computed tomography (CT) scans. This information was {{then used to}} predict the need for mesh <b>bridge</b> <b>closure</b> during ventral hernia repair (VHR). A detailed anatomical labeling protocol was proposed to enable quantitative description of VH including shape, location, and surrounding environment (61 scans). Intra- and inter-rater reproducibilities were calculated for labeling on 18 and 10 clinically acquired CT scans, respectively. Preliminary clinical validation was performed by correlating 20 quantitative parameters derived from anatomical labeling with the requirement for mesh <b>bridge</b> <b>closure</b> at surgery (26 scans). Prediction of this clinical endpoint was compared with similar models fit on metrics from the semi-quantitative European Hernia Society Classification for Ventral Hernia (EHSCVH). High labeling reproducibilities were achieved for abdominal walls (± 2 mm in mean surface distance), key anatomical landmarks (± 5 mm in point distance), and hernia volumes (0. 8 in Cohen's kappa). 9 out of 20 individual quantitative parameters of hernia properties were significantly different between patients who required mesh <b>bridge</b> <b>closure</b> versus those in whom fascial closure was achieved {{at the time of}} VHR (p< 0. 05). Regression models constructed by two to five metrics presented a prediction with 84. 6 % accuracy for bridge requirement with cross-validation; similar models constructed by EHSCVH variables yielded 76. 9 % accuracy. Reproducibility was acceptable for this first formal presentation of a quantitative image labeling protocol for VH on abdominal CT. Labeling-derived metrics presented better prediction of the need for mesh <b>bridge</b> <b>closure</b> than the EHSCVH metrics. This effort is intended as the foundation for future outcomes studies attempting to optimize choice of surgical technique across different anatomical types of VH...|$|R

50|$|Decades of {{deferred}} maintenance caused {{the bridge to}} deteriorate significantly; by 1988, more than 200 cables in the suspension had snapped, and pieces of concrete were falling from the bridge. The bridge's structural integrity was rated as 1.6 out of a scale of 1 to 7. Inspectors were appointed to monitor the bridge's status and make temporary <b>bridge</b> <b>closures</b> based {{on the amount of}} stress placed on the bridge. The bridge was completely shut down to motor vehicle traffic and subway trains on April 11, 1988, after a painter noticed a large hole in a girder; upon further review, inspectors also discovered severe corrosion in a floor beam. The bridge was reopened in June 1988.|$|E
50|$|On September 9, 2011, Kentucky and Indiana {{officials}} announced {{the closure of}} the Sherman Minton Bridge.

50|$|A {{number of}} courses have {{included}} starts and finishes at Griffiths Stadium {{on the campus}} of the University of Saskatchewan, as well as portions of the course along roadways on the campus. The event in 2006 featured a start and finish at the east end of the Bowl, by the historic College Building. The various routes have been determined by a number of factors, including: road and <b>bridge</b> <b>closures</b> and construction, City and University approval and support, as well as the factors involved in choosing the location of the start/finish line. Extensive lobbying has occurred to develop a route which can remain unchanged from year to year, but that has proved impossible to do. The start/finish area is now at Diefenbaker Park and incorporates a river crossing on the South Circle Drive Bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The Vesey Street {{bridge was}} {{designed}} with ADA accessibility in mind, and escalators were installed to allow pedestrians access the bridge without using stairs.

In the {{earliest}} of the closures the R11s were signed up as 3, the line's old West End number. The Manhattan Bridge's closure from April 26, 1986 to November 12, 1988, had the T's old service pattern almost exactly recreated, with service running to Astoria during rush hours, and during evenings and weekends to 57th Street. Since it also ran during weekday middays, it was sent to Queensboro Plaza. The TT's route was replicated once the M was rerouted from the Brighton Line to the West End Line running to Bay Parkway. With {{the closing of the}} Manhattan Bridge's north side on July 22, 2001, the B in Brooklyn was replaced by the [...] via Broadway express in essence operating the old T route until 2004.

40|$|This study evaluates traffic {{reactions}} to two alternative construction plans of Lafayette Bridge crossing the Mississippi River in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota. We calibrate a travel demand model previously developed and evaluate network performance in dif- ferent construction {{phases of the}} two alternative scenarios. Most significant changes in traffic condition occur during the <b>bridge</b> <b>closure</b> phase of scenario 2. The measur- able impacts of <b>bridge</b> <b>closure</b> on traffic conditions are limited within the region of I- 494 and US 61 {{to the east and}} I- 35 E to the west. The increases in freeway traffic are moderate. Most travelers choose to use the arterial bridges as alternative routes. The Robert Street Bridge and the Wabasha Street Bridge will see significant traffic increases. Overall changes in consumer surplus indicate that scenario 2 has a some- what higher user cost ($ 5, 209 /day). However, the magnitude of difference in consumer surplus is very small and well within “margin of error”. The ultimate decision needs to consider construction cost savings due to faster construction, and safety issues in addition to changes in user cost. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
