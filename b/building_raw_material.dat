40|$|By {{this time}} in the Russian Federation there is {{collected}} a huge file of data describing the influence of all natural sources of ionizing radiation on population in municipal conditions. These data are collected and generalized in radiation hygiene passports of the Russian Federation for the last 16 years and in the reporting forms of federal statistical supervision No 4 -DOZ “Data on doses of population irradiation due to the natural and manchanged radiation background” for a period of 14 years. These data are received by direct measurements of gamma radiation dose rate in the premises and in the open air on the territory of settlements. Measurements were made with the most different dosimeters; their technical and metrological parameters differ considerably. In this regard of certain interest is evaluation of this data reliability degree; that will help to find out the reasons of higher levels of the Russian Federation population external irradiation in comparison with average global dose values. In this article an attempt was made to evaluate reliability degree of data on the population external irradiation doses using the radiation hygiene passports of territories and reporting forms No 4 -DOZ for the whole period of supervision. For this there was used the known dependence between the gamma radiation dose rate and natural radionuclides effective specific activity (AEFF) in inhabitancy objects. For this purpose there were used the data on average AEFF values of <b>building</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and of local manufacture materials, which are presented in radiation hygiene passports of territories. Definition of design value of gamma radiation dose rate in the buildings and in the open air according to AEFF measurement data in <b>building</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and in local manufacture materials actually enables to get an independent evaluation of the population external irradiation doses. Comparison of two evaluations of the population external irradiation levels enabled to reveal certain territories on which the population external irradiation doses are obviously overestimated or underestimated. It is proved that the specified population external irradiation dose values for certain entities and for the whole country are much closer to corresponding evaluations by foreign experts and to the average global levels. </p...|$|R

In view of the medicinal importance of Acacia nilotica and the therapeutic utility of flavonoids, an attempt has been made to isolate novel flavonoids from the wood of cultivated A. nilotica. The extraction of crude ethanol extract from the A. nilotica wood was followed by fractionation with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol in increasing order of polarity of the solvent. The mixed ethyl acetate and methanol extract afforded three pure compounds through column chromtomatography and fractional crystallization. Among the isolated phenolic compounds, a new acylated flavonoidic glycoside, tricin- 4 ′-O-β-(6 ′′-hydroxycinnamic) -glucoside (1) was isolated from the wood of A. nilotica together with two known compounds, gallic acid and apigenin.

On the basis of field and theoretical studies we received empirical dependences and characteristic curves of the amounts of: construction waste, total emissions into the atmosphere, the cost of capital repairs (reconstruction) with calculated construction volumes and technical condition of constructions. These graphic and empirical regularities prove the connection {{of the amount of}} construction waste and total emissions to the atmosphere with the technical condition of the building during reconstructions. Results. The developed method of reducing environmental pollution during reconstruction of buildings in urban areas includes 5 stages starting from information gathering ending with reusing construction waste. Preliminary forecasting and assessment of major repairs (reconstruction) is possible while making calculations by derived formulas. For planning of measures to reduce pollution we have developed a scheme for treatment of construction wastes and offered alternatives for their use. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract: According to the {{literature}} approximately 40 % of global energy in 2007 has been using in the buildings {{which is responsible for}} 30 % of total carbon emission. This human- induced carbon emissions cause climate change by increasing global temperature. In this sense, energy consumption in the life cycle of buildings results in two different components: embodied carbon and operational carbon. Embodied carbon, encompasses extraction and processing of raw materials; manufacturing, transportation and distribution; use, reuse, maintenance, recycling and disposal. Operational energy is consumed in operating the buildings, e. g. heating and cooling systems, lighting, and home appliances which accomplish some household functions. A number of measures and targets have been introduced, including various fiscal and regulatory instruments to handle climate change and move towards low and zero carbon buildings. Overall, the increase in efficiency of energy use is as vital as production of energy and results in direct or indirect energy savings, and subsequently mitigates high energy cost. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the impact of ???different strategies??? on embodied energy and ultimately on the environment. This concern provides a more integrative approach to calculate a building???s embodied carbon in the housing life cycle assessment considering the following strategies: 1.
