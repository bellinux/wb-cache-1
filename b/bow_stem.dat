40|$|Storable Tubular Extendible Members (STEMs) {{are often}} used for {{deploying}} spacecraft subsystems such as flexible solar cell blankets, like those used on Hubble Telescope. Systems using long flexible appendages such as the STEMs used on Hubble often undergo thermal excitations due to a thermal gradient through the cross-section when entering and exiting solar eclipse. These vibrations can greatly reduce pointing accuracy and lead to mission failure. Boeing obtained a patent in 2006 for the High Power Thin Film Solar Array (HPSA) which could provide 130 kW of power to a spacecraft. The deployed structure relies on <b>bowed</b> <b>STEMs</b> and a tether system to keep the solar panels taut and in alignment with the sun. The system is predicted to minimize the effects of thermal excitation. This thesis proves that the HPSA design can outperform its straight STEM counterparts with respect to thermal-structural stability under unidirectional solar radiant heating {{through the use of}} finite element models created in ANSYS. In comparison to Hubble, a HPSA wing configuration is capable of providing a 44. 5 percent increase in the first modal frequency, a 98. 8 percent reduction in steady state tip deflection, and 96. 9 percent reduction in tip vibration amplitude...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. 39 sets of {{preoperative}} hip x-rays {{were studied}} {{to find out}} whether Chinese patients need revision femoral components with a different shape and size from western patients. Methods. From July 1998 to June 2001, the pre-revision x-rays of 39 revision total hip replacements among 38 Chinese patients (21 men and 17 women) were studied. The component size that produced the best distal canal-filling in the anteroposterior x-ray was determined by using templates of 200 -mm femoral components used commonly for Caucasian patients. Results. The diameter of the component needed was 13. 5 mm or less in 54 % of cases, compared with only 17 % for Caucasian patients as reported in the literature (p< 0. 01). When lateral templates of the corresponding size were put over the lateral x-rays, the anterior cortex of the 200 -mm straight stem was shown to have thinned by 2. 0 mm or more in 36 % of hips; for 200 -mm <b>bowed</b> <b>stem,</b> there was thinning of the anterior cortex by 2. 0 mm or more in only 5 % of hips (p< 0. 01). Conclusion. Chinese patients are likely to need smaller femoral components than Caucasian patients, and may benefit from bowed-stem components in femoral revision. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

6000|$|Three ships still hung on {{the next}} margin of destruction, {{steaming}} desperately to their moorings, dashed helplessly together. The Calliope was the nearest in; she had the Vandalia close on her port side and a little ahead, the Olga close a-starboard, the reef under her heel; and steaming and veering on her cables, the unhappy ship fenced with her three dangers. About a quarter to nine she carried away the Vandalia's quarter gallery with her jib-boom; a moment later, the Olga had near rammed her from the other side. By nine the Vandalia dropped down on her too fast to be avoided, and clapped her stern under the bowsprit of the English ship, the fastenings of which were burst asunder as she rose. To avoid cutting her down, {{it was necessary for}} the Calliope to stop and even to reverse her engines; and her rudder was at the moment--or it seemed so to the eyes of those on board--within ten feet of the reef. [...] "Between the Vandalia and the reef" [...] (writes Kane, in his excellent report) [...] "it was destruction." [...] To repeat Fritze's manoeuvre with the Adler was impossible; the Calliope was too heavy. The one possibility of escape was to go out. If the engines should stand, if they should have power to drive the ship against wind and sea, if she should answer the helm, if the wheel, rudder, and gear should hold out, and if they were favoured with a clear blink of weather in which to see and avoid the outer reef--there, and there only, were safety. Upon this catalogue of [...] "ifs" [...] Kane staked his all. He signalled to the engineer for every pound of steam--and at that moment (I am told) much of the machinery was already red-hot. The ship was sheered well to starboard of the Vandalia, the last remaining cable slipped. For a time--and there was no onlooker so cold-blooded as to offer a guess at its duration--the Calliope lay stationary; then gradually drew ahead. The highest speed claimed for her that day is of one sea-mile an hour. The question of times and seasons, throughout all this roaring business, is obscured by a dozen contradictions; I have but chosen {{what appeared to be the}} most consistent; but if I am to pay any attention to the time named by Admiral Kimberley, the Calliope, in this first stage of her escape, must have taken more than two hours to cover less than four cables.

5000|$|September 1916From: Lieutenant Leefe Robinson, Sutton's Farm.To: The Officer Commanding No. 39 H. D. Squadron.Sir:I {{have the}} honour {{to make the}} {{following}} report on night patrol made by me {{on the night of}} the 2-3 instant. I went up at about 11.08 p.m. {{on the night of the}} second with instructions to patrol between Sutton's Farm and Joyce Green.I climbed to 10,000 feet in fifty-three minutes. I counted what I thought were ten sets of flares - there were a few clouds below me, but on the whole it was a beautifully clear night. I saw nothing until 1.10 a.m., when two searchlights picked up a Zeppelin S.E. of Woolwich. The clouds had collected in this quarter and the searchlights had some difficulty in keeping on the airship.By this time I had managed to climb to 12,000 feet and I made in the direction of the Zeppelin - which was being fired on by a few anti-aircraft guns - hoping to cut it off on its way eastward. I very slowly gained on it for about ten minutes.I judged it to be about 800 feet below me and I sacrificed some speed in order to keep the height. It went behind some clouds, avoiding the searchlight, and I lost sight of it. After fifteen minutes of fruitless search I returned to my patrol.I managed to pick up and distinguish my flares again. At about 1.50 a.m. I noticed a red glow in the N.E. of London. Taking it to be an outbreak of fire, I went in that direction. At 2.05 a Zeppelin was picked up by the searchlights over N.N.E. London (as far as I could judge).Remembering my last failure, I sacrificed height (I was at about 12,900 feet) for speed and nosed down in the direction of the Zeppelin. I saw shells bursting and night tracers flying around it.When I drew closer I noticed that the anti-aircraft aim was too high or too low; also a good many shells burst about 800 feet behind-a few tracers went right over. I could hear the bursts when about 3,000 feet from the Zeppelin.I flew about 800 feet below it from <b>bow</b> to <b>stem</b> and distributed one drum among it (alternate New Brock and Pomeroy). It seemed to have no effect;I therefore moved to one side and gave them another drum along the side - also without effect. I then got behind it and by this time I was very close - 500 feet or less below, and concentrated one drum on one part (underneath rear). I was then at a height of 11,500 feet when attacking the Zeppelin.I had hardly finished the drum before I saw the part fired at, glow. In a few seconds the whole rear part was blazing. When the third drum was fired, there were no searchlights on the Zeppelin, and no anti-aircraft was firing.I quickly got out of the way of the falling, blazing Zeppelin and, being very excited, fired off a few red Very lights and dropped a parachute flare.Having little oil or petrol left, I returned to Sutton's Farm, landing at 2.45 a.m. On landing, I found the Zeppelin gunners had shot away the machine-gun wire guard, the rear part of my centre section, and had pierced the main spar several times.I have the honour to be, sir,Your obedient servant, (Signed) W.

Both phenomena excite the governing vertical 2 -node mode and possibly higher order modes, and consequently increase the fatigue and extreme loading of the hull girder. These effects are currently disregarded in conventional ship design. The thesis focuses on the additional fatigue damage on large blunt ships. The study was initiated by conducting an extensive literature study and by organizing an international workshop. The literature indicated that wave induced vibrations should be expected on any ship type, but full scale documentation (and model tests) was mainly related to blunt ships. While the theoretical investigation of whipping mostly focused on slender vessels with pronounced bow flare, full scale measurements indicated that whipping could be just as important for blunt as for slender ships. Moreover, all estimates dealing with the fatigue damage due to wave induced vibration based on full scale measurements before the year of 2000 were nonconservative due to crude simplifications. The literature on the actual importance of the additional fatigue contribution is therefore scarce. The workshop was devoted to the wave induced vibrations measured onboard a 300 m iron ore carrier. Full scale measurements in ballast condition were compared with numerical predictions from four state-of-the-art hydroelastic programs. The predicted response was unreliable, and the programs in general underestimated the vibration level. The excitation source was either inaccurately described or lacking. The prediction of sea state parameters and high frequency tail behavior of the wave spectra based on wave radars without proper setting and calibration was also questioned. The measurements showed that vibrations in ballast condition were larger than in the cargo condition, the vibration was more correlated with wind speed than wave height, head seas caused higher vibration levels than following seas, the vibration level towards beam seas decayed only slightly, and the damping ratio was apparently linear and about 0. 5 %. The additional vibration damage constituted 44 % of the total measured fatigue loading in deck amidships in the North Atlantic iron ore trade, with prevailing head seas encountered in ballast condition. Four hypotheses, which may contribute to explain the high vibration levels, were formulated. They include the effect of the steady wave field and the interaction with the unsteady wave field, amplification of short incident waves due to bow reflection, bow impacts including the exit phase and sum frequency excitation due to the bow reflection. The first three features were included in a simplified program {{to get an idea of}} the relative importance. The estimates indicated that the stem flare whipping was insignificant in ballast condition, but contributed in cargo condition. The whipping was found to be sensitive to speed. Simplified theory was employed to predict the speed reduction, which was about 5 kn in 5 m significant wave height. The estimated speed reduction was in fair agreement with full scale measurements of the iron ore carrier. Extensive model tests of a large 4 -segmented model of an iron ore carrier were carried out. Two loading conditions with three bow shapes were considered in regular and irregular waves at different speeds. By increasing the forward trim, the increased stem flare whipping was again confirmed to be of less importance than the reduced bottom forces in ballast condition. The bow reflection, causing sum frequency excitation, was confirmed to be important both in ballast and cargo condition. It was less sensitive to speed than linear springing. The second order transfer function amplitude displayed a bichromatic sum frequency springing (at resonance), which was almost constant independent of the frequency difference. The nondimensional monochromatic sum frequency springing response was even higher. The sum frequency pressure was mainly confined to the bow area. Surprisingly, for the sharp triangular <b>bow</b> with vertical <b>stem</b> designed to remove the sum frequency effect, the effect was still pronounced, although smaller. The reflection of incident waves did still occur. In irregular head sea states in ballast condition whipping occurred often due to bottom bilge (flare) impacts, starting with the first vibration cycle in hogging. This was also observed in cargo condition, and evident in full scale. This confirmed that the exit phase, which was often inaccurately represented or lacking in numerical codes, was rather important. Flat bottom slamming was observed at realistic speeds, but the vibratory response was not significantly increased. Stern slamming did not give any significant vibration at realistic forward speeds. The fatigue assessment showed that the relative importance of the vibration damage was reduced for increasing peak period, and secondly that it increased for increasing wave heights due to nonlinearities. All three bows displayed a similar behavior. For the sharp bow, the additional fatigue damage was reduced significantly in steep and moderate to small sea states, but the long term vibration damage was less affected. The effect of the bulb appeared to be small. The contribution of the vibration damage was reduced significantly with speed. For a representative North Atlantic iron ore trade with head sea in ballast and following sea in cargo condition the vibration damage reduced from 51 % at full speed to 19 % at realistic speeds. This was less than measured in full scale, but the damping ratio of 1 - 3. 5 % in model tests was too high, and the wave damage in following seas in cargo condition was represented by head sea states (to high wave damage due to too high encounter frequency). Furthermore, the contribution from vibration damage was observed to increase in less harsh environment from 19 % in the North Atlantic to 26 % in similarWorld Wide trade. This may also be representative for the effect of routing. The dominating wave and vibration damage came from sea states with a significant wave height of 5 m. This was in agreement with full scale results. In ballast condition, the nonlinear sum frequency springing appeared to be more important than the linear springing, and the total springing seemed to be of equivalent importance as the whipping process, which was mainly caused by bottom bilge (flare) impacts. All three effects should be incorporated in numerical tools. In full scale, the vibration response reached an apparently constant level as a function of wave height in both ballast and cargo condition in head seas. This behaviour could be explained by the speed reduction in higher sea states. The vibration level in cargo condition was 60 - 70 % of the level in ballast condition. Although common knowledge implies that larger ships may experience higher springing levels due to a lower eigenfrequency, a slightly smaller ore carrier displayed a higher contribution from the vibration damage (57 %) in the same trade, explained by about 1 m smaller draft. Moreover, the strengthening of the larger ship resulted in a 10 % increase of the 2 -node eigenfrequency. The subsequent measurements confirmed that an increased hull girder stiffness was not an effective means to reduce the relative importance of the vibration damage. The relative importance of the excitation sources causing wave induced vibration may differ considerably for a slender compared to a blunt vessel. Therefore, full scale measurements on a 300 m container vessel were briefly evaluated. The damping ratio was almost twice as high as for several blunt ships, possibly due to significant contribution from the container stacks. The reduced relative importance of the vibration damage with increasing wave height for the iron ore carrier in full scale was opposite to the trend obtained for the container vessel. Less speed reduction in higher sea states was confirmed, and the whipping process was apparently relatively more important for the container vessel. Both for the blunt and slender ship of roughly 300 m length, the total fatigue damage due to vibration was of similar importance as the conventional wave frequency damage. The contribution to fatigue damage from wave induced vibrations should be accounted for, for ships operating in harsh environment with limited effect of routing, especially when they are optimized with respect to minium steel weight. The four hypotheses were all relevant in relation to wave induced vibrations on blunt ships. Further numerical investigation should focus on the sum frequency springing caused by bow reflection and the whipping impacts at the bow quarter. The wave amplification, steady wave elevation and the exit phase must be properly incorporated. When it comes to design by testing, an optimized model size must be selected (wall interaction versus short wave quality). The speed must be selected in combination with sea state. The wave quality must be monitored, and a realistic damping ratio should be confirmed prior to testing. For the purpose of investigating sum frequency excitation, a large restrained bow model tested in higher waves may be utilized to reduce uncertainties in the small measured pressures. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
