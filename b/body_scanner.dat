50|$|In CT, Technicare {{developed}} {{and sold the}} DeltaScan line of products. A prototype whole <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> was installed at the Cleveland Clinic. The <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> was installed there and was introduced first. This was followed with the head only dual slice Delta 25 which competed with the EMI Mark-I, the world's first CT scanner. This followed the <b>body</b> <b>scanner,</b> Delta 50 {{one of the first}} devices to scan the whole body. Both the Delta 25 and 50 scanned the patient in 1-2 minutes which was about twice as fast as EMI products. These first units were of the first (single detector) and second (multiple detector) generation translate and rotate systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{first full}} body {{security}} scanner {{was developed by}} Dr. Steven W Smith, who developed the Secure 1000 whole <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> in 1992. He subsequently sold the device and associated patents to Rapiscan Systems, who now manufacture and distribute the device.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Steve Smith, {{inventor}} of the <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> in 1991, and president of Tek84, {{one of the companies}} that produces the machines, has stated that the concerns of Dr. Brenner and UCSF Scientists regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners are incorrect. He states the values used for X-ray penetration were incorrectly based on the description of the imaging depth which describes what the instrument sees and is a few mm into the skin and the dosage depth which is deeper. He describes experimental proof that the X-rays have the same properties as any other X-Rays and the penetration is correct to be averaged over the whole body. Dr. Smith has provided measured data from an operating <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> to explain his position.|$|E
50|$|The Transportation Security Administration {{has taken}} several {{thousand}} images of individuals {{passing through the}} Full <b>Body</b> <b>Scanner</b> to demonstrate its effectiveness to TSA employees.

50|$|A Gallup poll given {{just after}} the 2009 Christmas Day bombing attempt {{suggested}} that 78% of American airline travelers approved of <b>body</b> <b>scanners</b> while 20% disapproved. 51% {{indicated that they would}} have some level of discomfort with full-body scans, while 48% said they would not be uncomfortable with the idea.

50|$|On July 9, 2012, Falcon said he {{was stopped}} by Transportation Security Administration {{officers}} in the San Francisco International Airport, due to the large bulge in his pants.

50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{technologies}} of full <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> used for body imaging; a competing technology is backscatter X-ray. Millimeter wave scanners themselves come in two varieties: active and passive. Active scanners direct millimeter wave energy at the subject and then interpret the reflected energy. Passive systems create images using only ambient radiation and radiation emitted from the human body or objects.|$|E
50|$|While airport {{security}} {{may be the}} most visible and public use of <b>body</b> <b>scanners,</b> companies have opted to deploy passive employee screening to help reduce inventory shrink from key distribution centers.|$|R

50|$|Twenty-first-century {{technologies}} are defining {{a new era}} of customized and mass-customized clothing. The 3D <b>body</b> <b>scanner</b> is a fast and reliable tool for collecting measurements. Once a scan is taken (a 12-second process), it is transferred to the computer and visualized on the screen (about 45 seconds). In the next step, the software automatically locates body landmarks and generates measurements (about one minute depending on the number of measurements desired).|$|E
5000|$|... "Don't {{touch my}} junk" [...] is {{a phrase that}} became popular in the United States in 2010 as a {{criticism}} of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) patdowns. The word [...] "junk" [...] is American English slang for a man's genitals. The phrase refers to the offense many people took to the November 2010 decision by TSA to begin full body patdowns of airline passengers in the U.S. who refused {{to go through a}} full <b>body</b> <b>scanner.</b>|$|E
50|$|LMDC {{has seen}} a 50% {{reduction}} {{in the amount of}} contraband being introduced into the jail complex after installing a <b>body</b> <b>scanner.</b> The scanner allows for officers to better detect contraband items being hidden on persons' bodies such as drugs, cell phones, and lighters. The scanner is located in the booking area and is used as individuals are first brought into the facility. The department has also installed a scanner for the Community Corrections Center on Chestnut Street.|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{security}} environment {{after the end}} of Cold War and 9 / 11 have strongly affected our security concepts and paradigms. In the field of counter-terrorism, a serious conceptual and practical debate on the relationship between security and human rights and freedoms has begun. The goal {{of this paper is to}} reflect on this complex relationship at the conceptual level and introduce the empirical debate on this relationship in the field of civil aviation (case of introducing <b>body</b> <b>scanners).</b> The paper’s results show that the concept of human security usefully integrates the care for human rights and security of individuals. The debate on the potential introduction of <b>body</b> <b>scanners</b> on the European airports was actually a debate on the ways of providing individual human security on the airports with simultaneous concern for other human rights. The output of this debate was a compromise: <b>body</b> <b>scanners</b> can be used at the discretion of individual airports and member states, but are not an obligatory measure on all European airports...|$|R
50|$|Since September 2011 {{the airport}} {{terminal}} {{has been under}} renovation, that includes reconstruction of the TSA checkpoint to support full <b>body</b> <b>scanners,</b> expansion of office space behind the ticket counters, and new facilities for automated baggage screening.|$|R
50|$|Two {{alternatives}} {{that have been}} argued for by experts, such as Prof Chris Mayhew from Birmingham University, are chemical-based scanners and bomb-sniffing dogs.
