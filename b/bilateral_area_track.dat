40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the manuscript written by Lee et al. (1), who described the imaging findings of pulmonary complications in two patients with influenza A (H 1 N 1) infection. The first patient showed ill-defined ground-glass opacity nodules and patchy areas of groundglass attenuation. The second, with secondary bacterial pneumonia, showed <b>bilateral</b> <b>areas</b> of lobar consolidation and ground-glass opacities. In addition, some other reports describing the imaging features, especially on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), {{have been published in}} the last months (2). The predominant HRCT findings reported bilateral, peripheral, ground-glass opacities and/or <b>bilateral</b> <b>areas</b> of consolidation. The patients who presented with consolidations had a more severe clinical course (2). Limited data are available, however, on the tomographic or pathological aspects observed during the recovery phase after H 1 N 1 infection. However, the information available on pneumonias caused by other strains of the Influenza A virus allow us to presume similarities with the behavior of H 1 N 1. In the early stages, features of diffuse alveolar damage are predominant. Later stages may show typical changes of organization and fibrosis, including interstitial fibrosis, and Corresponding author...|$|R

In hospitalized SARS patients, the abnormalities tend to progress to bilateral air-space consolidation.

40|$|Cognitive control {{enables us}} to guide our {{behaviour}} in an appropriate, context-dependent manner. This behavioral flexibility is probed by task-switching paradigms, which require working memory to maintain relevant rules and flexibility to switch between rules. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been implicated in rule maintenance by neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. While these studies have identified a correlation between DLPFC activity and rule maintenance, deactivation studies allow us to establish a causal relationship. Here we have examined the effect of <b>bilateral</b> deactivation of <b>areas</b> 46 and 9 / 46 d on rule maintenance, while a monkey (Macacca mulatta) performed blocks of pro- and anti-saccades. Areas 46 and 9 / 46 d were deactivated by pumping chilled methanol through bilaterally implanted cryoloops. Rule maintenance was tested while monkeys performed blocks of pro- and anti-saccades with and without instruction cues. Monkeys had to look toward the stimulus on pro-saccade trials {{and away from the}} stimulus to its mirror location on anti-saccade trials. After 15 - 25 correct responses, the task switched (e. g. from pro-saccades to anti-saccades) without any explicit signal to the monkey. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>area</b> 46 deactivation impaired performance throughout both blocks, while <b>bilateral</b> <b>area</b> 9 / 46 d deactivation did not affect performance. Surprisingly, bilateral deactivation of both areas (46 and 9 / 46 d) impaired performance on anti-saccade trials but recovered performance on pro-saccade trials. These results present a causal relationship between area 46 and rule maintenance and provide evidence for functional dissociation between subregions in the dorsolateral PFC for rule-guided behavior...|$|R

The GRAPES-3 experiment at present is operating with ~400 (each 1 m2) plastic scintillator detectors with a separation of 8 meters, to record the density and arrival time of particles in cosmic ray showers, and in continuous operation.
