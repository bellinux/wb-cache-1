40|$|This paper {{describes}} a low power {{implementation of a}} secure EPC UHF Passive RFID Tag <b>baseband</b> <b>system.</b> To ensure the secure information transaction of the tag, traditionally {{the focus is on}} directly applying a low-complexity encryption engine. However, this approach could lead to the problem of known-plaintext attack (KPA). The attacker could make use of the known header to reveal the secret key. Our contributions are proposing a novel datanow solution enforced by an AES cryptography engine embedded inside the passive RFID tag. Also, various low power design techniques are proposed to reduce the power consumption of the baseband of the passive tag. In particular., we propose a moving window PIE decoding algorithm and an improved Tausworthe sequence generator to reduce the power consumption. Other low power design techniques such as clock gating, optimal clock driving and parallel operations are extensively used {{in the design of the}} tag.

40|$|Coding, {{which refers}} to the {{translation}} between the user-provided information bits (source bits) and the transmitted data symbols (coded symbols), Error-control coding, whose aim is to mitigate the effects of noise, was discussed in Chapters 12 and 13. This chapter discusses the use of coding to control the statistics of the data symbols, thereby introducing a measure {{of control over the}} spectrum of the transmitted signal. For example, undesired correlations among information bits can be removed by scrambling, which is a reversible transformation of the bits in a way that affects the statistics. Alternatively, the spectrum can be controlled by introducing a controlled correlation among data symbols in the form of redundancy (the remaining sections). In Chapters 12 and 13 we saw applications of redundancy to the correction and prevention of channel errors. One way to control the spectrum is through the design of a line code (Sections 19. 2 and 19. 3). One major motivation in <b>baseband</b> <b>systems</b> is the problem of baseline wander introduced by the a. c. coupling inherent in transformers and broadband amplifiers.

These systems have now changed the environment of the receiver design resulting in the development of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with new signal processing algorithms. GNSS receiver receives the signals from a GNSS satellite constellation, digitally processes them and provides position, velocity and time. Hardware GNSS receivers have good efficiency, good computational load and low power consumption. Such a hardware GNSS receiver is presented here. GNSS Receiver Reference Design is a fully functional L 1 only GNSS receiver design. The main objective for this design is to make fully open access architecture (HW + SW) available to industry partners and researchers for development of GNSS and GNSSenhanced devices, for investigating current GNSS receivers and receiver algorithms and upcoming GNSS receiver standards. Baseband processing generates pre-processed data from received signals. It comprises digital signal processing executed by custom hardware (<b>baseband</b> <b>system)</b> and control processing implemented by a soft-core processor (COFFEE RISC core). The <b>baseband</b> <b>system</b> component performs acquisition and tracking of 6 channels. It currently provides only GPS coarse/acquisition (C/A) code. It is implemented by Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic, supported by hardware macros. The <b>baseband</b> <b>system</b> and the processor are to be integrated efficiently to manage the receiver activity. The integration is achieved by designing an interface that is compatible with the standard bus architecture. The interface is a shared system bus that contains a register database. The interface is implemented in RTL and verified in functional simulations. In this thesis, another objective of verifying the <b>baseband</b> <b>system</b> is achieved by targeting the maximum code coverage.
