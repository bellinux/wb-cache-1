The significant advances in cluster networks in recent years have made it practical to connect tens of thousands of hosts via networks that have enormous and scalable total capacity, and in which communications between a host and any other host incur the same cost. The same cost property frees users from consideration of network contention and allows them to concentrate on load-balancing issues. We formulate the server placement problem on a cluster that has the same cost property as a weighted bipartite matching with the goal of balancing the workload on the I/O nodes. To find an optimal solution to this problem, we propose an O(n 3 2 m(log n + logm)) algorithm, called Load <b>Balance</b> <b>Matching</b> (LBM), where n is the number of compute nodes andm is the number of I/O servers...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} model for {{analyzing}} English sentences including coordinate conjunctions such as "and", "or", "but" and the equivalent words. Syntactic analysis of the English coordinate sentences {{is one of the}} most difficult problems for machine translation (MT) systems. The problem is selecting, from all possible candidates, the correct syntactic structure formed by an individual coordinate conjunction, i. e. determining which constituents are coordinated by the conjunction. Typically, so many possible structures are produced that MT systems cannot select the correct one, even if the grammars allow to write the rules in the simple notations. This pa- per presents an English coordinate struc- ture analysis model, which provides tOl> down scope information of the correct syntactic structure by taking advantage of the symmetric patterns of the parallelism. The model is based on a <b>balance</b> <b>matching</b> operation for two lists of the feature sets, which provides four effects: the reduction of analysis cost, the improvement of word disambiguation, the interpretation of ellipses, and robust analysis. This model was practically implemented and incorporated into the English-Japanese MT system, and provided about 75 % accuracy in the practical translation use...|$|E

We hypothesized that Cr supplementation would improve muscle energy balance (as assessed by muscle inosine monophosphate (IMP) accumulation) during intense endurance exercise. Methods: Seven well-trained men completed two experimental trials involving approximately 1 h of intense endurance exercise (cycling 45 min at 78 ± 1 % V̇O 2 peak followed by completion of 251 ± 6 kJ as quickly as possible (performance ride)). Subjects ingested approximately 42 g·d - 1 dextrose for 5 d before the first experimental trial (CON), then approximately 21 g Cr monohydrate plus approximately 21 g·d - 1 dextrose for 5 d before the second experimental trial (CREAT). Trials were ordered because of the long washout time for Cr. Subjects were blinded to the order of the trials. Results: Creatine supplementation significantly (P < 0. 05) increased muscle total Cr (resting values: CREAT: 138. 1 ± 7. 9; CON: 117. 7 ± 6. 5 mmol·kg - 1 dm). No difference was seen between treatments in any measured muscle or blood metabolite after the first 45 min of exercise. Despite the performance ride completion time being similar in the two treatments (∼ 13. 5 min, ∼ 86 % V̇O 2 peak), IMP {{at the end of the}} performance ride was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower in CREAT than in CON (CREAT: 1. 2 ± 0. 6; CON: 2. 0 ± 0. 7 mmol·kg - 1 dm). <br /...|$|E
40|$|Misalignment in {{the lower}} limb {{prosthesis}} can cause great discomfort in the stump- socket interface and disturbance to gait function. In the long run, it could deteriorate the musculoskeletal system. In practice, the assessment still depends heavily on the verbal feedback of an amputee and experiences of a prosthetist. Moreover it is inconsistent amongst the prosthetists. Prosthetic alignment involves the adjustment of the prosthetic components relative to the gait quality. Some methods were proposed, including symmetry index, variation in a step-to-step transition, stability within the zone of integrated <b>balance,</b> <b>matching</b> roll-over shape eROS) to an ideal ROS and etc. It is not clear if the optimum alignment could be achieved. These methods exhibit a few limitations, i. e. limited use of gait variables in a single comparison and non-uniform results when different gait variables are applied. There {{is a need to}} provide an objective assessment method that processes high dimensional gait variables and presents them in a simple form. In addition, it could be impractical and expensive clinically to spend excessive time on a patient. An ambulatory gait measurement system could achieve this objective to a certain extent. This research investigates a potential engineering solution that is able to provide an assistive and objective assessment of the lower limb prosthetic alignment that provides optimal gait quality. The effort includes a development of a low-cost ambulatory gait measurement system which could be reliably used during indoor and outdoor trials. Human walking trials using the designed ambulatory system are designed and performed to justify the proposed solution. A novel gait analysis method using Principle Component Analysis and Self-Organizing Feature Map is proposed to process high dimensional gait data into a simple plot and a decision guide. The proposed methodology could help to collect sufficient gait data during indoor and outdoor gaits and could provide an objective gait assessment during the application of lower limb prosthetic alignments.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of immediate prior meditation (transcendental meditation) and relaxation upon the pattern of physiological response and performance of a fine motor and gross motor task. A second {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether the long term regular practice of a passive meditation technique (TM) produces a difference in the reaction to motor activity. A pretest-posttest control group randomized blocks design was used in this study. Sixteen transcendental meditators with three or more years regular practice were selected as the meditation group. Subjects with no history of relaxation training were recruited and 16 nonmeditators were selected to create matched pairs with subjects in the meditation group. Matching criteria were: sex, age, height, weight, current and customary activity level. Each matched pair of subjects was assigned to one of two groups with an attempt to <b>balance</b> <b>matching</b> criteria for each group. One group was randomly assigned to experimental procedures, the other group served as a control group. Subjects performed pre and posttests on a pursuit rotor task and a bicycle task while being monitored for heart rate, blood pressure and frontalis EMG. Experimental subjects meditated (meditation group) or relaxed with eyes closed (nonmeditation group) immediately prior to the posttest. Analysis of variance of trends was used to test the first hypothesis which dealt with the pattern of physiological response to the tasks. Analysis of variance was used to test the second hypothesis which dealt with the level of performance of each of the two tasks. A multiple regression analysis was used to test the third hypothesis which dealt with the relationship between performance and physiological response. Results showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups of meditators and nonmeditators in the pattern of physiological response, the level of performance, or the relationship of performance and physiological response to a fine motor or gross motor task...|$|E

40|$|Ultrashort laser pulses are a {{powerful}} tool for modifying the structure and properties of transparent materials. Depending on material properties and irradiation conditions, a wide variety of modifications can be induced such as surface and bulk periodic structures (nanogratings), densification with associated refractive index change, microvoids and void chains, phase transitions, etc. This gives rise to numerous technological applications based on 3 D photonic structures in bulk optical materials (waveguides, Bragg gratings, Fresnel zone plates, rewritable optical memories, and others). Among transparent materials, optical glasses are of prime importance for optoelectronics and photonics due to their relatively low cost, processability, and possibility of governing refractive index and inducing optical anisotropy. The physics behind laser-induced glass modifications is extremely rich and involves the multiplicity of the consecutive processes initiated by radiation absorption during the laser pulse and extending to millisecond time scales when the final structure becomes “frozen” in the glass matrix. While tremendous achievements have been made toward laser-writing techniques and assembling integrated optics, the physical mechanisms underlying glass modifications have not been fully understood. The exigency of controllable generation of desired structures requires deeper insight into of the mechanisms and spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-induced glass transformations. In this report, we will review the physical processes and mechanisms responsible for various forms of glass modification. Different approaches for modeling ultrashort laser pulse propagation in transparent materials will be critically assessed. The dynamics of laser-induced creation of free electron plasma inside bulk glass will be analyzed, depending on the irradiation conditions. A contradictory issue on the free electron density generated in glass materials upon laser irradiation will be addressed with reviewing the existing theoretical results and experimental evaluations based on application of the Drude theory. The results of modeling will be presented obtained {{on the basis of the}} Maxwell’s equations supplemented with the equations describing electron plasma generation and the laser-induced electric current. We will demonstrate that the model allows following important features of laser beam propagation in the regimes of tight focusing and dense electron plasma generation when unidirectional approximations such as the non-linear Schrödinger equation do not provide adequate description. Based on this model we have studied spatiotemporal dynamics of laser beam propagation with self-focusing, free electron generation, and plasma-induced defocusing on the example of fused silica glass under particular irradiation regimes employed for laser direct writing. As a result, the geometry of the laser energy absorption zone is determined and the glass temperature is mapped which may be foreseen at the end of electron – glass matrix relaxation. This, in turn, allows estimating the laser-induced stress levels and making conclusions on the routes of glass modification. Finally, based on the performed analysis, we consider the energy <b>balance,</b> <b>matching</b> the free electron energy and temperature with several threshold values (melting, plastic deformation, material failure with void formation, sublimation). *This research is supported by Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship grant of the corresponding author, No. 272919...|$|E

A recent {{observational}} study {{is used to}} illustrate two recent methodolog-ical proposals, namely optimal matching with 8 ̆ 5 ne balance and sensitivity analysis for uncommon but dramatic responses to treatment. 1. <b>Matching</b> with Fine <b>Balance</b> 1. 1. What is 8 ̆ 5 ne balance? Fine balance constrains an optimal <b>match</b> to exactly <b>balance</b> the marginal distributions of a nominal variable, perhaps one with many levels, placing no restrictions on who is matched to whom. The nominal variable might have many categories, like zip code, or the direct product of several nominal variables. Propensity scores balance covariates stochastically, but this may be inadequate for a nominal variable with many levels. Use in conjunction with calipers on the propensity score, a version of a Mahalanobis distance, possibly penalties for additional constraints. 1. 2. How do you construct an optimal 8 ̆ 5 nely <b>balanced</b> <b>match?</b> The assignment algorithm [2] takes a matrix of distances and 8 ̆ 5 nds the pairing of rows and columns that minimizes the total distance within pairs. The problem is not trivial because two rows may want the same column. For an nn matrix, {{it is possible to}} solve the optimal assignment problem in O n 3 arithmetic operations, which is the same order as for multiplying two n n matrices in the conventional way. In R, the pairmatch function in Ben Hansons [5] optmatch package solves the assignment problem. In SAS OR, proc assign solves the assignment problem. Hansens optmatch package calls Bertsekas [2] Fortran code. To construct a 8 ̆ 5 nely <b>balanced</b> <b>match,</b> the distance matrix is patterned {{in such a way that}} the proper numbers of controls are deleted. Proposition 1 in [12] shows that this procedure produces a minimum distance match subject to the constraint that 8 ̆ 5 ne balance is achieved. A toy example is given in the other handout.
