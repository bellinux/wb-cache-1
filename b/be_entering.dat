5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E

5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled it would <b>be</b> <b>entering.</b> If a boat was foundering, salvors would {{step in and}} help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E
5|$|Mu Arae has a listed {{spectral}} type of G3IVV. The G3 part {{means the}} star {{is similar to the}} Sun (a G2V star). The star may <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> the subgiant stage of its evolution as it starts to run out of hydrogen in its core. This is reflected in its uncertain luminosity class, between IV (the subgiants) and V (main sequence dwarf star stars like the Sun).|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E

5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they {{began to think about}} {{what had happened to the}} characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{were again}} reactivated on 1 December 2006 at Fort Drum, by reflagging 2nd Brigade, 78th Division (Training Support). It {{was one of}} 16 reserve brigades to be activated {{for the purpose of}} training. The brigade, which is headquartered at Fort Drum and is subordinate to the First Army Division East, is responsible for early stages of training for other reserve soldiers who have been alerted for deployment. The brigade offers the opportunity for veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom to use their skills to train new soldiers who will <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> the field of operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This training includes convoy live-fire training exercises, and techniques in dealing with improvised explosive devices, which are the primary cause of casualties in the operations.|$|E

30|$|Multiple {{regression}} analyses and moderated method {{were used to}} test the above proposed direct and interactive hypotheses. A five-step hierarchical analysis was conducted. In hierarchical regression method, each set of independent variables <b>is</b> <b>entered</b> into separate blocks for analysis and the incremental changes of the R 2 statistic and the β coefficients are calculated. The control variables <b>were</b> first <b>entered</b> and then knowledge management capabilities (KMC) variable <b>was</b> <b>entered</b> in the second step. Moderating variables that are ED and LC <b>were</b> <b>entered</b> in the third step. The two-way interaction terms (KMC × ED) and (KMC × LC) <b>were</b> <b>entered</b> in the fourth step.

5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
5|$|After Coates left, the {{orchestra}} reverted to its preferred practice of engaging numerous guest conductors {{rather than a}} single principal conductor. Among the guests were Elgar, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Serge Koussevitzky; soloists in the 1920s included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Schnabel and the young Yehudi Menuhin. Revenues were substantial, and {{the orchestra}} seemed to many to <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> into a golden age. In fact, for lack of any serious competition in the 1920s, the LSO allowed its standards of playing to slip. In 1927 the Berlin Philharmonic, under Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the poor standards then prevailing in London. Both the BBC and Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways. In 1929 the BBC began recruiting for the new BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult. The prospect of joining a permanent, salaried orchestra was attractive enough to induce some LSO players to defect. The new orchestra immediately received enthusiastic reviews that contrasted starkly with the severe press criticisms of the LSO's playing. According to the critic W J Turner the LSO's problem was not that its playing had deteriorated, but that it had failed {{to keep up with}} the considerable improvements in playing achieved over the past two decades by the best European and American orchestras.|$|E

25|$|The HDP was {{described}} by its founding chairpersons as a party that aims to eliminate the exploitation of labour and to fundamentally re-establish a democracy in which honourable and humanitarian individuals can live together as equal citizens.

Gök claimed that any political movement with similar aims to the HDK that had not merged with the party was more than welcome to do so. However, Önen claimed that the HDP would <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> elections as an individual party and not as part of a wider electoral alliance, adding that the party is itself formed of a wide coalition of political forces in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Government, {{bankruptcy}} and general auctions are amongst {{the most common}} auctions to be found today. A government auction is simply an auction held {{on behalf of a}} government body generally at a general sale. Here one may find a vast range of materials that have to be sold by various government bodies, for example: HM Customs & Excise, the Official Receiver, the Ministry of Defence, local councils and authorities, liquidators, as well as material put up for auction by companies and members of the public. Also in this group you will find auctions ordered by executors who are entering the assets of individuals who have perhaps died in testate (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. One of the most interesting bodies to look out for at auction is HM Customs & Excise who may <b>be</b> <b>entering</b> at auction various items seized from smugglers, fraudsters and racketeers.|$|E
