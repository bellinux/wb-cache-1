50|$|Islam has Quranic {{restrictions}} on food, {{such as how}} the meat is prepared. Halal meat is required in Islam, prepared by ritual slaughter that involves cutting the jugular veins <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> with a sharp knife. This leads to death, through <b>bleeding,</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal.</b> Meat from <b>animals</b> that die <b>of</b> natural causes or accident is not allowed, unless necessary.

50|$|Electrical {{stunning}} is done {{by sending}} an electric current through the brain and/or heart <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> before slaughter. Current passing through the brain induces an immediate but non-fatal general convulsion that produces unconsciousness. Current passing through the heart produces an immediate cardiac arrest that also leads shortly to unconsciousness and death. It is a controversial subject however. With chickens for example, overstunning leads to bone fractures and/or electrocution which prevents <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal.</b> This negatively affects {{the quality of the}} meat, and therefore understunning is an attractive practice for slaughterhouses.|$|R
40|$|For generations, nomadic herders {{have been}} {{learning}} to manage herd health, particularly in dromedaries {{because of their}} great value. Owing to the unavailability of veterinary services, camel herders in remote areas have been developing their own pharmacopoeia and veterinary techniques. The <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> sick <b>animals</b> is a common treatment, as Tuareg herders believe that 'tainted blood' (izni) {{is the cause of}} many conditions. Several surgical techniques are also used, such as excision of calcified sublingual cord. The remedies mentioned in this survey are derived from Maerua crassifolia, Boscia senegalensis, Acacia raddiana, Cucumis prophetarum, Calotropis procera, Ricinus communis, Citrullus colocynthis, green tea, millet, tobacco and onions. Artificial elements are also used for treatment of animals: Powders collected from batteries, various haircare or skincare creams, crushed glass, insecticides or motor oil belong to their pharmacopoeia. This broadmindedness allows the introduction of modern veterinary medicine. Factors such as the lack of real production objectives constitute limits to this progress, however. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Genetic {{studies of}} free-ranging {{primates}} have been seriously impeded by difficulties of sampling tissues, including the undesirability <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> habituated <b>animals,</b> <b>of</b> transporting frozen samples to the laboratory, {{and of the}} inherent inadequacies of accessible variation including allo-zymes, mtDNA RFLP patterns and DNA fingerprints. We have developed methods of non-invasive DNA sampling and DNA-level genotyping which, when combined with a hierarchical analysis of mtDNA sequences and hypervariable nDNA simple sequence repeat (microsatellite) loci size length polymorphisms, facilitate the resolution of most questions at the individual, social group (communi-ty), population, and species (phylogenetic) levels. This approach, based on DNA amplified from shed hair, represents an important new tool for the acquisition of genetic information and will facilitate the study and management of both captive and free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Our hier-archical analysis of population genetics of chimpanzees has revealed high historical levels of gene flow and large effective population sizes, as well as substantial divergence between the West African subspecies and chimpanzees from central and East Africa. At the community level, closer elatedness among philopatric males than among females upports the view that kin selection has been an evolu-tionary force shaping male-male cooperation i this species. Results from our study of the now rela-tively isolated Gombe community suggest hat habitat fragmentation affects population genetic structure and possibly population viability.

40|$|Although {{administration}} of 17 beta-estradiol (estrogen) following trauma-hemorrhage attenuates {{the elevation of}} cytokine production and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in epidermal keratinocytes, whether the salutary effects of estrogen are mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) -alpha. or ER-beta is not known. To determine which estrogen receptor is the mediator, we subjected C 3 H/HeN male mice to trauma-hemorrhage (2 -cm midline laparotomy and <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animals</b> to a mean blood pressure of 35 mmHg and maintaining that pressure for 90 min) followed by resuscitation with Ringer`s lactate (four times the shed blood volume) At the middle of resuscitation we subcutaneously injected ER-alpha agonist propyl pyrazole trial (PPT; 5 mu g/kg), ER-beta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN; 5 mu g/kg), estrogen (50 mu g/kg), or ER antagonist ICI 182, 780 (150 mu g/kg). Two hours after resuscitation, we isolated keratinocytes, stimulated them with lipopolysaccharide for 24 In (5 mu g/mL for maximum cytokine production), and measured the production of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, IL- 12, and INF-alpha and the activation of MAPK. Keratinocyte cytokine production markedly increased and MAPK activation occurred following trauma-hemorrhage but were normalized by {{administration of}} estrogen, PPT and DPN. PPT and DPN administration were equally effective in normalizing the inflammatory response of keratinocytes, indicating that both ER-alpha. and ER-beta mediate the salutary effects of estrogen on kerotinocytes after trauma-hemorrhage.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was {{determination}} of the rate <b>of</b> <b>bleeding,</b> abortion, and ectopic pregnancy in three methods of treatment of infertility in patients with different ages and realization of the predictive value <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> result. Methods: This study was done prospectively on 252 female patients who had become pregnant through infertility treatment at the IVF ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital (Ahwaz). They were followed {{until the end of the}} 20 th week of pregnancy. Three groups of patients included 100 patients who had become pregnant through induction ovulation, 122 patients who had become pregnant through IUI and 30 patients who had become pregnant through IVF. Results: Group I(Pregnant women via induction Ovulation) : 37 % had <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 35 % were aborted. 63 % did not have <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 11 % were aborted and one EP was detected as well. 40 % <b>of</b> the <b>bleeding</b> cases were younger than 30 years old and 29 % of them were older then 30 years. The rate of abortion in this group was 20 % and EP was 1 %. The highest abortion rate was detected inpatients older than 36 years. Group II: Pregnant women via IUI: 37 % had <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 31 % had abortion. 63 % didn’t have <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 10 % had abortion and 3 cases had EP. The rate of abortion was 18 % and EP 3 % The rate of abortion increased with age but the rate <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> stayed constant. Group III: Pregnant women via IVF: 36 % had <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 27 % had abortion. 64 % didn’t have <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 10. 5 % had abortion. The rate of abortion was 17 % and EP 6. 6 %. All of them were greater than 30 years old. The rate <b>of</b> abortion and <b>bleeding</b> was not different in three groups and did not disagree with world’s statistics. Conclusion: The rate of EP in IVF group was higher than other groups but similar to world’s data (2 - 8 %). The rate <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> didn’t increase with age. However, bleeding in all ages and groups could predict a 2. 5 - 3 fold increase in the rate of abortion (PV = 0. 008, 0. 014 and 0. 05 in three groups). Also, 11 % of all abortions were without bleeding...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPalpation of the {{indwelling}} angiographic catheter inserted before {{operation to}} localize obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin during laparotomy {{has rarely been}} reported in the literature. PurposeThe purpose of the study is to investigate the role of palpable indwelling angiocatheter inserted before operation in localizing obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin during laparotomy. MethodsBetween January 2003 and December 2010, seven patients who had a clinical impression <b>of</b> obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin and angiographic extravasation from the mesenteric artery had an angiocatheter inserted into the distal mesenteric branch. During laparotomy the catheter was palpated to guide subsequent resection of the intestine. The clinical outcomes of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsDuring laparotomy the retained catheter failed to be palpated in one patient. Six patients underwent segmental resection of intestine under guidance of the palpated catheter. All six patients had positive identification <b>of</b> small bowel <b>bleeding.</b> The yield rate of intraoperative localization was 86 % (6 out of 7). Two of the six patients ceased bleeding after operation, but died of underlying disease progression. Four of the six patients had an uneventful postoperative clinical course without recurrent bleeding after a median follow-up period of 25 months. ConclusionPalpation of the indwelling angiographic catheter selectively left before operation is effective for precisely locating obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin during laparotomy...|$|R
