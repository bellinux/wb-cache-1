Mets Manager Terry Collins remarked, [...] "I've never seen anything like this. Never. I've seen some dominant pitching, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> what he's going through right now." [...] Hall of Fame Pitcher and fellow knuckleballer Phil Niekro commented on Dickey, [...] "I had a few streaks, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> he's going through. I don't know if any other knuckleballer has ever been on a hot streak like he has been. He is just dynamite right now." ...|$|E

Peterson and wife built and operated the Peterson Hotel. As the mineral-rich mountain springs of Appalachia were thought to have health-restoring qualities, Carson Springs developed into an early tourist resort. The establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934 brought a still greater influx of tourists to Newport, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the tourism explosion that occurred in neighboring Sevier County.|$|E

2500|$|Reports {{of abuse}} are, however, conspicuously missing in primary {{documents}} authored by eyewitnesses {{immediately after the}} event. Colonel Hugh McLeod did not mention any abuse in his report of March 20, 1840 (commenting on the intelligence of the girl <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> a missing nose), and neither did any other Texas officials at the time, nor Matilda Lockhart's own sister-in-law in a letter written to her mother shortly after the release. Anderson writes: [...] "While published in the 1890s, this description {{has been used by}} historians to claim that the massacre came about {{as a result of the}} justifiable rage of Texas men. Yet none of the Texas officials claimed this to be the case at the time; evidence of abuse is conspicuously missing in the primary documents. Maverick may have exaggerated Lockhart's condition because of the growing criticism of Texas in the American and European Press. The most significant source on Matilda's condition is a brief statement made in a letter by her sister-in-law, Catherine Lockhart, who was in San Antonio.

2500|$|After his {{football}} career ended, Ortmann accepted {{a job with}} a Chicago nonferrous metals company owned by former Michigan All-American Ernie Vick. Ortmann retired in 1991 and moved to Savannah, Georgia. He was married to his high school sweetheart from Milwaukee, Betty Ortmann; they had four children. They settled in Glen Ellyn where, Chuck established a youth football program. Together with Tom Hoffman, Chuck coached both the Churchill Blue Raiders and Glen Ellyn Rams. During the Rams' first year, Larry Krupp served as student manager of the team. In 2004, Ortmann was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. Asked about the honor, Ortmann modestly said: “When fans start talking about putting an all-time Michigan team together, I think they're wrong to pick someone from the old era. I led the Big Ten one year with 750 yards running and passing. A guy like John Navarre has as many yards and passes in a game as I did in a season. Guys I played with were as good as they come, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the players today. Dominic Tomasi was a lineman at 5-8 and 180 pounds. They have cheerleaders that big today.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of baseball in Canada during Walker's youth was minuscule {{in contrast to}} the following he would help spawn related to his later success with the Montreal Expos. [...] Previously, Canadian baseball luminaries included Tip O'Neill, the first Canadian to win a Triple Crown back in 1887, and Ferguson Jenkins, Canada's first selectee to the American Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991. [...] It was Walker who would help dramatically increase the profile of the sport in a hockey-mad nation. [...] Part of the factor was Canada's short summers, so it is more challenging to play outdoors than in the United States. [...] Recalled Walker later in his major league career, “I’d never seen a forkball, never seen a slider. [...] I didn’t know they existed. [...] I had never really seen a good curveball. [...] In Canada, as a kid, we’d play 10 baseball games a year. [...] Fifteen, tops. [...] Some pitchers had a thing they’d call a spinner, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> this. [...] Baseball just wasn’t big. [...] The weather was against it. [...] Nobody ever played baseball thinking about making the major leagues." [...] He was also unaware of many of the rules, attesting to his lack of experience playing when he turned a professional.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prominent}} Penateka Peace Chief {{and medicine}} man Mukwooru ("Spirit Talker") {{was in charge}} of the delegation. The Comanche chiefs at the meeting had brought along one white captive, and several Mexican children who had been captured separately. The white captive was Matilda Lockhart, a 16-year-old girl who had been held prisoner for over a year and a half. [...] Mary Maverick, who helped care for the girl, wrote almost 60 years after the event that Matilda Lockhart had been beaten and raped, and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the 1890s. Reports of abuse are, however, conspicuously missing in primary documents authored by eyewitnesses immediately after the event. Neither Col. Hugh McLeod mentioned any abuse in his report of March 20, 1840 (commenting on the intelligence of the girl, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> a missing nose) nor any other Texas officials at the time nor Matilda Lockhart's own sister-in-law, who was in San Antonio, in a letter written to her own mother shortly after the release.

2500|$|With Washington {{clinging}} to a 4-3 lead, Max Scherzer came in on short rest to pitch {{the top of the}} fifth inning for the Nationals – his first relief appearance since the 2013 American League Division Series, when he was with the Detroit Tigers – and quickly got two outs; Cubs officials in the stands later told the press that they were preparing for Scherzer to pitch three or four lockdown innings and preserve Washington′s lead late into the game. Then the inning took a bizarre turn and descended into disaster for Washington. Scherzer gave up consecutive singles to Willson Contreras and pinch-hitter Ben Zobrist and a bases-clearing double to Addison Russell that gave the Cubs a 5-4 lead. [...] The Nationals intentionally walked Jason Heyward, and then Scherzer struck out [...] second baseman Javier Báez for what should have been the third out. However, the third strike got past Wieters, and Báez ran to first on the passed ball. Rather than hold the ball at home to prevent the Cubs from scoring, Wieters tried to throw out Báez at first, and his throw went into right field, allowing Russell to score, Heyward to advance to third, and Báez to reach second, and giving Chicago a 6-4 lead. Wieters asked the umpires to declare the ball dead and the play a strikeout on the grounds of offensive interference, claiming Báez's bat had hit him {{in the back of the}} head on the backswing – a contention confirmed by video evidence – but the umpires made a controversial ruling that even if the bat had struck Wieters, it did not interfere with the play and did not merit a ruling that the ball was dead, and they let the play stand. Next, Cubs pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella reached first base on a catcher's interference call against Wieters, loading the bases, and Scherzer followed that by hitting Jon Jay in the foot with a pitch, sending him to first and forcing in Heyward from third to increase Chicago′s lead to 7-4. Kris Bryant returned to the plate as the tenth Cubs batter of the inning, and popped out on Scherzer′s 28th pitch to bring the shocking inning to a close. After the game, Cubs manager Joe Maddon described the inning as [...] "bizarro world," [...] and Scherzer said, [...] "I′m sure I′ve been in some crazy stuff before, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] It was the first time in recorded MLB history, a total of some 2.73 million half-innings, that an intentional walk, a passed-ball strikeout, catcher′s interference, and a hit batsman had ever occurred in a single half-inning.|$|E
