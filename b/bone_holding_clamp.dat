50|$|Sabamobil was a {{magnetic}} tape audio cartridge format, made by SABA {{and came to}} the market in 1964. It used already available four-track ¼ inch tape on 3-inch rolls (= 7.62 cm), with two mono channels per side, using a tape speed of 3¾ IPS (~ 9.5 cm/s), and was compatible with reel-to-reel audio tape recording except the against remove secured ends of the tape in the reel. The cartridge could be opened without the need of any tools by removing two <b>holding</b> <b>clamps.</b> Tape head and capstan were placed between the reels.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a deep drawing die (1) with a top die and a bottom die (2, 3), wherein the top die (2) has a <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) and the bottom die (3) has a die plate (3 a), and wherein at least one device (6), with which {{the distance between the}} <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) and the die plate (3 a) can be modified in portions or partially, is arranged in a flange region. The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a top die and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) and die plate (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the die plate (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between die plate (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|R

The fossil was found in 1927 at Kents Cavern a limestone cave in Torquay, Devon, England. The Maxilla was uncovered at a depth of 10 ft and was located directly beneath a key ‘granular stalagmite’ at the site, which was used as a datum during excavations undertaken between 1926 and 1941 by the Torquay Natural History Society. The discovery of the KC4 maxilla was important because it became the earliest direct dated Anatomically Modern human (AMH) fossil yet discovered from a Northwestern European site. [...] Moreover the date obtained via a Bayesian statistical-modelling method provides evidence for the coexistence of anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals.|$|R

5|$|The skull was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that as it closed, the <b>bones</b> <b>holding</b> the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.|$|R
40|$|Preservation of intact macromolecules and geochemical {{signals in}} fossil bones is mainly {{controlled}} by the extent of post-mortem interaction between bones and sediment pore waters. Trace elements such as lanthanum are added to bone post-mortem from pore waters, and where uptake occurs via a simple process of diffusion and adsorption, the elemental distribution {{can be used to}} assess the relative extent of bone-pore water interaction and rate of recrystallisation. Distribution profiles can be parameterised effectively using simple exponential equations, and the extent of bone–water interaction compared within and between sites. In this study, the distribution of lanthanum within bone was determined by laser ablation ICP–MS in 60 archaeological and fossil bones from Pleistocene and Cretaceous sites. The rates of recrystallisation and potential for preservation of intact biogeochemical signals vary significantly within and between sites.
