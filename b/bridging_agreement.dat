40|$|Recommendations and Guiding Principles as necessary. Section III of the 1999 report, {{entitled}} “Improving Market Practices and Conventions, ” {{focused on}} three broad areas: improvements in documentation policies and practices, {{with a special}} emphasis on timelines; improvements in documentation content, with special attention to close-out and valuation issues and the basis risk arising from inconsistencies in standard forms of industry documentation; and improvements in collateral management practices. The recommendations shared two common goals: to improve a creditor’s {{ability to deal with}} failing counterparties in a timely manner, and to enhance the market’s ability to contain the risks of failures of large, leveraged participants. The 1999 report led to the establishment of the Global Documentation Steering Committee, whose mission is to implement the documentation-related recommendations contained in Section III. In particular, the GDSC’s objective is to carry out the CRMPG’s 1999 mandate by minimizing ”documentation basis risk ” — the risk that market, credit and legal risk will be exacerbated by disparities in documentation — in the over-thecounter markets. Much progress has been made since 1999, but much remains to be done. First, a suite of robust, contractual tools to reduce documentation basis risk has been developed. These tools include recommendations made by the GDSC as part of its documentation harmonization efforts, the development of the Bond Market Association’s Cross-product Master Agreements and the publication of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement and the 2001 ISDA <b>Bridge</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Although these contractual tool...|$|R

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} effects modulating the conformational {{behavior and}} the rate of intramolecular dissociative electron transfer in phthalimide-Aibn-peroxide peptides (n) 0 - 3) have been studied by an integrated density functional/continuum solvent model. We found that three different orientations of the phthalimide ring are possible, labeled ¼hel, ¼C 7, and ¼pII. In the condensed phase, they are very close in energy when the system is neutral and short. When the peptide chain length increases and the system is negatively charged, ¼hel becomes instead the most stable conformer. Our calculations confirm that the 310 -helix is the most stable secondary structure for the peptide bridge. However, upon charge injection in the phthalimide end of the phthalimide-Aib 3 -peroxide, the peptide bridge can adopt an R-helix conformation as well. The study of the dependence of the frontier orbitals on the length and on the conformation of the peptide <b>bridge</b> (in <b>agreement</b> with experimental indications) suggests that for n) 3 the process could be influenced by a 310 f R-helix conformational transition of the peptide chain...|$|R

With the successful creation of province-wide post-secondary agreements, students would attend university for two years, significantly cutting tuition costs.

There is also a valid concern that only those universities who are in need of more student applications, such as the small to mid-size universities, will be more willing to cooperate with college programs.

Over the 11 -ns trajectory, the transition recapitulates the slide-first, roll-later mechanism, is opposed by DNA electrostatics, and is favored by an increasing amount of condensed sodium ions.

The number of hydrogen bonds between water and DNA remains constant during the transition, but there is a 40 % {{increase in the number of}} water <b>bridges,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the principle of economy of hydration.

Structures {{of the wild}} type and its organophilic and thermophilic counterparts are presented at resolutions of 1. 5 Å, 1. 6 Å, and 2. 0 Å, respectively. These structures identify groups of interacting mutations and demonstrate how {{directed evolution}} can traverse complex fitness landscapes. Early-generation mutations stabilize flexible loops not visible in the wild-type structure {{and set the stage}} for further beneficial mutations in later generations.

40|$|While {{research}} has shown that joint ventures contribute more strongly to a firm’s innovativeness than contractual agreements, technology alliances are often governed by contractual <b>agreements.</b> <b>Bridging</b> alliance governance and partner selection research, this paper suggests how these apparently contradictory findings are fundamentally interrelated. By prevailing research, firms with joint ventures should be more innovative than those with contractual agreements. But as compared with contractual agreements, joint ventures will also reduce firms’ propensity for novel partners. Because novel partners enhance a firm’s innovativeness, joint ventures will therefore indirectly decrease its innovativeness. Finally, novel partners become more important when technological dynamism increases, which will in turn increase the innovative benefits of contractual agreements versus joint ventures. Application of a structural model to a panel of firms engaged in IT-related technology alliances during 1978 – 1999 generally supports the theory. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the behavioral and performance consequences of alliance governance...|$|R
40|$|A large {{literature}} {{exists on}} modeling {{the influence of}} sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins on {{the shape of the}} DNA double helix in terms of one or a few fixed constraints. This approach is inadequate for the many proteins that bind DNA sequence independently, and that are present in very large quantities rather than as a few copies, such as the nucleoid proteins in bacterial cells. The influence of such proteins on DNA configurations is better modeled in terms of a great number of mobile constraints on the DNA. Types of constraints that mimic the influence of various known non-specifically DNA binding proteins include DNA bending, wrapping, and bridging. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we here investigate the influence of (non-interacting) mobile DNA-protein-DNA bridges on the configurations of a 1000 bp piece of linear DNA, for both homogeneous DNA and DNA with an intrinsic planar bend. Results are compared to experimental data on the bacterial nucleoid protein H-NS that forms DNA-protein-DNA <b>bridges.</b> In <b>agreement</b> with data on H-NS, we find very strong positioning of DNA-protein-DNA bridges in the vicinity of planar bends. H-NS binds to DNA very cooperatively, but for non-interacting bridges we only find a moderate DNA-induced clustering. Finally, {{it has been suggested that}} H-NS is an important contributor to the extreme condensation of bacterial DNA into a nucleoid structure, but we find only a moderate compaction of DNA coils with increasing numbers of non-interacting bridges.
