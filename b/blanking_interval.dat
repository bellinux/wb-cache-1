25|$|In 1971, CAL {{engineer}} John Adams {{created a}} design and proposal for UK broadcasters. His configuration contained all the fundamental elements of classic Teletext including pages of 24 rows with 40 characters each, page selection, sub pages {{of information and}} vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> data transmission.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Ceefax and ORACLE systems and their successors in the UK, the {{teletext}} signal is transmitted as part of the ordinary analogue TV signal but concealed from view in the Vertical <b>Blanking</b> <b>Interval</b> (VBI) television lines which do not carry picture information. The teletext signal is digitally coded as 45-byte packets, so the resulting rate is 7,175 bits per second per used lines (41 7-bit 'bytes' per line, on each of 25 frames per second).|$|E
50|$|The {{parameters}} {{defined by}} standard include horizontal blanking and vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals,</b> horizontal frequency and vertical frequency (collectively, pixel clock rate or video signal bandwidth), and horizontal/vertical sync polarity.|$|R
25|$|The {{technology}} {{works by}} adding additional {{lines to the}} video signal. In the NTSC video standard, blank lines (vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals)</b> that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology.|$|R
50|$|The Rec. 601 signal can be {{regarded}} as if it is a digitally encoded analog component video signal, and thus the sampling includes data for the horizontal and vertical sync and <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals.</b> Regardless of the frame rate, the luminance sampling frequency is 13.5 MHz. The samples are uniformly quantized using 8 or 10 bit PCM codes in the YCbCr domain.|$|R
25|$|A {{closely related}} service is the Video Program System (VPS), {{introduced}} in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval.</b> It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily {{the date and}} time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. Video recorders can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR. VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters {{can use it to}} mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.|$|E

2500|$|Teletext (or {{broadcast}} teletext) is {{a television}} {{information retrieval service}} created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by the Philips Lead Designer for VDUs, John Adams. Teletext {{is a means of}} sending pages of text and simple geometric shapes from mosaic blocks to a VBI decoder equipped television screen by use of a number of reserved vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> lines that together form the dark band dividing pictures horizontally on the television screen. [...] It offers a range of text-based information, typically including news, weather and TV schedules. Paged subtitle (or closed captioning) information is also transmitted within the television signal.|$|E

40|$|When {{asked to}} {{identify}} 2 visual targets (T 1 and T 2 for the 1 st and 2 nd targets, respectively) embedded in a sequence of distractors, observers will often fail to identify T 2 when it appears within 200 - 500 ms of T 1 -an effect called the attentional blink. Recent work shows that attention does not blink when the task is to encode a sequence of consecutive targets, suggesting that distractor interference plays a causal role in the attentional blink. Here, however, the authors show that an attentional blink occurs {{even in the absence}} of distractors, with 2 letter targets separated by a <b>blank</b> <b>interval.</b> In addition, the authors found that the impairment for identification of the 2 nd of 2 targets separated by a <b>blank</b> <b>interval</b> is substantially attenuated either when the intertarget interval is filled with additional target items or when the 2 nd target is precued by an additional target. These findings show that the root cause of the blink lies in the difficulty of engaging attention twice within a short period of time for 2 temporally discrete target events. © 2009 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|Striate and extrastriate neurons present {{short-term}} synaptic {{depression and}} facilitation {{in response to}} brief stimulations. Recent studies have shed light on some possible relationships between these short-term forms of neural plasticity and patterns of psychophysical behavior. It {{has been shown that}} a brief adaptation to directional motion biases the perceived direction of a subsequently presented ambiguous test pattern towards the same direction to that of the adaptation [rapid visual motion priming (rVMP) ], but only after brief adaptation-test <b>blank</b> <b>intervals.</b> Increasing the adaptation duration, the perceived motion direction of the ambiguous test pattern is biased towards the opposite direction [rapid motion aftereffect (rMAE) ]. In our study we used contracting and expanding circular gratings to selectively elicit activity at the level in which neurons respond to optic flow components (ie, MT and MST neurons). We attempted to assess whether the rapid effects exist and, if so, their timescale. Results revealed strong rMAEs, a long lasting facilitation that arises gradually with intermediate and long <b>blank</b> <b>intervals</b> (perceptual sensitization), but we did not observe rVMP. We interpreted results on the basis of competition between coexistent forms of short- and long-term synaptic depression and facilitation implemented at different visual cortical circuitries...|$|R
40|$|During {{continuous}} {{viewing of}} multistable figures, {{such as the}} Necker cube, perception alternates between equally valid solutions. So how can perceptual experience be stable given that various alternative interpretations of the same physical stimulus are available? Previous demonstrations with bistable stimuli have revealed that a repetitive intermittent presentation leads to a stabilisation of the percept. Recent research findings suggested that interleaved presentation of several ambiguous stimuli does not disrupt the perceptual stabilisation of each reversible pattern, suggesting that perceptual 'memory stores' coexist independently for each representation. Interference effects were only obtained for structurally similar stimuli. In the present study, we adopted Maier et al's interleaved presentation paradigm to investigate the effects of interfering ambiguous patterns upon transition probability and the stabilisation process. Rather than manipulating structural similarities between interleaved ambiguous stimuli, we sequentially presented ambiguous figures that share equivalent reversal processes such as figure - ground segregation or perspective reversal. The results reveal that perceptual dominance time of the ambiguous test stimulus decreases compared to periods during which a <b>blank</b> <b>interval</b> is presented, indicating an effect of interference from the distractor. Interaction between reversal processes influences the stabilisation of perception that is normally observed during repetitive intermittent presentation with <b>blank</b> <b>intervals...</b>|$|R

50|$|Historically, video frames were {{represented}} as analog waveforms in which varying voltages represented {{the intensity of}} light in an analog raster scan across the screen. Analog <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals</b> separated video frames {{in the same way}} that frame lines did in film.

This meant that a single video frame was usually not a good still picture of the scene, unless the scene being shot was completely still.|$|R
