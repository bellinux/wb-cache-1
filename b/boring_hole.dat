40|$|For cast-in-place piling for railway structures, {{usually the}} <b>Boring</b> <b>Hole</b> (BH) method with normal {{circulation}} boring or TBH method with reverse circulation boring is applied. Small-sized machines {{can be used}} in piling with normal circulation boring; thus, the piling has high workability in narrow spaces with low overhead clearance. On the other hand, slurry generally cannot be managed in that method. Furthermore, due to the drilling mechanism of that method, slime easily accumulates at the pile head and mud cake often adheres to bore walls, lowering bearing capacity of piles and reliability of pile body quality. For that reason, the reverse circulation boring method where pile reliability is greater is applied to piles of main structure in railway civil engineering, although larger machines than for normal circulation boring are used. Since work time and cost for foundation piling in small spaces between tracks accounts for a high percentage of the total in reverse circulation boring, shortening work time an...|$|E

40|$|Discolouration in {{the wood}} of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) was studied in a 60 -year-old birch stand in eastern Finland. Altogether 45 trees were {{analysed}} two and five years after sapping. The <b>boring</b> <b>hole</b> made for sapping caused a strongly flattened, conical- shaped discolouration column down-und upwards from the hole. The discolouration spread only very slightly in the radial or the crosswise directions, but increased rapidly in the longitudinal direction. In many trees the discolouration caused by the sapping hole joined with discolouration originating from branches and butt. After five years, the estimated volume of the discolored area was almost four times bigger in these trees. 486 microbial pure cultures were isolated (191 bacteria, 224 fungi, 77 yeasts or yeast-like fungi). The samples {{from the base of}} the tree contained a larger proportion of fungal isolates than samples from the highest point of discoloura-tion. The number of pure cultures containing bacteria and yeasts was less after five years than after two years since sapping. Even the samples from sound-looking wood con-tained microbes, mostly bacteria. Most of the identified fungi belonged to Phialophora sp. (especially Phialop-hora fastigiata). Penicillium sp. and Cladospora sp. were also common.

40|$|The Tenth International Symposium on Mitigation of Geo-{{disaster}}s in Asia Matsue Symposium Place: Shimane Civil Center, Matsue Date: 8 October 2012 Various {{types of}} soil disaster related with groundwater behaviour. Especially, flowing groundwater flows in very local area causes destabilization {{of the soil}} structure. It {{is very important for}} clarification of mechanism of the soil disasters. However, exploration of flowing groundwater in local area is very difficult because of heterogeneity of soil quality and groundwater condition. This paper has provided principle and measurement results of two types of exploring method of flowing groundwater. One-meter Depth Temperature method is developed to get information of flowing groundwater route reflected by the ground surface. One-meter Depth Temperature is simple, inexpensive and stable method to detect the local flowing groundwater. We can get information of existence of flowing groundwater by measuring one-meter depth soil temperature, simply. Multipoint Temperature Logging method is also developed. We can get information of vertical location of layers with flowing groundwater. <b>Boring</b> <b>hole</b> was used in Multipoint Temperature Logging method.

40|$|The {{practice}} of through-boring extends the service life of poles by protecting the pole from internal decay, but {{little is known}} about the effects of through-boring on the bending strength of utility poles. A preferred through-boring pattern was developed using current knowledge of preservative penetration, finite-element modeling, as well as the current literature on stress concentrations in circular members with diametral holes. Poles were subsequently through-bored and tested to determine if the <b>boring</b> <b>hole</b> size affected the bending strength of the poles when compared to a control group without any holes. The preferred pattern was a repeated staggered pattern with hole spacing 5 in. by 1 1 / 2 in. in the longitudinal and transverse direction, respectively, with a 2 -in. edge distance. This pattern was applied to poles with 1 / 4 -in, 1 / 2 -in., 3 / 4 -in., and 1 -in. diameter holes in a zone − 36 in. to + 24 in. about the groundline of Class 4 poles. Results showed a slight decrease in average bending strengths, defined as the modulus of rupture (MOR) values, with increasing hole size. However, lower parametric tolerance limits for the through-bored poles were equivalent to or greater than that for the control (no holes) for all but the largest hole size group. The through-boring pattern tested with the smaller hole sizes did not significantly reduce the strength of the pole in bending when used in the proposed through-boring pattern. The most practical hole size for production would be a 1 / 2 in. -diameter hole with the 5 by 1 1 / 2 in. staggered pattern with a 2 -in. edge distance...|$|E

30|$|Let a DS be {{lowering}} {{in a plane}} circular <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> Then, it slides along the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> bottom line and its axis line is a circle of a radius ρ + a, where ρ is the radius of the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> axis T and a is the system clearance. In sliding, the DS is subjected to action of gravity (f gr), contact (f cont), and friction (f fr) forces. In consequence of these forces, the DS can be compressed in some segments of its length where it can begin to buckle without losing its contact with the well wall. It is necessary to predict the critical states of the DS and to construct the modes of its stability loss.|$|R
30|$|Not long ago, rather shallow wells {{with simple}} {{outlines}} were drilled {{in oil and}} gas fields. However, at the present time, deeper and more complicated trajectories of <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> are designed in connection with exhaustion of easily accessible hydrocarbon sources. In 2015, the record 13.5  km horizontal <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> was drilled in the Sakhalin region, Russia. According to experts’ opinions, most of the substantial achievements in the power engineering of the current century are associated with this technical direction. Particularly, some {{are related to the}} pioneering investigation of industrial extraction of shale oil and gas, whose deposits in the world essentially exceed conventional reserves. However, as a rule, drilling of such <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> is attended by extraordinary phenomena bringing emergency situations. One of them is unstable bending buckling of a drill string (DS) in the channel of a curvilinear <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> (Brett et al. 1989; Dawson and Paslay 1984; Kyllingstad 1995; Sawaryn et al. 2006; Gulyayev et al. 2009; Gao and Liu 2013; Huang and Gao 2014; Gao and Huang 2015). This effect is associated with deterioration of conditions of contact interaction between the DS and the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> wall, enlargement of friction forces, impossibility of transferring the required axial force to the bit, and the DS lockup situation. To predict these effects and exclude them in practice, computer simulation should be employed.|$|R

40|$|Induced {{hydraulic}} {{fracture of}} strata during roof bolt installation is a potentially prevalent, but masked phenomenon within the underground coal industry. Previously reported resin testing programs (McTyre et al., 2014) {{examined the relationship}} between resin mixing effectiveness and varying <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> diameter. The methodology employed within this earlier test program facilitated a further critical area of research – the measurement of back pressures generated within the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> during standard rock bolt installation practices. Experimental data has indicated that fluid resin can be pressurised to levels where it exceeds the compressive strength of the strata, inducing hydraulic fracture within the immediate area of the bolting horizon. The routine cycle of roof bolting serves to propagate this effect, progressively fracturing and delaminating the roof during mine advancement. This masked phenomenon can lead to a perception of difficult ground conditions - mining efficiencies and costs are therefore affected, with increased need for additional support subsequently required to re-stabilise the inadvertently damaged roof. Further analysis of the parameters associated with resin bolt installation has now been conducted, assisting in the development of an empirical relationship between <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> pressure, <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and bolt insertion times. This relationship has been analysed for 15 : 1 ratio resins and 2 : 1 ratio resins, within 28 mm and 30 mm boreholes. Further to this, load transfer performance has been comparatively assessed for both 28 mm and 30 mm boreholes, suggesting that for 2 : 1 resins, acceptable resin mixing and load transfer can be obtained within a 30 mm <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> The combination of 2 : 1 resins, utilised within a 30 mm <b>bore</b> <b>hole,</b> may well provide the optimal solution {{to reduce the risk of}} hydraulic fracture in weaker strata during resin bolt installation...|$|R
50|$|Geological {{formations}} of {{shale gas}} are being explored {{as a new}} source of energy.

The technique is not without problems for the fracturing can affect aquifers causing contamination and deviation. To date efforts at production in Canada have been limited to exploratory wells.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} method of {{determining}} far-field principal stress magnitude and orientation using biaxial stress measurements made in a series of <b>bore</b> <b>holes.</b> Two novel developments were employed: one was a method for relating biaxial measurements from three <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> to the triaxial principal stress field; the other was a measurement technique that fully defines the biaxial stress field around a <b>bore</b> <b>hole,</b> independent of rock properties. To determine the triaxial principal stress field, a series of simultaneous equations describing biaxial measurements in terms of a random baseline coordinate system was developed. A least squares regression was then utilized to determine the coordinate system 2 ̆ 7 s stress field.
