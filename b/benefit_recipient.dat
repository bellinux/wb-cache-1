The findings support the idea that the stigma of receiving benefits can be contrasted with nostalgia for the social elements of employment. Utilizing the work of Goffman, the article focuses on how the stigma and shame felt at receiving sickness benefits {{for an extended period of}} time interacts with social networks and identity.

5000|$|In {{its last}} {{term of office}} New Labour began to phase out Incapacity Benefit {{and replace it with}} Employment and Support Allowance. At the same time the Work Capability Assessment became the gateway to the new out-of-work {{sickness}} benefit. The policy objectives for the new test were: to accentuate the positive by [...] "looking at what you can do, not what you can't do"; to take into account new disability legislation, changes in the workplace and developments in occupational health; to make the test more stringent; to assess most new claims in person rather than on paper; and, once the new test had bedded in, to use it to re-evaluate virtually every established sickness <b>benefit</b> <b>recipient.</b> To facilitate these last two objectives testing capacity was increased fivefold by employing nurses and physiotherapists to work alongside doctors, and a semi-structured interview technique based on a computer-generated template was used for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{who commit}} welfare fraud live under {{precarious}} circumstances {{and feel that}} they do not have much of a choice. Some belong to the new underclass - marked by low social status, limited education and inadequate qualifications - and do not easily find employment and are receptive to opportunities offered by their social network, which may include the [...] "informal economy." [...] The inflexibility of the system makes reporting short works unprofitable or inconvenient, which undermines some welfare recipients' belief in the legitimacy of the system. Many fraudsters find the type of jobs available to them incompatible with their responsibilities as caretakers. There are also studies which indicate that a majority of fraudsters are not motivated primarily by severe economic problems.

50|$|Since 1984 {{a portion}} of social {{security}} benefits are taxable, usually levied when a person has another source of income often from a separate pension/disability fund or from a spouse. State income tax laws generally exclude all social security benefits from taxable income.

Private disability insurance income is taxable if the original premiums for the benefit were paid by the employer; if they were paid by the individual, they are not taxable.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 long-term sickness <b>benefits</b> <b>recipients</b> in North-East England, {{this article focuses}} upon how individuals perceived and managed becoming ‘incapacitated’, particularly in relation to stigma and identity. The findings show that participants negotiated changes to their identity in varying ways – constructing new dimensions of self, validating their illness and pursuing aspirations. Importantly, the transition onto sickness benefits does not inevitably result in a shift to a negative identity. The term incapacity can include many realities, challenging the notion of sickness <b>benefit</b> <b>recipients</b> as being passively dependent. Instead, an active, sometimes very functional sense of self can {{be accompanied by a}} positive identity for recipients, which is especially important, in a context of the rhetoric surrounding ongoing welfare reform and sickness <b>benefits</b> <b>recipients</b> in the UK...|$|R
30|$|The {{eligibility}} conditions thus include various elements ranging from control/enforcement of job search and availability criteria to enhancement of qualifications to improve job-finding rates. These conditionalities have important implications, {{which can be}} seen by considering the limiting case of a participation requirement for an unemployment <b>benefit</b> <b>recipient.</b> That is, there is a requirement to participate in some programme to claim benefits. For the sake of argument, it is assumed that participation does not affect qualifications but only serves as an availability test. Participation in such a programme increases the opportunity costs of receiving benefits, which reduces both adverse selection and moral hazard problems related to individual search incentives.|$|E
30|$|Research on {{developed}} countries (primarily the United States) suggests that unemployment benefits {{play a significant}} role in consumption smoothing (for overview see Chetty and Finkelstein 2012). (Hamermesh and Slesnick 1995) find that the welfare of <b>benefit</b> <b>recipient</b> households was on average only 3 – 8 percent lower than the welfare of otherwise identical households. Gruber (1997) finds that in the absence of UI, average consumption expenditures would fall by 24 percent, given the US unemployment benefit design. Very few studies examine the consumption-smoothing effects of income support programs in developing countries. One notable study is Kugler (2005), showing that withdrawals from unemployment insurance savings accounts in Colombia increased consumption by non-employed household heads.|$|E

The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse {{unemployment}} benefit programmes in Malta over the period 1992 - 2005 and to examine the difference between in-work and out-of-work benefits in order to determine whether the tax-benefit system is financially rewarding.

30|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the rising exploitation rates is that social insurance dependency is “contagious”, e.g., because it becomes less stigmatizing to be a <b>benefit</b> <b>recipient</b> when recipiency is already widespread. This may be the source of what Lindbeck (1995) labeled “hazardous welfare-state dynamics”, whereby initially exogenous changes in exploitation rates are amplified over time through a social multiplier. Despite methodological difficulties, there is now convincing evidence that such multiplier effects are empirically important (Bertrand et al. 2000; Ichino and Maggi, 2000; Aizer and Currie, 2004; Hesselius et al. 2009; Åslund and Fredriksson, 2009; Rege et al. 2012; Markussen and Røed, 2012).
