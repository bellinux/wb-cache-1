Traditionally the pattern has been explored by plotting {{the number of species}} on the y-axis and the logarithm to the base two of the species <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> (<b>g)</b> on the x-axis. This yields a highly right skewed body size distribution with a mode centered near species with a mass ranging from 50-100 grams.

40|$|Background: Performing regular {{exercise}} {{is known to}} manifest a number of health benefits that mainly relate to cardiovascular and muscular adaptations to allow for greater oxygen extraction and utilization. There is increasing evidence that nutrient intake can affect the adaptive response to a single exercise bout, and that protein feeding is important to facilitate this process. Thus, the exercise-nutrient interaction may potentially lead to a greater response to training. The role of post-exercise protein ingestion in enhancing the effects of running-based endurance exercise training relative to energy-matched carbohydrate intervention remains to be established. Additionally, the influence of immediate versus overnight protein ingestion in mediating these training effects is currently unknown. The current protocol aims to establish whether post-exercise nutrient intake and timing would influence the magnitude of improvements during a prescribed endurance training program. Methods/Design: The project involves two phases with each involving two treatment arms applied in a randomized investigator-participant double-blind parallel group design. For each treatment, participants {{will be required to}} undergo six weeks of running-based endurance training. Immediately post-exercise, participants will be prescribed solutions providing 0. 4 grams per kilogram of <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> (<b>g</b> · kg - 1) of whey protein hydrolysate plus 0. 4 g · kg - 1 sucrose, relative to an isocaloric sucrose control (0. 8 g · kg - 1; Phase I).

Anthropometric, expired gas, venous blood and muscle biopsy samples will be obtained at baseline and following the six-week training period.

40|$|Introduction. The Advanced Stay Strong, Stay Healthy (ASSSH) {{program was}} {{developed}} in 2009 {{by a team of}} MU Extension Specialists to meet the increasing need for a follow-up program to the Stay Strong, Stay Healthy (SSSH) program. The goal of the program is to build on the fitness base acquired from SSSH by adding new and more complex exercises. The neuromuscular system quickly adapts to stressors and loads and must be constantly challenged for gains in strength, flexibility and balance to continue. Thus, it is necessary to alter the exercise routine regularly. Advanced SSSH is designed to challenge older adults in new and different ways to help staleness and plateaus, and to improve activities of daily living (ADL's). Loss of muscular strength, flexibility, and balance are strong predictors of falls in the elderly. Purpose. The primary purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of the MU Extension program Advanced Stay Strong, Stay Healthy. It was hypothesized that the program can improve physical parameters of health including strength, balance, and flexibility which indicate the risk of falling among seniors. Methods. Twenty eight older adults volunteered to participate in this study. Matched pairs t-tests were used to compare differences in measures of the physical indicators of strength, flexibility, and balance. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine exercise adherence and age effects on the increments in measures of the physical indicators of strength from pre to post. Dual X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were conducted before and after the 10 -week exercise intervention to identify changes in body composition (lean mass and fat mass) and changes in percent body fat (%BF). Results. Twenty three subjects (21 female, 2 male; 50 - 76 y) successfully completed the 10 week training protocol and were included in the analysis. Following a 10 -week structured strength program, participants significantly improved strength, flexibility, and balance (p< 0. 05). Results from the DXA scans indicated improvements in body weight and whole body composition ratio displayed by a decrease in body fat (g) and an increase in lean <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> (<b>g),</b> however, no significant differences were observed. Subjects showed a significant decrease in %BF following 10 weeks of programming. No significant changes in bone mineral content (BMC) or bone mass density (BMD) were observed. Conclusion. The community-based MU Extension program ASSSH can significantly improve muscular strength, flexibility, balance and, ultimately, reduce risk factors of falling among seniors. Although subjects showed statistically significant improvement in strength, flexibility and balance measures, 10 weeks appeared to be too short to achieve significant changes in BMC, BMD and changes in lean body mass and fat mass. Nevertheless, the positive trends observed in body composition and BMD suggest that analysis of a longer intervention period to elicit observable changes in bone turnover (i. e. 12 months or greater) is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Shriver, W. GregoryRapid {{anthropogenic}} {{environmental and}} landscape change broadly influences ecosystems, communities, and populations. This research {{is focused on}} the response of the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), a forest-breeding songbird, to effects of urbanization, habitat loss, and fragmentation. I tested hypotheses dealing with food resource use, genetic structure, and metapopulation dynamics associated with potentially limiting factors for breeding wood thrushes that have been suggested to be contributing to observed range-wide population declines over the past 50 years. These findings can improve our understanding of how limiting factors may be related to wood thrush population declines within urbanized and fragmented landscapes. This work is unique in that it builds upon an ongoing long-term study of wood thrushes in and near Newark, DE, and provides new insight into their breeding ecology. Using stable carbon (?? 13 C) and nitrogen (?? 15 N) isotopes, I demonstrated that wood thrush diets contained higher proportions of calcium-rich snails than was previously described. I also found that avian brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) is related to nestling diet, which may lead to negative effects on nestling development. I used five microsatellite markers to explore the effect of forest fragmentation on fine-scale genetic structure of wood thrushes. Despite relatively low levels of genetic differentiation among sites, I found patterns of genetic flow that were not well explained by inter-site distances (m). Like many songbird species, wood thrushes are socially monogamous, however paternity analysis of wood thrush nestlings revealed that 29 % of offspring were the result of extra-pair mating events. These findings suggest that wood thrush are potentially engaging in inter-site forays during the breeding season, or may be shifting breeding locations annually. Wood thrushes with nests closer to non-forested edges, male wood thrushes with longer wing chord (mm), and males with lower <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> (<b>g)</b> had a higher probability of having offspring through extra-pair matings. Finally, I modeled the metapopulation dynamics of wood thrushes within the study area by integrating several empirically-based approaches to test wood thrush population responses to conservation actions. I found that the probability of wood thrush site occupancy, survival, fecundity, and recruitment could be increased over the next 30 years by reducing the proportion of impervious surface within 500 m buffers around forest sites, and by removing brown-headed cowbirds from wood thrush breeding areas. However, only when these two conservation strategies were applied simultaneously, did simulated wood thrush populations attain positive annual growth rates. In summary, my findings suggest that cowbird parasitism is related to wood thrush nestling diet, and in general, wood thrushes {{do not appear to be}} calcium limited. Wood thrushes in and near Newark, DE are not experiencing loss of genetic diversity due to habitat fragmentation, and could benefit from reductions of impervious surface on the landscape and brown-headed cowbird parasitism rates. Collectively, my findings provide important new information that can help guide conservation strategies for wood thrushes breeding in the mid-Atlantic United States, a region where observed rates of breeding population declines are at their greatest.

Falling behind of the trial groups in relation to the control group in regard to the <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> at the end of the trial was by 0, 91 % group 2 and by 2, 89 % for group 3. Feed conversion ratio was the best in group 2, followed by control group, and the worst was the group 3 (1, 882; 1, 866; 1, 894, respectively). The lowest mortality rate was realized by chickens of the control group, followed by group 2 and group 3 (4, 00 %; 4, 33 %; 5, 33 %, respectively). The control group of chickens had the best production index value, followed by group 2 and the lowest value of the production index was established for chickens of group 3 (270, 95; 265, 18; 255, 63, respectively). It can be observed that the depression in trial groups was within the limits of toleration, which indicates that extruded rapeseed meal can be included in the diets for fattening chickens in ratio up t...|$|R

40|$|O cÃncer colorretal (CCR) Ã um dos mais comuns tumores malignos atualmente. Regimes Ã base de irinotecano (IRI) tÃm sido utilizados no tratamento do CCR e do CCR metastÃtico. Contudo, tais regimes estÃo associados ao surgimento de mucosite {{intestinal}} (MI), muitas vezes limitante do tratamento. A MI e a diarrÃia grave sÃo efeitos colaterais frequentes que podem atingir de 15 - 25 % dos pacientes em quimioterapia. No entanto, o manejo clÃnico destes efeitos secundÃrios ainda Ã parcialmente ineficaz. O estudo dos mecanismos e mediadores envolvidos na resposta imune no estado de pÃs sepse vem evidenciando que nesta condiÃÃo parece haver uma inibiÃÃo de eventos inflamatÃrios entre os quais a migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos. Dessa forma, o estado de pÃs-sepse poderia interferir no curso da MI induzida por IRI. Pretende-se avaliar os efeitos da imunomodulaÃÃo em animais sobreviventes de sepse grave no desenvolvimento das alteraÃÃes inflamatÃrias da MI induzida pelo IRI. Camundongos C 57 BL/ 6 machos, 20 - 25 g, foram divididos em 4 grupos (n= 5 - 8), submetidos ao modelo de ligaÃÃo e perfuraÃÃo do ceco (CLP) e tratados com ertapenem 20 mg/Kg i. p. 6 h depois da CLP e de 12 / 12 h por trÃs dias, para induzir aproximadamente 50 % de sobrevida. Animais submetidos Ã cirurgia mas nÃo Ã perfuraÃÃo do ceco (SHAM) receberam soluÃÃo salina (Sal, 5 mL/Kg, i. p.). Quinze dias apÃs CLP, os animais sobreviventes e animais do grupo SHAM receberam soluÃÃo salina (Sal, 5 ml/Kg, i. p.) durante 4 dias ou IRI (75 mg/kg, i. p.). A massa corpÃrea (g) foi mensurada diariamente. No 5 Â ou 7 Â dia, foi avaliada a contagem total de leucÃcitos (x 103 /ÂL) e a diarreia (escores). ApÃs a morte, o jejuno e o Ãleo foram recolhidos para a dosagem da mieloperoxidase (MPO), IL- 1 &# 946; e IL- 10 (pg/mL) e anÃlise histopatolÃgica, ANOVA/Bonferroni ou Kruskal Wallis/Dunn foram usados como testes estatÃsticos. P < 0, 05 foi aceito. Protocolo CEPA 84 &# 824; 2014. Animais pÃs-sÃpticos por CLP tratados com IRI apresentaram reduÃÃo dos escores de diarreia e atividade da MPO no 5 Â e 7 Â dia (diarreia 5 D: [0 (0 - 0) ]; 7 D: [0 (0 - 2) / MPO do jejuno e Ãleo, 5 D: 2, 96 Â 1, 01; 2, 35 Â 0, 76 e 7 D: 0, 42 Â 0, 14; 0, 92 Â 0, 19, respectivamente) quando comparados com os animais SHAM tratados com IRI (diarreia 5 D: 1 [0 - 1]; 7 D:[2, 5 (1 - 3) ] /MPO do jejuno e Ãleo, 5 D: 8, 16 Â 1, 48; 7, 96 Â 0, 96; 7 D: 2, 51 Â 0, 67; 2, 87 Â 0, 65, respectivamente). AlÃm disso, animais pÃs-sÃpticos tratados com IRI apresentaram reduÃÃo nos danos histopatolÃgicos no 5 Â e 7 Â dia (5 D no jejuno e Ãleo: [1 (1 â 3) ] e [1 (0 - 1) ]; e 7 D no Ãleo: [2 (1 - 3) ] em relaÃÃo a IRI (5 D no jejuno e Ãleo: [4 (2 - 4) ] e [4 (1 - 4) ] / 7 D: Ãleo [4 (3 - 4) ]) e aumento dos nÃveis da citocina IL- 10 (5 D no jejuno e Ãleo: 55, 80 Â 3, 42; 34, 45 Â 1, 87; 7 D: Ãleo: 133, 00 Â 20, 25) em comparaÃÃo com SHAM + IRI (5 D no jejuno e Ãleo: 34, 45 Â 1, 87; 6, 91 Â 3, 05; 7 D no Ãleo: 63, 67 Â 9, 08). No entanto, animais CLP + IRI nÃo tiveram alteraÃÃo da leucopenia induzida por IRI. Animais C 57 BL/ 6 pÃs-sÃpticos apresentaram reduÃÃo da lesÃo da mucosa intestinal e infiltraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos na MI induzida por IRI. Tal efeito pode ser consequente, entre outros, ao aumento de IL- 10. Nowadays the {{colorectal cancer}} (CRC) {{is one of}} the most common malignant tumors. Irinotecan have been used in the treatment of CRC and metastatic CRC. However, the treatment protocols are associated with the development of intestinal mucositis (IM), reaction that affects the therapy. The IM and severe diarrhea are common side effects that may reach 15 - 25 % of the patients undergoing chemotherapy and the clinical management of these effects is still partly ineffective. The study of the mechanisms and mediators involved in immune response in post-sepsis has provided evidences that in this condition seems to be an inhibition of inflammatory events including neutrophil migration. Thus, the post-sepsis could influence the course of MI induced by IRI. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of immunomodulation in the development of inflammatory changes of IM induced by Irinotecan in severe sepsis surviving animals. C 57 BL / 6 male mice, 20 - 25 g, were divided into 4 groups (n = 5 - 8) were subjected to the model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and treated with ertapenem 20 mg/kg i. p. 6 h after CLP and 12 / 12 h for three days to induce approximately 50 % of survival. Animals underwent surgery but not to puncture the cecum (SHAM) received saline (NaCl, 5 mL / kg, ip). Fifteen days after CLP, the surviving animals and animals of the SHAM group received saline (NaCl, 5 ml / kg, ip) for 4 days or Irinotecan (75 mg/kg, ip). The <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> (<b>g)</b> was measured every day. On the 5 th or 7 th day, total leukocyte count (x 103 /&# 956;L) and diarrhea (scores) were evaluated. After the death, the jejunum and the ileum were collected for determination of myeloperoxidase (MPO), IL- 1 &# 946; and IL- 10 (pg / ml) and histopathological analysis. ANOVA / Kruskal Wallis test or Bonferroni / Dunn were used as statistical tests. P < 0. 05 was accepted. CEPA 84 / 2014 protocol. Post-septic animal by CLP treated with Irinotecan decreased scores of diarrhea and MPO activity in the 5 th and 7 th day (diarrhea 5 D: [0 (0 - 0) ]; 7 D: [0 (0 - 2) / MPO jejunum and ileum 5 D: 2. 96 Â 1. 08, 2. 35 Â 0. 76 and 7 D: 0. 42 Â 0. 14, 0. 92 Â 0. 19, respectively) compared against the SHAM animals treated with Irinotecan (diarrhea 5 D: [1 (0 - 1) ]; 7 D: [2. 5 (1 - 3) ] / MPO jejunum and ileum 5 D: 8. 15 Â 1. 48, 7. 96 Â 0. 96; 7 D: 2. 51 Â 0. 67, 2. 87 Â 0. 65, respectively). Furthermore, post-septic mice treated with Irinotecan decreased histopathological damage in the 5 th and 7 th day (5 D jejunum and ileum: [1 (1 - 3) ] and [1 (0 - 1) ], and 7 D in the ileum: [2 (1 - 3) ] for Irinotecan (jejunum and ileum 5 D: [4 (2 - 4) ] and [4 (1 - 4) ] / 7 D: ileum [4 (3 - 4) ]) and increased levels of IL- 10 (jejunum and ileum 5 D: 55. 80 Â 3. 42; 34. 45 Â 1. 87; 7 D: Ileum: 133. 00 Â 20. 25) compared against the SHAM + IRI (5 D in jejunum and ileum: 34. 45 Â 1. 87; 6. 91 Â 3. 05; 7 D ileum:. 63. 67 Â 9. 08). However, IRI + CLP animals had no change of IRI-induced leukopenia. C 57 BL/ 6 post-septic animals had reduced intestinal mucosal injury and neutrophil infiltration in IM induced by Irinotecan, this effect can be consequential, among others, of the increase in IL- 10...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a simple method that uses skulls {{to estimate the}} diameter, and hence the mass, of birds' eyes. Allometric analysis demonstrated that, within five orders (parrots, pigeons, petrels, raptors and owls) and across 104 families of flying birds, eye mass is proportional to (<b>body</b> <b>mass)</b> 0. 68 over a range of <b>body</b> <b>masses</b> (6 <b>g</b> to 11. 3 kg). As expected from their habits and visual ecology, raptors and owls have enlarged eyes, with masses 1. 4 and 2. 2 times greater than average birds of the same weight. Taking existing relationships for flight speed on <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> we find that resolution increases close to (flight speed) 1. 333. Consequently, large birds resolve objects at a longer time to contact than small birds. Eye radius and skull size co-vary in strict proportion, suggesting common physiological, aerodynamic and mechanical constraints. Because eye mass scales close to brain mass, metabolic rate and information processing could also be limiting, but the precise factors determining the scaling of eye to body have not been identified...|$|R
