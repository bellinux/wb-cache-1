5|$|Birds have {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric times, {{when they were}} represented in early cave paintings. Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> commissioned for books.|$|E
5|$|More than 330 {{species of}} <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded}} in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region {{in the winter and}} autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> recorded over the Hawar islands.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
50|$|There is {{consensus}} among paleontologists that <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{the descendants of}} coelurosaurs. Under modern cladistic definitions, <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> considered the only living lineage of coelurosaurs. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora.|$|R
50|$|Toxic <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> <b>birds</b> {{that use}} toxins to defend {{themselves}} from predators. No species of <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> known to actively inject or even produce venom, but some <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> known to be poisonous to touch or eat. These birds usually sequester poisons from animals and plants that they feed on, commonly from poisonous insects.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{with land}} creatures and fish, the Torah doesn't give signs for {{determining}} kosher birds; instead {{it gives a}} list of unkosher birds, The Talmud also offers signs for determining whether a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> kosher or not. If a bird kills other animals to get its food, eats meat, or <b>is</b> a dangerous <b>bird,</b> then <b>is</b> not kosher, a predatory <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> unfit to eat, raptors like the eagles, hawks, owls and other hunting <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> not kosher, vultures and other carrion-eating <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> not kosher either. Crows {{and members of the}} crow family such as jackdaws, magpies and ravens are not kosher. The storks, kingfishers, penguins and other fish-eating <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> not kosher.|$|R
5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> {{among the}} wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
5|$|Ruffs were {{formerly}} trapped {{for food}} in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at Archbishop Neville's enthronement banquet in 1465. The <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> netted while lekking, sometimes being fattened with bread, milk and seed in holding pens before {{preparation for the}} table.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.|$|E
50|$|The {{drinking}} <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{dating back}} to 1910s~1930s.The drinking <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> patented in the US in 1945 and 1946 by two different inventors.|$|R
500|$|The <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} {{granivorous}} (grain eating) and carnivorous groups, which are explained in some detail. The speed, senses, flight, migration, pairing behaviour and feeding of <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> then discussed, with observations from Spallanzani and Gilbert White, whose Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne {{was published in}} 1789. The pleasure of watching <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> mentioned: ...|$|R
5000|$|Flightless <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> <b>birds</b> {{that through}} {{evolution}} {{lost the ability}} to fly. There are over 60 extant species including the well known ratites (ostrich, emu, cassowary, rhea and kiwi) and penguins. The smallest flightless <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> the Inaccessible Island rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless <b>bird,</b> which <b>is</b> also the largest living <b>bird,</b> <b>is</b> the ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg). Ostriches are farmed for their decorative feathers, meat and their skins, which are used to make leather.|$|R
5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> brought to the site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens nesting near {{sources of}} human garbage {{included}} {{a higher percentage}} of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> also eaten.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry {{was aware that}} native <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} of Apsat with fish and <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> thought {{to stem from}} the eagle, which, as a fishing <b>bird,</b> <b>is</b> associated with both {{the sky and the}} water.|$|R
50|$|In all cases, a <b>bird's</b> diet <b>is</b> {{carefully}} measured {{to control}} its weight. Weight determines how hungry the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> and how lazy it will act. A <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> overweight {{will be more}} likely to fly away or not hunt. A <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> somewhat underweight will act aggressively, and a <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> severely underweight will have health problems.|$|R
5|$|Native American {{folklore}} {{held that}} the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> the last to seek shelter before a hurricane, {{and the first to}} emerge afterwards. The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> thus a symbol for danger and optimism.|$|R
5|$|In mythology, <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{sometimes}} monsters, {{like the}} Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|Other researchers, like Larry Martin {{believe that}} dromaeosaurids, {{along with all}} maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all. Martin {{asserted}} for decades that <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, and now he agrees that the two are the closest of relatives. Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds, and that birds evolved from non–dinosaurian archosaurs, so {{that most of the}} species formerly called theropods would now not even be classified as dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Bold and inquisitive, this <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> readily approachable by humans. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} observed {{using a small}} chip of bark held in {{its beak}} {{as a tool to}} dig for insects.|$|R
50|$|Native American {{folklore}} {{held that}} the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> the last to seek shelter before a hurricane, {{and the first to}} emerge afterwards. The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> thus a symbol for danger and optimism.|$|R
40|$|Cloacal-vent {{prolapse}} in a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> often fatal if left untreated. A 10 -month-old female love <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to}} teaching veterinary hospital, Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Bangladesh, {{due to an}} everted cloaca through the vent. This condition was treated successfully by washing, massage, and icing. Calcium was supplemented orally for five days and the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> cured completely after seven days...|$|R
5|$|The <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> hunted by {{settlers}} on Réunion, {{who also}} kept them as cagebirds. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling {{was reported to}} be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between subspecies are small, making subspecific boundaries hard to define, and the exact distribution of S. a. heineken is unclear, since birds from northwest Africa {{may be of}} this form. About 2% of male blackcaps on Madeira and the Azores are melanistic, with black plumage on the whole head and upper breast. Melanistic females are rarer, and are characterised by grey-brown underparts. This dark morph has also been recorded from the Canary Islands, but not from Cape Verde. The melanistic <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> formerly sometimes {{considered to be a}} distinct subspecies, S. a. obscura.|$|E
5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E
50|$|The fabulous {{qualities of}} the oozlum <b>bird</b> <b>are</b> {{the subject of a}} poem by W. T. Goodge (1862-1909). In the poem The Oozlum <b>Bird,</b> the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to fly {{backwards}} and has the singular ability of being able to fly up in the air while letting the earth turn under it. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to be large enough to bear the weight of a man.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Bird</b> <b>is</b> Gone: A Manifesto is {{a murder}} mystery by Stephen Graham Jones. It was {{published}} in 2005 by Fiction Collective 2. The <b>Bird</b> <b>is</b> Gone: A Manifest is Jones' third novel.|$|R
50|$|This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} the scaly {{appearance}} of its breast and back feathers. Along with its scaly markings, the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> easily identified by its white crest that resembles a tuft of cotton.|$|R
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{population in}} towns near the Everglades hunted in the area. Raccoons and otters {{were the most}} widely hunted for their skins. Hunting often went unchecked; in one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250alligators and 172otters. Water <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> a particular target of plume hunting. Bird feathers were used in women's hats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The melampittas are a family, Melampittidae, of New Guinean birds {{containing}} two enigmatic species. The {{two species}} {{are found in}} two genera, the greater melampitta in the genus Megalampitta and the lesser melampitta in the genus Melampitta. They are little studied and before being established as a family in 2014 their taxonomic relationships with other <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> uncertain, being considered at one time related variously to the pittas, Old World babblers and birds-of-paradise.|$|E
5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bird</b> life <b>is</b> rich, {{especially}} during the migration seasons. Ducks, geese and wading <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> especially abundant.|$|R
50|$|In February 2012, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again {{voted in}} by the fans for the Indigenous All Stars team to play the NRL All Stars in the annual All Stars match. In April 2012, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again {{selected}} for the Country Origin team in the annual City vs Country Origin match. In 2012, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again selected for New South Wales in all 3 games of the 2012 State of Origin series.|$|R
50|$|Some of Whitaker's {{collection}} of Tunisian <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in the Natural History Museum, London. The Sicilian <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{divided between the}} Royal Scottish Museum (bird skins) and the Ulster Museum (bird mounts, eggs and nests).|$|R
