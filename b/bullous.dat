5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called <b>bullous</b> emphysema.|$|E

25|$|In January 2013, Flaherty {{announced}} he had <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid. He {{was treated with}} prednisone, a corticosteroid with powerful known side effects.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can result}} in symptoms similar to the blistering form include other <b>bullous</b> skin diseases, burns, and necrotizing fasciitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bullous</b> Pemphigoid, Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Drug Eruptions. Epidermolysis Bullosa, Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita, Erythema Multiforme, Lichen Planus, {{pemphigus}} vulgaris, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Cheyletiella blakei {{infection}} {{has been}} associated with sleeping with a cat. It is manifested by <b>bullous</b> and vesicles that are intensly itchy. The bacterium is present on the cat's skin.|$|E
25|$|This field {{specializes in}} the {{treatment}} of immune-mediated skin diseases such as lupus, <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and other immune-mediated skin disorders. Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs.|$|E
25|$|Impetigo is {{primarily}} caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and sometimes by Streptococcus pyogenes. Both <b>bullous</b> and nonbullous are primarily caused by S. aureus, with Streptococcus also commonly {{being involved in}} the nonbullous form.|$|E
25|$|Some of the viral infections {{mentioned}} above are also classified as vesiculobullous diseases. Other example vesiculobullous diseases include pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease, and epidermolysis bullosa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bullous</b> impetigo, mainly seen in {{children}} younger than 2 years, involves painless, fluid-filled blisters, mostly on the arms, legs, and trunk, surrounded by red and itchy (but not sore) skin. The blisters may be large or small. After they break, they form yellow scabs.|$|E
25|$|Impetigo is {{more likely}} to infect {{children}} ages 2–5, especially those that attend school or day care. 70% of cases are the nonbullous form and 30% were the <b>bullous</b> form. Other factors can increase the risk of contracting impetigo such as diabetes mellitus, dermatitis, immunodeficiency disorders, and other irritable skin disorders. Impetigo occurs more frequently among people who live in warm climates.|$|E
25|$|Pemphigus is an {{uncommon}} autoimmune skin disease. The {{most common form}} in dogs is pemphigus foliaceus, which manifests as erosions and crusting of the skin and mucocutaneous junctions. Pemphigus vulgaris is more rare and manifests as blister-like lesions in the mouth and at mucocutaneous junctions. <b>Bullous</b> pemphigoid is most commonly seen in Dobermanns and Collies and appears as a scald-like lesion of the groin.|$|E
25|$|Soft lenses {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal. They {{are used in the}} treatment of conditions including <b>bullous</b> keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2014, Flaherty {{announced}} that he was resigning as Minister of Finance in order to return to the private sector. While he had openly discussed health challenges associated with managing <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid, including taking prescription steroids, he said the decision was reached after many months of consultation with his family and that his health was not a factor in his decision. Flaherty continued sitting in the House of Commons as an MP until his death three weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitic phase occurs a {{few days}} later and {{typically}} lasts for several weeks. This phase is heralded by bilateral panuveitis causing blurring of vision. In 70% of VKH, the onset of visual blurring is bilaterally contemporaneous; if initially unilateral, the other eye is involved within several days. The process can include bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis, variable degree of vitritis, thickening of the posterior choroid with elevation of the peripapillary retinal choroidal layer, optic nerve hyperemia and papillitis, and multiple exudative <b>bullous</b> serous retinal detachments.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} tumor causes circulating and tissue-bound {{antibodies to}} direct themselves against antigens in the plakin family, which {{are involved in}} the intracellular attachment structures in various levels of the skin/respiratory tract/membranes (keeping skin tissue together throughout the body). The number of target antigens varies on a case by case basis. The variability is likely what accounts for the different presentations of PNP. Through immunoprecipitation, target antigens have been found to include desmoglein-3, desmoglein-1, envoplakin, periplakin, desmoplakin 1, desmoplakin 2, and <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid antigen I.|$|E

500|$|Bruegel {{painted with}} the {{empirical}} objectivity of the Renaissance. [...] In earlier paintings the blind were typically depicted with eyes closed. Here, Bruegel gives each man a different ocular affliction, all painted with a realism that allowed identification of their conditions by later experts, {{though there is}} still some diagnostic disagreement. [...] French anatomical pathologist Jean-Martin Charcot and anatomical artist Paul Richer published an early account, [...] ("The deformed and sick in art", 1889), and French pathologist Tony-Michel Torrillhon followed with more research on Bruegel's figures in 1957. [...] The first man's eyes are not visible; the second has had his eyes removed, along with the eyelids: the third suffers from corneal leukoma; the fourth atrophy of the globe; the fifth is either blind with no light perception, or photophobic; and the sixth has pemphigus or <b>bullous</b> pemphigoid. [...] Charcot and Richer noted Bruegel's accuracy in portraying the blind men facing not forward but with their faces raised in the air, as {{they would have had to}} rely on their senses of smell and hearing.|$|E
