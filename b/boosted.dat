50|$|Scattered {{across the}} tracks are {{blue and red}} <b>boost</b> icons. When touched these icons allow the player who touched them to <b>boost.</b> Red <b>boost</b> icons are more scarce than blue <b>boost</b> icons {{due to the fact}} red <b>boost</b> icons give more <b>boost</b> fuel. When a player has <b>boost</b> fuel they may use the <b>boost</b> button to <b>boost,</b> which allows a player's boat to reach speeds much higher than what would {{normally}} be possible. Also by <b>boosting</b> a player can knock other boats into the air, a feature described by the game as the Mighty Hull. Another aspect of <b>boosting</b> is the Hydro Jump which is performed by braking and using the <b>boost</b> button.

40|$|<b>Boosting</b> {{has been}} shown to improve the {{performance}} of classifiers in many situations, including when data is im-balanced. There are, however, two possible implementa-tions of <b>boosting,</b> and it is unclear which should be used. <b>Boosting</b> by reweighting is typically used, but can only be applied to base learners which are designed to handle ex-ample weights. On the other hand, <b>boosting</b> by resampling can be applied to any base learner. In this work, we empir-ically evaluate the differences between these two <b>boosting</b> implementations using imbalanced training data. Using 10 <b>boosting</b> algorithms, 4 learners and 15 datasets, we find that <b>boosting</b> by resampling performs as well as, or signif-icantly better than, <b>boosting</b> by reweighting (which is of-ten the default <b>boosting</b> implementation). We therefore con-clude that in general, <b>boosting</b> by resampling is preferred over <b>boosting</b> by weighting. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Boosting</b> {{combines}} {{a set of}} moderately accurate weak classifiers to form a highly accurate predictor. Compared with binary <b>boosting</b> classification, multi-class <b>boosting</b> received less attention. We propose a novel multi-class <b>boosting</b> formulation here. Unlike most previous multi-class <b>boosting</b> algorithms which decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple independent binary <b>boosting</b> problems, we formulate a direct optimization method for training multi-class <b>boosting.</b> Moreover, by explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the formulated primal optimization problem, we design totally-corrective <b>boosting</b> using the column generation technique in convex optimization. At each iteration, all weak classifiers’ weights are updated. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our direct multi-class <b>boosting</b> achieves competitive test accuracy compared with state-of-the-art multi-class <b>boosting</b> in the literature.

5000|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is the way}} in which <b>boost</b> control is achieved, {{depending}} on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] <b>boost</b> controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators.

5000|$|A ball & {{spring type}} <b>boost</b> {{controller}} uses {{the force of}} a spring acting against the <b>boost</b> pressure to control <b>boost.</b> This is installed with one <b>boost</b> signal line coming from the intake somewhere after the turbocharger, and one <b>boost</b> signal line going to the wastegate.

The tighter the spring, the more <b>boost</b> that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the <b>boost</b> pressure to reach the wastegate actuator. There is a bleed hole on the <b>boost</b> controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air that would be trapped between the wastegate actuator and the ball after it is seated again.
