The most basic processes were forward (direct) and backward (indirect) microextrusion. The ram (which propels the billet forward) and billet both move {{in the same direction}} with forward microextrusion, while in backward microextrusion has the ram and billet moving in opposite directions. These in turn have been applied to specialized applications such as the manufacture of microbillet, brass micropins, microgear shafts, and microcondensers. However, other processes have been applied to microextrusion, including forward rod-backward cup extrusion and double cup (one forward, one <b>backward)</b> <b>extrusion.</b>|$|E

40|$|Metal forming, {{especially}} cold forming, is an economical way of production, {{that saves}} natural ressources as well. Compared to other manufacturing technologies, {{the amount of}} raw materials, the number of manufacturing steps, thus the total energy consumption {{in order to produce}} the workpiece, can be reduced. Due to the high contact pressures that exist between workpiece and tool during forming, the tribological loads on the tools are high. In order to reach an economical tool life, tool wear has to be reduced. In order to reach this goal, a pretreatment of the workpieces and highly additived lubricants are used in cold forming. This leads to emissions that reduce the ecological compatibility of these processes. Nowadays, due to political boundary conditions, even in an international context, environmental and economical aspects are increasingly linked together. Besides the necessity for sustainable production that should by now seem to be self evident, a real economic pressure for ecologically compatible production arises. This work intends to show, how this goal can be reached with regards to the lubrication conditions in cold forming. Cold forming processes in this work are bulk forming (<b>backward</b> cup <b>extrusion)</b> and fine blanking. In <b>backward</b> cup <b>extrusion,</b> high contact pressures arise. In fine blanking, high contact pressures occur in combination with a very high surface enlargement. The tribological conditions in all the other cold forming processes lie between these extremes or impose lower demands onto the tribological system. Therefore, these two forming operations serve very well as a basis for the development of environmentally compatible tribological systems. The solution that helps to reduce the lubrication effort in the above mentioned processes lies in the application of hard coatings on the tools. In order to do so, however, it is necessary to analyse the tribological conditions that exist in the forming operations. Knowing these conditions, lots of aspects regarding the use of hard coatings will be considered and optimised...|$|R

GDC structure was a dendrite α-Pb phase, while the equiaxed structure was observed via NRC, with remaining β-SbSn phase as a cubic shape.

Microstructuring by forming is a challenging task concerning material flow, tool and process design [2]. In this study, a hybrid forming process combined of micro impact extrusion and shear displacement is presented and discussed. The formed microstructure consists of ten parallel primary cavities with cross sections of 0. 30 ́ 20. 3 mm 2 and four larger secondarycavities which are surrounding the primary cavities.

Micro <b>backward</b> impact <b>extrusion</b> is chosen for structuring the primary cavities since it allows accurate forming without aligning die plate and stamp due to a flat die plate. Shear displacement forming, which is the selected process for the secondary cavities, requires a structured and aligned die plate but the forming forces are significantly lower than forming the same geometry with an extrusion process, which in turn increases the accuracy.

This report serves to examine the forming loads, metal flow and extrusion defects arising during the <b>backward</b> <b>extrusion</b> of aluminium cups. The report surveys the literature of extrusion with particular interest in <b>backward</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Extrusion was carried out {{with the aid of a}} specially constructed 50 mm <b>backward</b> <b>extrusion</b> tool designed and manufactured by the author. Five extrusion ratios were examined, using both the direct and indirect extrusion directions and flat, conical and nosed punch ends were used to examine metal flow and forming loads for various punch profiles. Forming loads were found to be much greater for direct extrusion and the usual relationship was derived for load/extrusion ratio characteristics. The effects of friction and lubrication were examined and these effects on load and flow patterns were noted. Incremental forming of split billets with grids scribed on the mid-plane was carried out for a variety of punch profiles. This revealed the evidence of a dead metal region forming and arc below the end of flat punches. The geometry of dead metal regions was compared with that derived by an upper bound technique and found to agree well. Also, upper bound loads using this model were derived and found to compare favourably. Forming using conical punch profiles showed that the adoption of a smooth profile similar in geometry to the dead metal zone reduced extrusion leads significantly. Extrusion defects were examined and found to fall into three categories, namely cavitation, internal cracking and shearing of the corner. Cavitation was found to occur when the base thickness becomes smaller than the wall thickness, which was also proved theoretically. Also cracking was found to occur only at large extrusion ratios during direct extrusion. Finally, in the light of conclusions drawn from the work, recommendations were made as to suggestions for further work which could usefully continue the present work...|$|E
