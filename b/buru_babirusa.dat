25|$|About a {{third of}} the {{population}} is indigenous, mostly Buru, but also Lisela, Ambelau and Kayeli people. The rest of population are immigrants from Java and nearby Maluku Islands. Religious affiliation is evenly split between Christianity and Sunni Islam, with some remnants of traditional beliefs. While local languages and dialects are spoken within individual communities, the national Indonesian language is used among the communities and by the administration. Most of the island is covered with forests rich in tropical flora and fauna. From the present 179 bird and 25 mammal species, about 14 are found either on Buru only or also on a few nearby islands, the most notable being the wild pig <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa.</b> There is little industry on the island, and most population is engaged in growing rice, maize, sweet potato, beans, coconuts, cocoa, coffee, clove and nutmeg. Other significant activities are animal farming and fishing.|$|E
25|$|As Buru {{is located}} at the {{boundary}} between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> (Babyrousa babyrussa) is distinguished from the other Babyrousa species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very low fat content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour. Also endemic to Buru are three types of bats: Moluccan flying fox (Pteropus chrysoproctus), Ceram fruit bat Pteropus ocularis and lesser tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene minutus).|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{local people}} {{traditionally}} occupied villages, variation of their seasonal activities – predominantly hunting and farming – tended to either disperse or gather them. Men hunted the wild pig <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa,</b> deer and possum, in the forests, mostly {{during the peak}} of east monsoon (June and July); meanwhile women were gathering wild vegetables. However, during the west monsoon (November to April) {{both men and women}} were working together in the fields. The position of the villages was also changing with time, mostly because of the low soil fertility on the island – recovery of the soil took significant time urging long-distance travel to the new fields. It was rather common for a family to leave the village for most of the week to their field and return only for the religious service on Sunday. It was also rather common to move the entire village after some 20 years of exploiting a plot of land. Partly because of this, most settlements were rather small, with the smallest type accommodating one-two families (hum-hawa or hum-tapa), middle-type (hum-lolin) consisting of 3–10 houses and accommodating 20–50 people, and larger ones of 30–50 houses and 150–300 people (fen-lale). On the coast, there were several multi-ethnic settlements with more than 200 houses (ibu kota kecamatan). This local variety of terms for a [...] "settlement" [...] puzzled the Dutch colonizers trying to systematise the local registries.|$|E

50|$|The {{restricted}} {{habitat of}} the <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa,</b> {{with the total}} area within 20,000 km², and its gradual loss due to logging persuaded the International Union for Conservation of Nature to declare the species as vulnerable. Hunting by the local population is another cause of concern. Whereas it is unpopular among Muslim communities for religious reasons, it is widely hunted by the indigenous people of Buru, which are predominantly Christian. The meat of <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> has low fat (only 1.27% compared to 5-15% for domestic pigs) and {{is regarded as a}} delicacy. It is also preferred by the locals to the meat of other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavor. The establishment of two protected areas on Buru, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km²) and Waeapo (50 km²), partly aim at preserving the habitat of the <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa.</b> This species also enjoys full protection under Indonesian law since 1931.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Buru</b> <b>{{babirusa}}</b> (Babyrousa babyrussa), {{also known}} as the Moluccan babirusa, golden babirusa or hairy babirusa, is a wild pig-like animal native to the island of Buru and the two Sula Islands of Mangole and Taliabu, all belonging to Indonesia. Traditionally, this relatively small species included the other babirusas as subspecies, but it has been recommended treating them as separate species based on differences in their morphology. As also suggested by its alternative common names, the <b>Buru</b> <b>Babirusa</b> has relatively long thick, gold-brown body-hair - a feature not shared by the other extant babirusas.|$|E
5000|$|In females, the canines are far {{shorter and}} {{typically}} do not protrude. In comparison, the <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> has relatively long, thick body hair, a well-developed tail-tuft, and relatively short and slender upper canines in males, while the Togian babirusa is larger, has a relatively well-developed tail-tuft, {{and the upper}} canines of the male are [...] "short, slender, rotated forwards, and always converge".|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} the genus were {{considered}} part of a single species until recently, the babirusa or pig-deer, B. babyrussa, but following the split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> from Buru and the Sula Islands, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named B. celebensis. The split, which uses the phylogenetic species concept, is based on differences in size, amount of hair on body and tail-tuft, and measurements of the skull and teeth.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{dominates the}} local economy. Cultivation of rice - {{the most common}} crop of the region - is {{hindered}} on Ambelau by the hilly terrain and abundance of the wild pig <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> damaging the crops (which is rarely hunted because of the Muslim traditions). The small terrains of fertile land on the coast are used to grow maize, sago sweet potato, cocoa, coconut, allspice and nutmeg. Tuna fishing is practiced by the villages of Masawoy and Ulimo. Some agricultural and fish products are exported to the nearby Buru islands, mainly on the markets of the town Namlea.|$|E
50|$|Most Lisela {{people are}} engaged in farming rice, maize, sago, sweet potato and various spice, such as allspice, nutmeg and Eucalyptus tree used for {{aromatic}} oil. In the inland areas, they also hunt the wild pig <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa,</b> deer and possum, and take part in tuna fishing on the coast. In the urban areas, {{the growing number of}} Lisela people take jobs in the industrial enterprises. Traditional Buru houses are made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs are covered with palm leaves or reeds, with tiles becoming progressively popular. National Buru costume is similar that of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket.|$|E
5000|$|The babirusas, {{also called}} babushkas or deer-pigs (babirusa) are a genus, Babyrousa, in the pig family (Suidae) found in Wallacea, or {{specifically}} the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru. All {{members of this}} genus were considered part of a single species until 2002, the babirusa, B. babyrussa, but following the split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named B. celebensis. The remarkable [...] "prehistoric" [...] appearance of these mammals {{is largely due to}} the prominent upwards incurving canine tusks of the males, which actually pierce the flesh in the snout. If a babirusa does not grind its tusks (achievable through regular activity), they can eventually keep growing so as to penetrate the animal's own skull.|$|E

5000|$|Most Ambelau {{people are}} engaged in farming. The mountainous terrain of Ambelau island hinders {{cultivation}} of rice, which is the major crop of the region, and therefore maize, sago, sweet potato, cocoa, coco, allspice and nutmeg are grown instead in the coastal areas. Some residents of Ambelau work at the sago plantation on Buru. [...] Hunting the wild pig <b>Buru</b> <b>babirusa</b> is common, but tuna fishing is mostly localized to the villages of Massawa and Ulima. Traditional Buru houses are made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs are covered with palm leaves or reeds, with tiles becoming progressively popular. National Buru costume is similar that of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. The specificity of Ambelau clothing is the preference of red color in holiday attire, which also includes hats of peculiar shape - a peaked cap with a plume for men and dressing with panache for women.|$|E

Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. However, the colors and decor items differ quite substantially among Masarete, Wae Sama and Rana. Traditional Buru weapons are straight machete (parang) and a short spear. In the past, Buru hunters were famed for their spear throwing skills. Buru people, along with the Muslim or Christian names, also use traditional ones, the most common being Lesnussa, Latbual, Nurlatu, Lehalima, Wael and Sigmarlatu.|$|E
