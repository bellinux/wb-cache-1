25|$|Thomas Cole is {{regarded}} as the founder of the Hudson River School, an American art movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from Romanticism. This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825 and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating the unique natural beauty found in the United States. The wild, untamed nature found in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, <b>but</b> <b>America</b> had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend William Cullen Bryant sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended The Voyage of Life to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape as an allegory for religious faith.|$|E

2500|$|After {{three years}} of winning their first title, [...] "La Mecha" [...] was heading towards their second one. It was a cold and grey morning that day in Bogotá, where the team faced Millonarios. With noise and an old bus, América de Cali arrived to the stadium Nemesio Camacho (El Campín). Caleños that {{lived in the city}} came to support the team as well as many fans {{arriving}} from Cali. Millonarios came out with their full attack, <b>but</b> <b>América</b> de Cali played with tranquility and soon enough the first goal came As they kept a close watch on the other games being played that day, América de Cali withstood the constant attack of Millonarios. Time took an important role and as it ran down, it only benefited América de Cali. Deportes Tolima had won their match, Deportivo Pereira were tying their match, and Nacional had scored their second goal. Everything was going their way and the only thing left to do was win the game against Millonarios. The final minutes were very tense, but once the referee blew the whistle, the fans were able to chant once more, [...] "América Campeon".|$|E

Despite receiving a [...] "golden ticket," [...] a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as [...] "ghetto", explaining: [...] "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK <b>but</b> <b>America</b> {{is a very different}} market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess?

2500|$|Reforma, a Mexican newspaper, {{said that}} Grillo used the [...] "closest {{information}} possible to his object of work", {{which means that}} he ran through serious [...] "threats" [...] to get his work done. Due to Grillo's experience and professionalism, Reforma argues that El Narco is both [...] "horrifying and useful". The San Antonio Express-News claims that the book [...] "delivers the first authoritative and comprehensive examination" [...] of the mafia killings in Mexico. The newspaper explains that Grillo's book can help readers [...] "understand the homicidal madness just across the river". It concluded by comparing the book with a [...] "big canvas" [...] that traces {{the rise of the}} Mexican drug trafficking organizations from the quaint 19th-century origins. The New Yorker wrote a review for El Narco and noted that the reading was [...] "terrific—full of vivid front-line reporting; diverse interviews; a sense of history; a touch of social science; clarifying statistics; and realistic reviews of what might be done to improve things, none of it easy". The magazine said it is an [...] "essential reading". It argued that it is America's [...] "weak control of automatic weapons" [...] and its [...] "supply [...] guns and money" [...] that fuel the bloodshed in Mexico. The Globe Corner Bookstore said that El Narco [...] "draws the first definitive portrait of Mexico's drug cartels and how they have radically transformed in the last decade". In addition, it mentioned that [...] "the devastation may be south of the Rio Grande, <b>but</b> <b>America</b> is knee-deep in this conflict." [...] The Independent noted that Grillo and his book have [...] "achieved extraordinary access to gangsters and police (often the same people)". And, the author shows how the Mexican drug cartels originated in the western state of Sinaloa, where the conditions for growing opium poppy were ideal, in the late 19th century. The New York-based magazine known as the Bookforum said that several books have been written in Spanish about Mexico's drug war, but Grillos book is perhaps the [...] "first attempt in English for a popular audience". The magazine noted that Grillo has spent years traveling to Mexico's drug war hotspots: [...] "Sinaloa, Michoacán, Ciudad Juárez—recording interviews with cops and narcos, visiting grave sites and murder scenes". Bookforum concludes that Grillo's book was an attempt to dig more and beyond the [...] "reigning mythology of the Mexican drug war".|$|E
