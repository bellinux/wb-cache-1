In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|Although Christine had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> {{passed through the}} Leeward Islands, heavy rains from the storm, peaking at , caused flooding in Puerto Rico. Over 600 homes were flooded and dozens of families had to be evacuated from several towns. One person died from electrocution after stepping on a downed wire on a flooded street. Minor damage was recorded in the Virgin Islands, mainly downed power lines which left roughly 500 people without telephone service.|$|E

Although an eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery, the storms had displayed very deep convection, thus the NHC initially maintained the intensity at 120mph (195km/h). Virgil's eye continued to become less defined, and was downgraded to Category 2 intensity {{at the time of}} landfall on October 4.

5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E

The hurricane quickly strengthened, and attained its peak intensity on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, nearing the Texas Gulf Coast, the storm waned in intensity, and was only a Category 1 hurricane <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> made a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas, on August 30.
