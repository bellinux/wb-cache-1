5|$|After {{the defeat}} of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to {{negotiate}} a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic <b>blunder</b> when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting {{the importance of the}} capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a <b>blunder</b> that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a <b>blunder</b> from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E

The FA decreed {{she had not}} been properly registered and Arsenal were deducted three points.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, many Israelis demanded an {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the <b>blunder),</b> with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick Lazio {{to replace}} him.

5|$|According to Nolutshungu, the 1984 {{bilateral}} Franco-Libyan agreement {{may have}} provided Gaddafi with {{an excellent opportunity}} to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habré into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's <b>blunder</b> would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|ITV has {{produced}} two other shows, TV Nightmares, and TV's Naughtiest <b>Blunders.</b> Both were presented by Steve Penk, before {{the latter was}} changed to show continuous clips with voice-over by Neil Morrissey. Nightmares presented TV personalities relating some of their most hair-raising moments, and Naughtiest <b>Blunders</b> presented more risqué mistakes. The latter has also been criticised for {{being used as a}} simple schedule filler, often with ridiculously titled editions (e.g. [...] "All New TV's Naughtiest <b>Blunders</b> 18").|$|R
40|$|Foragers {{unable to}} leave a patch at the optimal moment must act as {{constrained}} foragers. Extending the results of Houston and McNamara (1985), we compare a <b>blundering</b> forager that leaves patches at a constant rate with an unconstrained optimal forager that leaves patches at the optimal time. When a dimensionless measure of environmental quality exceeds a particular value, the <b>blundering</b> forager remains in patches longer on average than the unconstrained optimal forager. The relative success of the <b>blundering</b> forager is, paradoxically, lowest when its average departure time exactly matches that of the unconstrained optimal forager. When foraging in two dimensions, <b>blundering</b> provides a robust spatial foraging strategy for dealing with unknown diVerences in patch size...|$|R

Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial decision. He made a <b>blunder</b> in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick going straight to Jermaine Beckford who scored.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played in March–April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker <b>blunder</b> with Black in an equal ending.

In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a {{position}} with an isolated queen pawn but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.|$|E

5|$|The protests {{reached a}} new level of {{visibility}} during 1993 as part of a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal of a tree on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage of the protest was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security <b>blunder,</b> became occupied by squatters.|$|E
5|$|This was {{to prove}} a {{tactical}} <b>blunder,</b> as the new Libyan intervention had alarmed France. Habré issued a fresh plea for French military assistance on 6 August. France, also due to American and African pressures, announced on 6 August the return of French troops in Chad as part of Operation Manta, meant to stop the GUNT-Libyan advance and more generally weaken Gaddafi's influence {{in the internal affairs}} of Chad. Three days later several hundred French troops were dispatched to N'Djamena from the Central African Republic, later brought to 2,700, with several squadrons of Jaguar fighter-bombers. This made it the largest expeditionary force ever assembled by the French in Africa outside of the Algerian War.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps {{divisions}} of Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a <b>blunder</b> by Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly {{north of town}} and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a salient in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.|$|E

40|$|The pilot-machine {{interface}} with cockpit automation {{is a critical}} factor in achieving the benefits of automation and reducing pilot <b>blunders.</b> To improve this interface, an automatic terminal approach system (ATAS) was conceived that can automatically fly a published instrument approach by using stored instrument approach data to automatically tune airplane radios and control an airplane autopilot and autothrottle. The emphasis in the ATAS concept is a reduction in pilot <b>blunders</b> and work load by improving the pilot-automation interface. A research prototype of an ATAS was developed and installed in the Langley General Aviation Simulator. A piloted simulation study of the ATAS concept showed fewer pilot <b>blunders,</b> but no significant change in work load, when compared with a baseline heading-select autopilot mode. With the baseline autopilot, pilot <b>blunders</b> tended to involve loss of navigational situational awareness or instrument misinterpretation. With the ATAS, pilot <b>blunders</b> tended to involve a lack of awareness of the current ATAS mode state or deficiencies in the pilots' mental model of how the system operated. The ATAS display provided adequate approach status data to maintain situational awareness...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} phase of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency of attacks. German bombers also raided targets as far north as Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was not even an operational station. This sort of intelligence <b>blunder</b> contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E

To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his <b>blunder,</b> claiming that he'd done to Pete what everyone in the office had wanted to do for some time.|$|E

Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E

Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E
5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his <b>blunder</b> on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing something right.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{resigned}} from the Legislative Council on 16 July 1898, in order to contest the lower house seat of Young against the sitting Labour member, Chris Watson. He focused his campaign on Federation issues but was surprised to be easily defeated by 1,244 votes to 876. Financial difficulties necessitated his focus on legal work rather than campaigning during the second Constitution referendum in 1899, although he still managed to speak most nights. Following the success of Federation, O'Connor {{was to be a}} member of the first Commonwealth ministry, and was instrumental in the affair that became known as the Hopetoun <b>Blunder.</b> Lord Hopetoun, Australia's first Governor-General, had commissioned Sir William Lyne to form a government, since Lyne was Premier of the largest state, New South Wales. O'Connor was one of those who refused to serve under Lyne, who had been lukewarm on the issue during the Federation campaigns, and was significant in the negotiations that led to Lyne's resignation of the commission in Barton's favour. On 1 January 1901, O'Connor was appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, an honorary post, in Barton's Cabinet.|$|E
