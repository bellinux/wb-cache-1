40|$|Recently, {{producing}} and maintaining short bunches in accelerators {{has become a}} forefront issue. Examples of accelerators that require short bunches are high quality nuclear physics accelerators, free electron laser driver accelerators, next generation linear colliders, and linac-based fourth generation light sources. Large bodies of work have accumulated at various sites on producing, measuring, and maintaining ultrashort bunches. In this paper such work is reviewed, with particular emphasis placed on diagnostic techniques that may be applied in the subpicosecond rms bunch duration domain. Instrumentation based on both time domain and frequency domain methods are discussed: in the frequency domain, coherent radiation detection techniques in the far infrared receive special emphasis. In addition to the usual problem of measuring the bunch longitudinal distribution function, {{it is also important}} to have efficient ways to control the bunch length in short <b>bunch</b> <b>machines.</b> Solving this problem involves instruments with somewhat different properties than the standard ones. Consequently, some space is devoted to several devices, both in use and proposed, that are useful in the problem of controlling ultrashort bunches...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in short electron bunches for different applications such as short wavelength FELs, linear colliders, and advanced accelerators such as laser or plasma wakefield accelerators. One would like to meet various requirements such as high peak current, low momentum spread, high luminosity, small ratio of bunch length to plasma wavelength, and accurate timing. Meanwhile, recent development and advances in RF photoinjectors and various bunching schemes {{make it possible to}} generate very short electron bunches. Measuring the longitudinal profile and monitoring bunch length are critical to understand the bunching process and longitudinal beam dynamics, and to commission and operate such short <b>bunch</b> <b>machines.</b> In this paper, several commonly used measurement techniques for subpicosecond bunches and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed. As examples, bunch length related measurements at Jefferson lab are presented. At Jefferson Lab, bunch lengths s short as 84 fs have been systematically measured using a zero-phasing technique. A highly sensitive Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) detector has been developed to noninvasively monitor bunch length for low charge bunches. Phase transfer function measurements provide a means of correcting RF phase drifts and reproducing RF phases to within a couple of tenths of a degree. The measurement results are in excellent agreement with simulations. A comprehensive bunch length control scheme is presented...|$|R

40|$|Fast kicker magnets {{are used}} to inject beam into and eject beam out of the CERN SPS {{accelerator}} ring. These kickers are generally ferrite loaded transmission line type magnets with a rectangular shaped aperture through which the beam passes. Unless special precautions are taken the impedance of the ferrite yoke can provoke significant beam induced heating, over several hours, even above the Curie temperature of the ferrite. At present the nominal bunch spacing in the SPS is 25 ns, however for {{an early stage of}} LHC operation it is preferable to have 50 ns <b>bunch</b> spacing. <b>Machine</b> Development (MD) studies have been carried out with an inter-bunch spacing of 25 ns, 50 ns or 75 ns. For some of the SPS kicker magnets the 75 ns bunch spacing resulted in considerable beam induced heating.

Remarkably, a Landau damping of the EM wavepacket is predicted and put forward for a future investigation.

To circumvent this problem strong feedback systems are necessary to damp collective instabilities. The principle requirements for these damper systems will be reviewed and the performance of existing systems will be presented. Although single bunch instabilities are not considered a problem for particle factories there is still an interest to combat single bunch instabilities, for example the transverse mode coupling instability.

40|$|The Proton Synchrotron {{accelerator}} (PS), {{installed at}} CERN, although commissioned in 1959, still plays {{a central role}} in the production of beams for the Antiproton Decelerator, Super Proton Synchrotron, various experimental areas and for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The PS produces beams of different types of particles, mainly protons, but also various species of ions. Almost all these particle beams pass through the PS. The quality of the beams delivered to the LHC has a direct impact on the effective luminosity, and therefore the performance of the instrumentation of the PS is of great importance. The old trajec- tory and orbit measurement system of the PS dated back to 1988 and no longer fulfilled present day requirements. It used 40 beam position monitors (BPMs) and an analogue signal processing chain to acquire the trajectory of one single particle bunch out of many, over two consecutive turns at a maximum rate of once every 5 ms. The BPMs were in good condition, however the electronics was aging and increasingly difficult to maintain. The new system digitizes the BPM signals using 125 MS/s, 12 bit ADCs. The digitized sample stream are processed on the fly into individual bunch positions, using numerical algorithms implemented on fast programmable logic (FPGA). The system stores the positions of all <b>bunches</b> in the <b>machine</b> over the full duration of an acceleration cycle, requiring large memories. Post processing can be applied to the data in order to extract orbits (averaged positions over many turns), mean radial position, phase space images or machine tune data. Client orbit display programs running on operator consoles can then concurrently request measurements from any interesting part of the cycle. The ADCs digitize their input signals at a constant rate, whereas the revolution frequency of the particle bunches varies along the acceleration cycle. The increase of this frequency depends on the increase of particle velocity, and varies over more than an octave for heavy ions. The system is able to keep track of each individual bunch from injection all through to ejection using tracking and synchronization algorithm. In essence, its task is to decide which of the ADC samples belong to each particle bunch. The new system uses an entirely numerical synchronization algorithm, implemented in the FPGA and running at the ADC sampling rate.
