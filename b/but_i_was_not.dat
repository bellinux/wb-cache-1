Of his time in Korea, Dean later said, [...] "I wouldn't have awarded myself a wooden star for what I did as a commander." [...] In his autobiography, he opted instead to highlight the command decisions he regretted making and contend, [...] "There were heroes in Korea, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> one of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1933 {{after she}} became First Lady, a rose was {{discovered}} and named after Eleanor, {{with the name}} Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt (Rosa x hybrida “Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt”). It is a hybrid tea rose. However, though this is true, {{there is no evidence}} to support the story that Eleanor later quipped, [...] "I once had a rose named after me and I was very flattered. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> pleased to read the description in the catalogue: no good in a bed, but fine up against a wall".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about his}} childhood, Khan {{said that he}} was exposed to a [...] "life beyond movies", and his mother {{described}} him as someone who was [...] "not an easy child [...] He was impulsive [...] spontaneous." [...] As a child, he recalls fond memories of watching his father playing cricket in the garden, and has emphasised his father's education and background as having a lasting impression on how family life was conducted. Khan studied at The Lawrence School, Sanawar in Himachal Pradesh and was later sent to Lockers Park School in Hertfordshire at the age of nine. He next enrolled at Winchester College and explained that [...] "I did not take advantage of my tenure [...] My classmates went on to Oxford and Cambridge, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> academically inclined. When I applied myself, which was not often, I stood first. I should have studied harder." ...|$|E

500|$|Between 1740 and 1746, he was {{introduced}} to Harriot Pratt, {{and he began to}} write poetry about her. By 1749, {{he was in love with}} her and wrote to his friend Charles Burney (father of Fanny Burney), [...] "I am situated within a mile of my Harriote & Love has robd Friendship of her just dues... There was a great musical crash at Cambridge, which was greatly admired, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> there, being much better pleased with hearing my Harriote on her spinnet & organ at her ancient mansion", suggesting that he was living permanently in Market Downham, London. Although he wrote many poems dedicated to Harriot, his poem [...] "The Lass with the Golden Locks" [...] (1752) claims that he was done with both Harriot, Polly, and other women. The [...] "lass with the golden locks" [...] who replaced Smart's previous fancies was Anna Maria Carnan. Anna would be Smart's future wife and she was the stepdaughter of John Newbery, Smart's future publisher.|$|E
500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

Somewhere in the past, I believe I answered in the affirmative once for strange and complicated reasons. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a member of any organized religion." ...|$|R

2500|$|Also in 1947, Hayworth was {{featured}} in a Life cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed [...] "The Love Goddess". The term was adopted and used later {{as the title of}} a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, [...] "Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completely exposed." ...|$|E
2500|$|A longer {{exploration}} of his faith {{can be found}} in an interview with Third Way Magazine.

There was an Australian priest at the same college as me who got me interested again. In a sense, it was a rediscovery of religion as something living, that was about the world around me rather than some sort of special one-to-one relationship with a remote Being on high. Suddenly I began to see its social relevance. I began {{to make sense of the}} world".|$|E

2500|$|When Chandler came to {{work with}} Wilder he was already a {{recovering}} alcoholic. As Wilder noted, [...] "He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and I {{think he had a}} tough time with me – I drove him back into drinking..." [...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, to mention that the studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, [...] "to explain Chandler to himself." ...|$|E
