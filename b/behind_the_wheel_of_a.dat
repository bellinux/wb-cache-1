I love driving, I love pushing the limit {{and all the rest of}} it but racing for me... I don't have an ambition to do it and I think that's an important part of the equation." ...|$|E
500|$|Benson {{followed}} Gardner's {{pattern of}} setting Bond {{in the contemporary}} timeframe of the 1990s and, according to Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner, he also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more. James Harker noted that [...] "whilst Fleming's Bond had been an Express reader; Benson's is positively red top. He's the first to have group sex... {{and the first to}} visit a prostitute", whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner. In a 1998 interview Benson described his version of Bond as a more ruthless and darker character, stating that [...] "Bond is not a nice guy. Bond is a killer... He is an anti-hero." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996, American author Raymond Benson {{became the}} writer of the Bond novels. Benson had {{previously}} written The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984, and had also written scenarios and support material for the early 1980s 007 James Bond dice-and-paper role playing game. By the time {{he moved on to}} other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories. Benson followed Gardner's pattern of setting Bond in the contemporary timeframe of the 1990s and, according to academic Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner. Benson also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more, which led Black to note that there was an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner. However, commenting in The Australian, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent, noted that Benson [...] "has got the Fleming feel... It's as close to Fleming as I have seen." [...] The Peterborough Evening Telegraph agreed, stating that with Benson's 007, in keeping more with Fleming, [...] "PC-ness goes out the window and it's a more ruthless Bond with bad habits." [...] The Sunday Mercury in 1999 said, [...] "Benson has made Bond less gimmicky, concentrating on the action rather than the gadgets. The result is a slick enough read for dedicated Bond fans who like blazing guns (Walthers, of course) and beautiful women" [...] and Kirkus Reviews called Benson's 007 [...] "a chip off the old block and, if not a gilt-edged Bond, at least a double-A." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1960 he had six non-finishes {{in seven}} races <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> factory-{{prepared}} BRM. At the Dutch Grand Prix, at Zandvoort, a brake system failure on the poorly prepared BRM caused {{the most serious}} accident of his career, breaking his arm, killing a young spectator and instilling in him a longstanding distrust of engineers. The accident also caused {{him to make a}} change in his driving style that later paid dividends: his tendency to use his brakes more sparingly than his rivals meant that they lasted longer, especially in endurance races. Gurney was known to give the brake pedal a reassuring tap just before hard application — a habit Gurney himself jokingly referred to as [...] "the chicken-shit school of braking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boon and Watt split songwriting fairly evenly (and Hurley {{made many}} {{contributions}} as well), though Watt rarely sang and Hurley even less so. Boon's songs were typically more direct and progressively political in nature, while Watt's were often abstract, self-referential [...] "spiels." [...] Lyrics and themes would thus often veer from surreal humor, as in [...] "Bob Dylan Wrote Propaganda Songs" [...] and [...] "One Reporter's Opinion", to {{the frustrations of}} blue collar life in California, as in the enduring [...] "This Ain't No Picnic". While many contemporaries rarely displayed a sense of humor, Minutemen were generally more light-hearted and whimsical. One example {{of this can be}} found in the title of their album Double Nickels on the Dime, which poked fun at Sammy Hagar's [...] "I Can't Drive 55" [...] by implying that the Minutemen preferred to take risks with their music rather than <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{less than six}} months after Gibson's 2006 DUI incident, where the director made antisemitic comments to police after being stopped on suspicion of drunk driving; the incident garnered Gibson much negative publicity and magnified concerns some had over alleged antisemitism in his previous film, The Passion of the Christ. [...] Several key film critics alluded to the incident in their reviews of Apocalypto: In his positive review, The New York Times A. O. Scott commented: [...] "say what you will about him – about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews – he is a serious filmmaker." [...] The Boston Globe review came to a similar conclusion, noting that [...] "Gibson may be a lunatic, but he's our lunatic, and while I wouldn't wish him <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car after happy hour or at a B'nai Brith function anytime, behind a camera is another matter." [...] In a negative review, Salon.com noted [...] "People are curious about this movie because {{of what might be called}} extra-textual reasons, because its director is an erratic and charismatic Hollywood figure who would have totally marginalized himself by now if he didn't possess a crude gift for crafting violent pop entertainment." ...|$|E
