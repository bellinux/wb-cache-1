2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the <b>bottom</b> <b>shelf.</b> As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E

40|$|During a triinstitutional {{study to}} test whether {{individually}} ventilated caging systems impaired welfare and reproduction relative to static housing systems, varying numbers (2 to 7) of discoid-shaped, fleshy structures were found in utero of 17 postpartum female mice on study. Further investigation revealed these structures to be retained fetal membranes (RFM). A point prevalence of 24. 3 % was calculated based on a total population of 70 postpartum female mice on study. This finding was preceded by 3 typical clinical presentations, which are described here. We designed a case-control matched cross-sectional epidemiologic study to identify associated risk factors and antemortem indicators of RFM. Housing on the <b>bottom</b> <b>shelves</b> and attachment to the rack systems were factors associated with a diagnosis of the condition.

40|$|Rack solar drier is {{one example}} of useful {{utilization}} of solar energy, but has not widely used by the public, yet. Using this solar drier we can dry our fish and agricultural products without fossil fuels. Solar dryer works by absorbing sunlight by four blackened flat collectors, and the heat generated by the collectors was transferred by air flow to the plenum chamber and drying chamber consisting of shelves. The solar dryer used in this experiment has dimension of 4, 66 m length by 4, 66 m width and by 1, 95 m height. The dryer has a capacity of around 50 kg materials that can be dried during 20 hours. Based on our testing it was observed that the decrease in water level was not uniform among the shelves position. The final moisture content was highest in the top shelves, followed by middle <b>shelves</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>shelves.</b> The average final moisture content was 16, 95 %. The time required for drying was 20 hours, with an average moisture load of 10, 46 kg H 2 O. The average drying rate was 0, 5228 kg H 2 O/jam or 2, 10 % wet basis per hour. In this experiment intensity of solar radiation was measured to be 634, 88 Watt/m 2, and electric power of 12, 83 Watt was used to run small fan in order to exhaust moist air. The average energy used (Qe) for drying banana chips was 37124, 58 kJ per each drying process and the average energy input used during the drying process (Qrs) was 147. 227, 87 kJ. This meant that average drying efficiency was 27, 07 %. Technically, it can be concluded that solar dryer can be used as an alternative to drying agricultural commodities...|$|R
40|$|Steady state creep of {{a hybrid}} metal-composite {{laminated}} bending beams of irregular patterns is considered. Beams consist of walls and load-bearing layers, attached {{at the top}} and <b>bottom</b> (<b>shelves).</b> The shelves are reinforced with fibers in the longitudinal direction, and the walls are reinforced either longitudinally or cross in the plane. Under the hypotheses of the Timoshenko theory the boundary value problem is formulated for the calculation of the considered beams, which allows taking into account the weakened resistance of the walls of the transverse shifts. The simple iteration method based on the idea of the secant modulus method is applied for linearization of the problem. The mechanical behavior of reinforced and unreinforced double seat beams and cantilevers in conditions of steady creep under the action of uniformly distributed transverse load is investigated. Cross sections of beams are I-shaped. It is shown that for homogeneous I-beams, the classical Bernoulli theory does not guarantee the calculated results in compliance within 20 % accuracy, which is considered to be acceptable if the width of the shelf is comparable with the height of cross sections of beams. In the cases of metal-composite beams, the classical theory becomes generally unacceptable, because it lowers by several orders of magnitude the compliance of such structures in conditions of steady creep. It is demonstrated that the rate of shear strain, actively developing in their walls, must be considered. The consideration of these strain rates {{within the framework of the}} Timoshenko theory led to the discovery of new mechanisms of deformation of laminated beams which the classical theory does not find. It is shown that the change in mechanism of deformation can occur by increasing the density of reinforcement of shelves or walls...|$|R
