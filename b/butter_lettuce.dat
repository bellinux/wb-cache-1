5000|$|A famous {{scene from}} the film {{takes place in a}} {{roadside}} restaurant where Bobby tries to get a waitress (Lorna Thayer) to bring him a side order of toast with his breakfast. The waitress refuses, stating that toast is not offered as a side item, despite the diner's offering a chicken salad sandwich on toast. Bobby appeals to both logic and common sense, but the waitress adamantly refuses to break with the restaurant's policy of only giving customers what is printed in the menu. Ultimately, Bobby orders both his breakfast and the chicken salad sandwich on toast, telling the waitress to bring the sandwich to him without mayonnaise, <b>butter,</b> <b>lettuce,</b> or chicken, culminating in Bobby's responding to the waitress' incredulity at his order to [...] "hold the chicken" [...] with [...] "hold it between your knees!" [...] The waitress then indignantly orders them to leave, and Nicholson knocks the glasses of water off the table with a sweep of his arm.|$|E
50|$|Lettuce is {{a primary}} ingredient, and several types of lettuce can be used, such as <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce,</b> cos lettuce, Boston lettuce, romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce and iceberg lettuce, among others. The lettuce may be chopped, torn, {{shredded}} or sliced into ribbons. Additional ingredients may include, {{but are not limited}} to, chicken stock, beef stock, cream, milk, wine, lemon juice, egg or egg yolk, meats, rice, potato, greens, sorrel, watercress, Swiss chard, escarole, peas, parsley/dried parsley, bread crumbs, onion, shallot, garlic, salt and pepper, among others. Some preparations purée all of the ingredients together, and some preparations are strained in a sieve. Lettuce soup is sometimes served with toast or rolls, either as a side dish or with the soup poured upon it. Sometimes croutons or chopped bacon are used in the dish or to garnish it. In French cuisine, lettuce soup is usually served poured atop thin slices of lightly toasted French bread. Some versions are served cold. Total calories can vary depending on ingredients used. For example, versions that use milk may have fewer calories than those that use cream.|$|E

This study is posed in Agriculture field of University of Muhammadiyah Malang on ± 550 m above sea levels during November 2013 until March 2014. It uses random factorial group sampling. Factorial I lettuce varieties (V) consists of <b>butter</b> headed <b>lettuce</b> (V 1), red leaf lettuce (V 2), and green leaf lettuce (V 3). Factorial II, the concentrate of fermicompost fertilizer (K) consists of 0 ml/l water; 10 ml/l water; 20 ml/l water; 30 ml/l water. The treatment was repeated three times by using 3 samples hence is used 108 plants. The first phase is planting and conserving by monitoring temperature and pH parameter of worms. The second phase is analyzing nutrient content of Lumbricus Rubellus fertilizer which consists of macro element (Nitrogen (N), Phosphor (P), Calium (K), micro Ferrite (Fe), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), C-organic), C/N ratio of vermi compost fertilizer. The third phase is implementing vermi compost fertilizer toward lettuces, included: plant height (cm), leaves number, leaf width (cm 2), fresh weight (g), and dry weight (g).

40|$|Much {{focus has}} been placed on the impact of {{exposure}} to perchlorate (ClO 4 -) from drinking water. Recently, it has become more apparent that a significant percentage of the total ClO 4 - exposure may be due to ingestion of food. Most studies have only evaluated the uptake and distribution of ClO 4 - by plants without considering the potential for uptake of iodine (I) by the plant and the subsequent impacts on ClO 4 - uptake and distribution on human health. The objectives of this research effort were to evaluate the relative uptake of ClO 4 - and I supplied as either Kl or KlO(3), the two major environmental forms of I in a standard hydroponic nutrient solution using <b>butter</b> head <b>lettuce.</b> No interaction of ClO 4 - uptake and distribution was found in the presence of I- or IO 3 - relative to previous studies evaluating ClO 4 - alone. Bioconcentration factors for ClO 4 - and total I in <b>butter</b> head <b>lettuce</b> when coexposed to both anions were similar for outer (292 +/- 17 and 294 +/- 12 L kg(- 1) of dry weight, respectively) and inner (76 +/- 18 and 60 +/- 8 L kg(- 1) of dry weight, respectively) leaves but not for roots (23 +/- 3. 7 and 359 +/- 1. 7 L kg(- 1) of dry weight, respectively) when the iodine was supplied as I-. The uptake of iodine was lower (BCF = 47 +/- 3. 8, 19 +/- 0. 6, and 189 +/- 16, L kg(- 1) of dry weight for the outer and inner leaves and roots, respectively) for all tissues when iodine was supplied as IO 3 -, with the greatest accumulation by the roots. These results suggest that if lettuce is grown using fertilizers containing both ClO 4 - and I-, then the final ratio of I-T/ClO 4 in the leaves will be essentially equal to the ratio in the fertilizer but lower if the I is supplied as IO 3 -. Therefore, the impact of the consumption of lettuce containing ClO 4 - may be mitigated if the lettuce is grown using fertilizer with an appropriate amount of I to maintain the existing ratio of serum I to total goitrogen load (TGL). Nevertheless, the TGL in lettuce appeared to be almost completely dominated by NO 3 - with only a minor contribution of ClO 4 -, even for the highest exposure to ClO 4 -...|$|R

40|$|Fresh-cut <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> inoculated with Listeria innocua was stored under {{controlled}} atmospheres (CA) containing 5 kPa O 2 and 0 kPa CO 2, 5 kPa O 2 and 15 kPa CO 2, 75 kPa O 2 and 0 kPa CO 2, 75 kPa O 2 and 15 kPa CO 2, and 21 kPa O 2 and 0 kPa CO 2 (as control) for 10 days at 7 °C. The {{growth of}} L. innocua, aerobic mesophilic bacteria, {{lactic acid bacteria}} and yeasts was studied. Additionally, the respiration rates and visual appearance of the <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> were monitored in all treatments. The browning was measured on the lettuce stems using L*, chroma and hue values. High CO 2 conditions promoted the growth of L. innocua. No O 2 effect {{was found on the}} growth of L. innocua. However, when high O 2 and CO 2 conditions were combined, a reduction in the aerobic mesophilic bacterial count was observed. A high O 2 condition alone could reduce the mesophilic count to the same extent as low O 2 levels combined with high CO 2 levels while avoiding anaerobic fermentation reactions. The studied CA conditions slightly affected the respiration rates of fresh-cut <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce.</b> CO 2 treatments decreased the browning of the lettuce stems. Colour changes were also slightly delayed on the stems under high O 2 levels.

40|$|Studies {{to examine}} lettuce aphid {{population}} growth on resistant head and <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivars {{were conducted in}} small filed plots at the Yuma Agricultural Center.

Results of five field trials showed that several varieties of head and <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> have been developed that almost completely prevent lettuce aphids from surviving and reproducing on plants during the spring. Although the cultivars tested did not posses marketable characteristic for harvests, they do provide germplasm for breeding new varieties suited for desert production.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} O- 2 levels from 0 to 100 kPa {{in combination with}} 0, 10 and 20 kPa CO 2 on the respiration metabolism of greenhouse grown fresh-cut <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> was studied. Controlled atmospheres of 20 or 75 kPa O- 2 with 0 or 10 kPa CO 2 showed a constant respiration rate during the first 2 - 4 days at different temperatures (1, 5 and 9 degrees C). Therefore, constant respiration rates during {{a short period of}} 2 - 4 days could be considered as valid for {{a large part of the}} commercial life of, for instance, a modified atmosphere package development. The fresh-cut lettuce exposed to low O- 2 levels (2 - 10 kPa) combined with moderate to high CO 2 levels (10 and 20 kPa) had a higher respiration rate than when 20 - 100 kPa O- 2 were used. Moderate CO 2 levels (10 kPa) reduced the respiration rates of fresh-cut lettuce 20 - 40 % at 9 degrees C. This effect was less noticed at lower temperatures. Gas composition with high CO 2 levels (20 kPa) probably caused a metabolic disorder increasing the respiration rate of fresh-cut <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce.</b> It was concluded that 80 kPa O- 2 must be used in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to avoid fermentation of fresh-cut <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> in combination with 10 - 20 kPa CO 2 for reducing their respiration rate.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} {{were used to}} obtain a variety of bacterial and fungal species antagonistic to Pythium - F group in hydroponic systems. Isolations were made from roots of ‘escape’ lettuce plants in a commercial hydroponic gravel system as well as Pythium mycelium exposed to the hydroponic solution. Seventy four bacterial and eighteen fungal isolates were obtained and were screened for in vitro activity against Pythium {{by means of the}} dual culture method. Twenty-two bacterial isolates rendered between 10. 8 and 48 % inhibition and ten fungal isolates rendered between 24. 3 and 54 % inhibition of Pythium mycelial growth. Potential biocontrol agents were screened in a static aquaculture system on butterhead lettuce seedlings in the greenhouse prior to evaluation in a re-circulating gravel bed hydroponic system in the greenhouse and field, for both growth promoting and biocontrol ability. Significant increases of between 689 % and 922 % in total fresh yield were obtained from plants preventatively treated with isolates JH 49, JH 41, JH 83, JM 6 R and JM 16 W. The eight best performing isolates were further evaluated for biocontrol activity against Pythium as well as growth promotion on <b>butter</b> head <b>lettuce</b> in a re-circulating gravel bed hydroponic system in the greenhouse. Significant increases of 1. 5 % - 63. 5 % and 0. 9 % - 38. 8 % in total fresh yield were obtained from plants evaluated for growth promotion and Pythium control, respectively. Based on their performance five of the eight isolates were selected for evaluation in a re-circulating gravel bed hydroponic field system. Treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis significantly increased fresh leaf weight of lettuce plants in comparison with the untreated control indicating effective suppression of Pythium. Of the isolates that were previously evaluated against Pythium wilt and root rot of lettuce in a hydroponic system (Chapters 2 and 3), 6 bacteria and 2 fungi were most effective. The following possible modes of action of these isolates, were investigated, namely competition, production of inhibitory substances and induced resistance. The root colonizating ability of the isolates was also assessed. Competition between the isolates and the pathogen were confirmed by testing for siderophore and hydrolytic enzyme production. Five of the isolates produced siderophores much faster than the rest, demonstrating that these isolates were able to take-up iron from the media at a faster rate, thus indicating a significant competitive ability. Antibiotic production by the isolates was confirmed in vitro by means of the dual culture technique. Of the eight isolates screened, only one isolate showed in vitro inhibition of the pathogen. This result was confirmed by a TLC assay, where fluorescent bands were formed by the same isolate, indicating the presence of phenolic compounds. These compounds were separated by HPLC. Analysis of total soluble and cell wall phenolic levels in Pythium infected and non-infected plants treated and untreated with the biocontrol isolates did not render conclusive results. Three of the eight isolates were able to colonize 100 % of the lettuce roots. Dissertation (MSc (Plant Pathology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Greenhouse-grown <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L.) can {{potentially}} be stored for 21 days at constant 0 °C. When storage temperature was increased to 5 °C or 10 °C, shelf life was shortened to 14 or 10 days, respectively, {{in our previous}} observations. Also, commercial shelf life of 7 to 10 days is common, due to postharvest temperature fluctuations. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish neural network (NN) models to predict the remaining shelf life (RSL) under fluctuating postharvest temperatures. A box of 12 - 24 lettuce heads constituted a sample unit. The end of the shelf life of each head was determined when it showed initial signs of decay or yellowing. Air temperatures inside a shipping box were recorded. Daily average temperatures in storage and averaged shelf life of each box were used as inputs, and the RSL was modeled as an output. An R 2 of 0. 57 could be observed when a simple NN structure was employed. Since the "future" (or remaining) storage temperatures were unavailable at the time of making a prediction, a second NN model was introduced to accommodate a range of future temperatures and associated shelf lives. Using such 2 -stage NN models, an R 2 of 0. 61 could be achieved for predicting RSL.

40|$|During postharvest, lettuce {{is usually}} exposed to adverse {{conditions}} (e. g. low relative humidity) that reduce the vegetable quality. In order to evaluate its shelf life, {{a great number}} of quality attributes must be analyzed, which requires careful experimental design, and it is time consuming. In this study, the modified Global Stability Index method was applied to estimate the quality of <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> at low relative humidity during storage discriminating three lettuce zones (internal, middle, and external). The results indicated that the most relevant attributes were: the external zone - relative water content, water content, ascorbic acid, and total mesophilic counts; middle zone - relative water content, water content, total chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid; internal zone - relative water content, bound water, water content, and total mesophilic counts. A mathematical model that takes into account the Global Stability Index and overall visual quality for each lettuce zone was proposed. Moreover, the Weibull distribution was applied to estimate the maximum vegetable storage time which was 5, 4, and 3 days for the internal, middle, and external zone, respectively. When analyzing the effect of storage time for each lettuce zone, all the indices evaluated in the external zone of lettuce presented significant differences (p < 0. 05).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of hydrocooling on the postharvest shelf life of <b>butter</b> <b>lettuce</b> 'Vit&# 243;ria de Santo Ant&# 227;o'. The lettuce heads, after selection, were subjected to the following treatments: T 1 = hydrocooling followed by storage at 5 &# 176;C in the cold chamber; T 2 = storage in the cold chamber at 5 &# 176;C without hydrocooling; T 3 = hydrocooling followed by storage at 22 &# 176;C and T 4 = storage at 22 &# 176;C without hydrocooling. We determined the shelf life, leaves mass loss, chlorophyll content, relative water content, total soluble sugars content, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars and starch. The data were analyzed in split plot in a randomized block design with four replications. The hydrocooling was effective in slowing down the visual wilting of the leaves at 5 and 22 &# 176;C, extending the shelf life. The hydrocooling combined with storage at 5 &# 176;C maintained the leaves water balance, keeping them hydrated during storage, causing an increase of 20 % in the marketing of the product, from 5 days in lettuces without hydrocooling, to 6 days when these were subjected to hydrocooling. No effect of hydrocooling in the chlorophyll content, total soluble sugars, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars and starch of leaves was observed in any of the storage temperatures.
