5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> at one time, {{including}} the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel desk accessory to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> or removed within the Finder; this requires the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. Control panels, however, {{are contained in}} separate files.|$|E
5|$|The street's {{location}} {{in the city and}} its landmark attraction has made it lately a highly prestigious area, with several new luxurious restaurants. However, the descent's sewer and water systems have not been upgraded within the past 100 years, thereby underlining the need for a new system to <b>be</b> <b>installed.</b> Although, city authorities have not yet scheduled a new sewer project system to <b>be</b> <b>installed.</b>|$|E
50|$|In spring 2011, the Club harbour gates <b>were</b> <b>installed</b> in {{response}} to the high water levels.

5|$|After {{the devastating}} raid of 6 July, the Germans held a {{high-level}} {{meeting on the}} site's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site's development. On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> in a single drift. The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, reamed out to a smooth bore with a diameter of , which were to use {{a new type of}} long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of Rheinbote missile launchers were to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E

It was unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore {{noted that the}} update would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, so it can <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> {{in order to receive}} any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|Previously, viewing YouTube {{videos on}} a {{personal}} computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> in the browser. In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard. This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to <b>be</b> <b>installed.</b> The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the MP4 (with H.264 video) or WebM (with VP8 video) formats could play the videos, and not all videos on the site were available.|$|E
5|$|Sinhala {{does not}} come built in with Windows XP, unlike Tamil and Hindi. However, all {{versions}} of Windows Vista and Windows 10 come with Sinhala support by default, and do not require external fonts to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> to read Sinhalese script. Nirmala UI is the default Sinhala font in windows 10.|$|E

5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel.

5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not <b>be</b> <b>installed</b> until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
