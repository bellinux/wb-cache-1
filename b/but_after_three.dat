5|$|Breckinridge studied {{education}} at a classical school operated by Dr. Louis Marshall, {{the brother of}} Chief Justice John Marshall, then followed his brothers, Cabell and John, to Princeton in 1817. His behavior problems continued there; in one year, he spent more than $1200. He was suspended for fighting, and although he was later reinstated, the incident soured him on Princeton, and he was granted an honorable release. (The school later awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1832.) Breckinridge enrolled at Yale University, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>three</b> months, discovered that a one-year residency was required for graduation. Unwilling to complete this requirement, he moved to Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1819.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, Japan {{captured}} the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which {{culminated in the}} Japanese campaign to invade all of China. The Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending China's prior co-operation with Germany. From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, as well as engaging the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou and Communist forces in Pingxingguan. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, <b>but,</b> <b>after</b> <b>three</b> months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not {{hundreds of thousands of}} Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for a cracked rib and a cracked bone in his hand, the first broken bones he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>three</b> consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not offer him a new playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, Georgetown faced Wyoming and won 5143. The Hoyas then beat the Fresno State Bulldogs by eighteen, after leading by five at halftime, to advance to the {{regional}} finals. Georgetown faced off against Oregon State in the regional final. In the game, the Hoyas shot very well from the field, setting the tournament record for field goal percentage in a game, 77.4%, en route to the 69–45 victory. In the national semifinal against Louisville, both teams shot very poorly. The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the first half, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>three</b> minutes into the second half, Georgetown gained the lead and never relinquished it. The Hoyas used defense to maintain their lead and set the pace of the game, which they won 5046.|$|E

5|$|Written by Peter Ling & Hazel Adair, {{this story}} {{developed}} out of plans by producer Nathan-Turner {{to create a}} sequel to the 1960s soap opera Compact, entitled Impact. When, after drafting three or four scripts for the proposed Impact, Nathan-Turner informed the pair that plans for the soap had been cancelled, the producer offered {{them the opportunity to}} write for Doctor Who as a form of compensation. A scene breakdown (whittled down from six parts to four) was commissioned on 12 July 1983, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>three</b> months of development on the scripts, during which the story was restructured into two 45-minute episodes, it was ultimately rejected. The plot involves the disappearance of various people on Earth, which leads the Doctor and Peri to the planet Hexagora where the Doctor becomes romantically involved with Queen Zafia who is trying to save the insect race of Hexagora from destruction through a plan to infiltrate and take over Earth. It was later adapted as Hexagora by Paul Finch for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Moors {{had invaded}} Byzacena and {{defeated}} the local Byzantine garrison, killing its commanders, Gainas and Rufinus. After diplomatic entreaties {{over the winter}} failed, and with his forces bolstered to some 18,000 men (as estimated by Charles Diehl) following the arrival of reinforcements, in spring 535 Solomon led his troops into Byzacena. The Moors, under their chiefs Cutzinas, Esdilasas, Iourphouthes and Mesidinissas had encamped at a location called Mammes. Solomon attacked them there and defeated them. The Byzantine army returned to Carthage, but there news came that the Moors, reinforced, had again attacked and overrun Byzacena. Solomon immediately marched out and met them at Mount Bourgaon, where the Moors had erected a fortified camp and awaited his attack. Solomon divided his forces and sent 1,000 men to attack the Moors from behind, scoring a decisive victory: the Moors broke and scattered, suffering great casualties. Those who survived fled to Numidia, where they joined the forces of Iaudas, {{the leader of the}} tribes of Mount Aurasium. With Byzacena secured, and urged by his own Moorish allies Massonas and Ortaias, Solomon now turned to Numidia. He cautiously advanced to Aurasium and challenged Iaudas to battle, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>three</b> days, distrusting the loyalty of his allies, Solomon returned his army to the plains. He left part of the army to keep watch on the Moors and established a series of fortified posts along the roads linking Byzacena with Numidia. Solomon then spent the winter preparing a new expedition against Aurasium and also against the Moors of Sardinia, but his designs were interrupted by a major army mutiny in spring 536.|$|E
