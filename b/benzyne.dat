For example, the FT-ICR technique allows the investigation of reactive intermediates that are difficult to study in condensed phase. A class of reactive intermediates that are of great interest due to the antitumor properties of some members are the <b>benzynes</b> and their analogues. The goal of this work was to expand the body of knowledge pertaining to m-benzynes and their analogues. The reactivity of a negatively charged m-benzyne analogue, 3, 5 -didehydrobenzoate, was found to be controlled by its polarity, resulting in this m-benzyne reacting as a nucleophile. A systematic examination into the factors that control the reactivity of m-benzynes in general revealed that the reactivity of a m-benzyne can be 2 ̆ 2 tuned 2 ̆ 2 to favor either nonradical addition/elimination reactions or radical-type reactions simply by changing the constitution or position of substituents. The hydroxyl group was found to induce radical-type reactivity in m-benzyne analogues, but only when it is adjacent to one (but not both) of the two dehydrocarbon atoms. A study of a novel σ,σ,π-triradical revealed that the σ,σ-biradical moiety is substantially more reactive than the π-radical moiety, which contributes to reactivity after reactions have quenched the σ-radical sites. Finally, a thermochemical investigation of charged aromatic monoradicals combines computations, proton affinity bracketing, and energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation, to deduce the heats of formation for these species. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and energetics of gas phase reactions between aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds and the groups three and five {{transition metal ions}} have been studied by Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The results have application to arene exchange, arene activation, hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodesulphanation (HDS), and cyclotrimerization in these systems. A photoactivation pathway for arene displacement with simple Lewis bases has been demonstrated. It is possible to distinguish both associative and dissociative mechanisms. For example, V(C₆H₆) ₂⁺ reacts by a dissociative mechanism, undergoing initial photodissociation to form V(C₆H₆) ⁺ which slowly attaches CH₃CN to form V(C₆H₆) (CH₃CN) ⁺. CH₃CN does not displace benzene from V(C₆H₆) ⁺ at thermal energies. However, upon photoexcitation at 604 nm, [V(C₆H₆) ⁺]* undergoes associative ligand displacement to generate V(CH₃CN) ⁺. The associative reaction occurs on a single minimum potential surface with an endothermic barrier. Tantalum cation activates benzene ring cleavage at thermal energies. The other group three and group five metals studied (with the exception of vanadium) form metal coordinated <b>benzynes</b> by dehydrogenation. A ring cleavage pathway becomes accessible for these metals if pyridine is introduced as an alternate substrate. The primary cleavage products are, in all cases, metallacyclopentadienes. Evidence suggests the cleavage mechanisms for benzene and the heterocycles differ.

The gas-phase enthalpy of formation of 2, 3 -, 2, 4 -, and 3, 4 -pyridyne were determined using a thermochemical cycle and by measuring the proton affinity and chloride bond dissociation energy of deprotonated 2 - and 3 -chloropyridine. These results agree well with theoretical calculations and are compared to <b>benzynes</b> and their aromatic precursors (pyridine and benzene). It was found that polarizing effects stabilize 2, 4 -pyridyne compared to m-benzyne and destabilize 2, 3 -pyridyne compared to o-benzyne. ^ Using ion-molecule reactions and measured rate constants, the electronic structure of a series of phenylnitrenes (triplet diradical, Ph-N) with anionic substituents as well as deprotonated benzaldehyde imines (singlet, PhCHN) with neutral substituents were characterized. Introducing strong anionic pi-donors (CH 2 - and O-) to phenylnitrene stabilizes the closed-shell singlet by more than 30 kcal/mol, such that it becomes the ground electronic state (or degenerate with the triplet) which then resembles a deprotonated imine. Conversely, addition of a strong pi-withdrawing group (-NO 2) to deprotonated benzaldehyde imine induces the opposite effect, stabilizing the triplet, nitrene-like state, {{to the point where it}} is the ground state. These complementary approaches show that the nitrene/imine character is based upon the spin-state of the ion and can be 2 ̆ 2 tuned 2 ̆ 2 by using appropriate substitution of strong pi-donating/withdrawing groups.

The heats of formation of α- and β-naphthyl radicals, chloro-substituted <b>benzynes,</b> and the three benzene triradicals were determined using thermochemical cycles. Their homolytic C-H bond dissociation energies were derived in order to describe their electronic structure. ^ The heat of formation of the (σ,σ,σ) triradical 1, 3, 5 - tris(dehydro) benzene was derived from five independent thermochemical measurements leading from 3, 5 -dichlorobenzoic acid to the triradical. The third C-H bond dissociation energy (BDE) of benzene, i. e. the C-H BDE of m-benzyne at the five position, was determined from the triradical heat of formation. This BDE {{is similar to the}} first and ca. 20 kcal/mol greater than the second, suggesting that the triradical is best described as a lone phenyl radical opposite an m-benzyne moiety. This structure is consistent with a Jahn-Teller distorted C 2 v structure. The three BDEs of benzene were compared with those of cyclopropane, stressing the similarities between 1, 3, 5 -tris(dehydro) benzene and cyclopropenyl radical. ^ The heats of formation 1, 2, 3 - and 1, 2, 4 -tris(dehydro) benzene were derived from dichlorobenzenes via four independent thermochemical measurements in an approach similar to that carried out for the 1, 3, 5 -triradical. The third BDE of benzene to form the 1, 2, 4 -triradical from o-benzene is comparable to that to form the 1, 3, 5 -triradical from m-benzene. This indicates that this triradical is also a lone phenyl radical, which, in this case, is separated from an o-benzene moiety {{on the other side of}} the aromatic ring. The third BDE of benzene to form the 1, 2, 3 -triradical, however, is somewhat lower. This is attributed to a σ “allylic” interaction that stabilizes the singly occupied orbital with respect to the phenyl radical-type singly occupied orbitals in the other two triradicals. ...|$|R
