50|$|DNA microarrays have {{compared}} normal cells {{to breast cancer}} cells and found differences in the expression of hundreds of genes. Although the significance of many of those genetic differences is unknown, independent analyses by different research groups has found that certain groups of genes {{have a tendency to}} co-express. These co-expressing clusters have included hormone receptor-related genes, HER2-related genes, a group of <b>basal-like</b> genes, and proliferation genes. As might therefore be anticipated, there is considerable similarity between the receptor and microarray classifications, but assignment of individual tumors is by no means identical. By way of illustration, some analyses have suggested that approximately 75% of receptor classified triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) <b>basal-like</b> tumors have the expected DNA expression profile, and a similar 75% of tumors with a typical <b>basal-like</b> DNA expression profile are receptor TNBC as well. To say this in a different way to emphasize things, this means that 25% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) <b>basal-like</b> tumors as defined by one or other classification are excluded from the alternative classification's results.

5000|$|Receptor status. Cells have receptors {{on their}} surface {{and in their}} {{cytoplasm}} and nucleus. Chemical messengers such as hormones bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells {{may or may not}} have many different types of receptors, the three most important in the present classification being: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu. Cells with or without these receptors are called ER positive (ER+), ER negative (ER-), PR positive (PR+), PR negative (PR-), HER2 positive (HER2+), and HER2 negative (HER2-).

50|$|Analysis {{of cancer}} {{transcriptome}} databases (www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) showed that TEAD1 is dysregulated in {{several types of}} cancers. First in Kaposi sarcoma there is a 300-fold increase in TEAD1 levels. Moreover, the increase of TEAD expression can be detected in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancers, fallopian tube carcinoma, and germ cell tumors. Otherwise, in other types of cancer TEAD expression is decreased, for example in other breast cancer types and in renal or bladder cancers. This dual role {{can be explained by}} the different targets and the differential regulation of target genes by TEAD transcription factors. Finally recent studies showed that TEAD1 and YAP in ovarian cancer can induces cell stemness and chemoresistance. and that genetic variant of TEAD protein and YAP are enriched in some cancers.|$|E
50|$|Canonical Wnt pathway {{activity}} {{is involved in}} the development of benign and malignant breast tumors. Its presence is revealed by elevated levels of β-catenin in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm, which can be detected with immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Increased β-catenin expression is correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. This accumulation may be due to factors such as mutations in β-catenin, deficiencies in the β-catenin destruction complex, most frequently by mutations in structurally disordered regions of APC, overexpression of Wnt ligands, loss of inhibitors and/or decreased activity of regulatory pathways (such as the Wnt/calcium pathway). Breast tumors can metastasize due to Wnt involvement in EMT. Research looking at metastasis of <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer to the lungs showed that repression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can prevent EMT, which can inhibit metastasis.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Basal-like</b> {{breast cancer}} is {{difficult}} to treat with standard regimen therapy, because it doesn’t express hormone receptors or epidermal growth factor receptors. Identification of oncogenesis pathway is expected to find molecules {{which can be used}} as target for therapy. One candidate molecule is topoisomerase-IIα whose expression is regulated by p 53. This study aimed to compare the expression of mutant p 53 proteins and topoisomerase IIα in <b>basal-like</b> and non <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer, and to determine the association between mutant p 53 proteins and topoisomerase IIα in <b>basal-like</b> group. Methods: The samples were 40 formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues from verified triple negative breast cancer tissue. The samples were divided into 2 groups, <b>basal-like</b> and non <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer, based on cytokeratin - 5 (CK- 5) expression. Mutant p 53 proteins and topoisomerase IIα were stained using immunohistochemistry method, scored and compared. Statistical test used SPSS software version 16 for descriptive statistics, kappa test, normality test, comparison of two mean, and categorical comparison. Results: Median (min-max) of mutant p 53 protein expression in <b>basal-like</b> group was 21 (0 - 100), the non <b>basal-like</b> group was 2 (0 - 80), p = 0. 061.

40|$|<b>Basal-like</b> breast {{carcinoma}} {{is characterized}} by the expression of basal/myoepithelial markers, undifferentiated phenotype, highly aggressive behaviour and frequent triple negative status (ESR−, PR−, Her 2 neu−). We have previously shown that epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs in <b>basal-like</b> breast tumours and identified Lysyl-oxidase-like 2 (LOXL 2) as an EMT player and poor prognosis marker in squamous cell carcinomas.

The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of <b>Basal-like</b> breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of <b>Basal-like</b> breast cancer we performed cocultures of several <b>Basal-like</b> breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these to cocultures of Luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between <b>Basal-like</b> cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including IL- 6, IL- 8, CXCL 1, CXCL 3, and TGFbeta. Under the influence of fibroblasts, <b>Basal-like</b> breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro.

40|$|The {{majority}} of human breast cancers exhibit luminal epithelial differentiation. However, most aggressive behavior, including invasion and purported {{cancer stem cell}} activity, are considered characteristics of <b>basal-like</b> cells. We asked the following questions: Must luminal-like breast cancer cells become <b>basal-like</b> to initiate tumors or to invade? Could luminally differentiated cells within a basally initiated hierarchy also be tumorigenic? To answer these questions, we used rare and mutually exclusive lineage markers to isolate subsets of luminal-like and <b>basal-like</b> cells from human breast tumors. We enriched for populations with or without prominent <b>basal-like</b> traits from individual tumors or single cell cloning from cell lines and recovered cells with a luminal-like phenotype. Tumor cells with <b>basal-like</b> traits mimicked phenotypic and functional behavior associated with stem cells assessed by gene expression, mammosphere formation and lineage markers. Luminal-like cells without <b>basal-like</b> traits, surprisingly, were fully capable of initiating invasive tumors in NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice. In fact, these phenotypically pure luminal-like cells generated larger and more invasive tumors than their <b>basal-like</b> counterparts. The tumorigenicity and invasive potential of the luminal-like cancer cells relied strongly on {{the expression of the}} gene GCNT 1, which encodes a key glycosyltransferase controlling O-glycan branching.

However, the prognosis of <b>basal-like</b> ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is still unknown. Our aim was to study the prognosis of <b>basal-like</b> DCIS in a large population-based cohort. Methods All 458 women with a primary DCIS diagnosed between 1986 and 2004, in Uppland and Västmanland, Sweden were included. TMA blocks were constructed. To classify the DCIS tumors, we used immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (estrogen-, progesterone-, HER 2, cytokeratin 5 / 6 and epidermal growth factor receptor) as a surrogate for the gene expression profiling. The association with prognosis was examined for <b>basal-like</b> DCIS and other subtypes using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results IHC data were complete for 392 women. Thirty-two were <b>basal-like</b> (8. 2 %), 351 were luminal or HER 2 -positive (89. 5 %) and 9 unclassified (2. 3 %). Seventy-six women had a local recurrence of which 34 were invasive. Another 3 women had general metastases as first event. <b>Basal-like</b> DCIS showed a higher risk of local recurrence and invasive recurrence 1. 8 (Confidence interval (CI) 95 %, 0. 8 - 4. 2) and 1. 9 (0. 7 - 5. 1), respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Also, no statistically significant increased risk was seen for triple-negative or high grade DCIS. Conclusions <b>Basal-like</b> DCIS showed about a doubled, however not statistically significant risk for local recurrence and developing invasive cancer compared with the other molecular subtypes.

40|$|<b>Basal-like</b> {{breast cancer}} is a molecularly {{distinct}} subtype of breast cancer that is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. MicroRNA- 29 c (miR- 29 c) {{has been shown to}} be significantly down-regulated in <b>basal-like</b> breast tumors and to be involved in cell invasion and sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, little is known about the genetic and regulatory factors contributing to the altered expression of miR- 29 c in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer. We here report that epigenetic modifications at the miR- 29 c promoter, rather than copy number variation of the gene, may drive the lower expression of miR- 29 c in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer. Bisulfite sequencing of CpG sites in the miR- 29 c promoter region showed higher methylation in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer cell lines compared to luminal subtype cells with a significant inverse correlation between expression and methylation of miR- 29 c. Analysis of primary breast tumors using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset confirmed significantly higher levels of methylation of the promoter in <b>basal-like</b> breast tumors compared to all other subtypes. Furthermore, inhibition of CpG methylation with 5 -aza-CdR increases miR- 29 c expression in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer cells. Flourescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) revealed chromosomal abnormalities at miR- 29 c loci in breast cancer cell lines, but with no correlation between copy number variation and expression of miR- 29 c.

Immunohistochemical markers were used to subtype 1, 424 cases of invasive and in situ breast cancer, and case subtypes were compared to 2, 022 controls. Luminal A, the most common subtype, exhibited risk factors typically reported for breast cancer in previous studies, including inverse associations for increased parity and younger age at first full-term pregnancy. <b>Basal-like</b> cases exhibited several associations that were opposite to those observed for luminal A, including increased risk for parity and younger age at first term full-term pregnancy.

In this study, invasive and in situ breast cancer tissue microarrays containing luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) +/ER− and <b>basal-like</b> breast cancers were analyzed for β-catenin subcellular localization. We demonstrate that nuclear and cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin, a read-out of Wnt pathway activation, was enriched in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancers. In contrast, membrane-associated β-catenin was observed in all breast cancer subtypes, and its expression decreased with tumor progression. Moreover, nuclear and cytosolic localization of β-catenin was associated with other markers of the <b>basal-like</b> phenotype, including nuclear hormone receptor and HER 2 negativity, cytokeratin 5 / 6 and vimentin expression, and stem cell enrichment.

HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is a long intergenic non-coding RNA that epigenetically represses gene expression via recruitment of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH 2), a histone methyltransferase. Elevated expression of HOTAIR promotes progression of breast cancer. In the current study we examined the expression and function of HOTAIR in MCF- 7 -TNR cells, a derivative of the luminal-like breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 that acquired resistance to TNF-α-induced cell death. The expression of HOTAIR, markers of the luminal-like and <b>basal-like</b> subtypes, and growth were compared between MCF- 7 and MCF- 7 -TNR cells.

The metabolite profiles from xenografts were compared with profiles from human breast cancer, sampled from patients with estrogen/progesterone receptor positive (ER+/PgR+) or triple negative (ER-/PgR-/HER 2 -) breast cancer. Results In <b>basal-like</b> xenografts, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) concentrations were higher than phosphocholine (PCho) concentrations, whereas this pattern was reversed in luminal-like xenografts. These differences {{may be explained by}} lower choline kinase (CHKA, CHKB) expression as well as higher PtdCho degradation mediated by higher expression of phospholipase A 2 group 4 A (PLA 2 G 4 A) and phospholipase B 1 (PLB 1) in the <b>basal-like</b> model. The glycine concentration was higher in the <b>basal-like</b> model. Although glycine could be derived from energy metabolism pathways, the gene expression data suggested a metabolic shift from PtdCho synthesis to glycine formation in <b>basal-like</b> xenografts. In agreement with results from the xenograft models, tissue samples from triple negative breast carcinomas had higher GPC/PCho ratio than samples from ER+/PgR+ carcinomas, suggesting that the choline metabolism in the experimental models is representative for luminal-like and <b>basal-like</b> human breast cancer. Conclusions The differences in choline metabolite concentrations corresponded well with differences in gene expression, demonstrating distinct metabolic profiles in the xenograft models representing <b>basal-like</b> and luminal-like breast cancer. The same characteristics of choline metabolite profiles were also observed in patient material from ER+/PgR+ and triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting that the xenografts are relevant model systems for studies of choline metabolism in luminal-like and <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} regulating {{breast cancer}} differentiation state are poorly understood. Of particular interest are molecular regulators controlling the highly aggressive and poorly differentiated traits of <b>basal-like</b> breast carcinomas. Here {{we show that}} the Polycomb factor EZH 2 maintains the differentiation state of <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer cells, and promotes the expression of progenitor-associated and basal-lineage genes. Specifically, EZH 2 regulates the composition of <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer cell populations by promoting a ‘bi-lineage’ differentiation state, in which cells co-express basal- and luminal-lineage markers. We show that human <b>basal-like</b> breast cancers contain a subpopulation of bi-lineage cells, and that EZH 2 -deficient cells give rise to tumors with a decreased proportion of such cells. Bi-lineage cells express genes that are active in normal luminal progenitors, and possess increased colony-formation capacity, consistent with a primitive differentiation state. We found that GATA 3, a driver of luminal differentiation, performs a function opposite to EZH 2, acting to suppress bi-lineage identity and luminal-progenitor gene expression. GATA 3 levels increase upon EZH 2 silencing, mediating a decrease in bi-lineage cell numbers. Our findings reveal a novel role for EZH 2 in controlling <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer differentiation state and intra-tumoral cell composition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR/HER 1) and its downstream signaling events are important for regulating cell growth and behavior in many epithelial tumors types. In breast cancer, the role of EGFR is complex and appears to vary relative to important clinical features including estrogen receptor (ER) status. To investigate EGFR-signaling using a genomics approach, several breast <b>basal-like</b> and luminal epithelial cell lines were examined for sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. An EGFR-associated gene expression signature was identified in the <b>basal-like</b> SUM 102 cell line and was used to classify a diverse set of sporadic breast tumors. Results In vitro, breast <b>basal-like</b> cell lines were more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors compared to luminal cell lines. The <b>basal-like</b> tumor derived lines were also the most sensitive to carboplatin, which acted synergistically with cetuximab. An EGFR-associated signature was developed in vitro, evaluated on 241 primary breast tumors; three distinct clusters of genes were evident in vivo, two of which were predictive of poor patient outcomes. These EGFR-associated poor prognostic signatures were highly expressed in almost all <b>basal-like</b> tumors {{and many of the}} HER 2 +/ER- and Luminal B tumors. Conclusion These results suggest that breast <b>basal-like</b> cell lines are sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and carboplatin, and this combination may also be synergistic. In vivo, the EGFR-signatures were of prognostic value, were associated with tumor subtype, and were uniquely associated with the high expression of distinct EGFR-RAS-MEK pathway genes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Among {{breast cancer}} subtypes, <b>basal-like</b> {{breast cancer is}} {{particularly}} aggressive, and research on the molecules involved in its pathology might contribute to therapy. In this study, we found that expression of NKX 6. 1, a homeobox transcription factor, is higher in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer than in other subtypes. In loss-of-function experiments on <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer cell lines, NKX 6. 1 -depleted cells exhibited reduced cell growth. Because cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is expressed in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer, and increases cell growth, we analyzed expression levels of IL 6, an IL- 6 gene, and observed reduced IL 6 expression in NKX 6. 1 -depleted cells. In a reporter assay, IL 6 promoter activity was reduced by loss of NKX 6. 1 function. A pull-down assay showed that NKX 6. 1 binds to the proximal region in IL 6 promoter. These results indicate that NKX 6. 1 directly up-regulates IL 6 expression. To investigate further, we established cells with forced expression of IL- 6. We observed that exogenous IL- 6 expression restored the reduced cell growth of NKX 6. 1 -depleted cells. Furthermore, orthotopic xenografts showed that NKX 6. 1 -depleted cells lost the capacity for tumor formation. We therefore conclude that NKX 6. 1 is a factor for IL- 6 -regulated growth and tumor formation in <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer. Our findings facilitate profound understanding of <b>basal-like</b> breast cancer, {{and the development of}} suitable therapy...|$|E
