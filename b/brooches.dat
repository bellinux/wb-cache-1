5|$|Commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1858, Garrard & Co. made a set {{of three}} large bow <b>brooches</b> {{containing}} more than 506 diamonds. There is no record of Queen Victoria ever wearing them; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth were seen wearing them frequently. The <b>brooches</b> are often adjusted to contain a large pearl or emerald diamond drop. Queen Mary was pictured {{on more than one}} occasion with the smaller Cullinan diamonds as the drops.|$|E
5|$|The graves {{made by the}} Iazyges {{were often}} {{rectangular}} or circular in shape. They were flat, and were grouped like a modern cemetery. During the time after the Iazyges migrated to the Tisza plain, and were in serious poverty. This {{is reflected in the}} poor furnishings of the burial sites, often filled with clay vessels, beads, and sometimes <b>brooches.</b> Very rarely would there be iron daggers in the burial site, and even more rarely would there be iron swords. Their <b>brooches</b> and arm-rings were of the La Tène type, showing a distinct influence on the Iazyges by the Dacians.|$|E
5|$|Wasps {{have been}} {{modelled}} in jewellery {{since at least}} the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp <b>brooches</b> were made in gold and silver settings. A fashion for wasp waisted female silhouettes with sharply cinched waistlines emphasizing the wearer's hips and bust arose repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.|$|E
50|$|The Harford Farm <b>Brooch</b> is a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon disk <b>brooch.</b> The <b>brooch</b> was {{originally}} made in Kent {{and was found}} along {{with a number of}} other artifacts during an excavation of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Harford Farm in Norfolk. The <b>brooch</b> measures 72mm across and was found in grave 11. The front of the <b>brooch</b> is gold decorated with glass and garnets while the backplate is silver. On the back of the <b>brooch</b> there is a runic inscription which Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service translates as “Luda repaired the brooch” however “may Luda make amends by means of the brooch” has been offered as a translation by Alfred Bammesberger in the journal Neophilologus.In addition to the runes the back of the <b>brooch</b> has a scratched zoomorphic decoration.|$|R

However the <b>brooch</b> is today dated long after this period. The <b>brooch</b> is centred {{on a large}} quartz charmstone, {{and it is not}} implausible that this stone had belonged to the Bruce; the <b>brooch</b> also acted as a reliquary. The <b>brooch</b> is owned by the MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust. It was rarely seen in public until it was loaned to an exhibition in the British Museum in London in 2012.|$|R

5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living <b>brooches</b> by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|New {{settlements}} appearing {{along the}} rivers Mureş, Someş, and Târnava reflects {{a period of}} tranquility in Gepidia until around 568. The common people in Biharia, Cenad, Moreşti, and other villages lived in sunken huts covered with gabled roofs but with no hearths or ovens. They were primarily farmers, but looms, combs, and other products evidence the existence of local workshops. Trading contacts between Gepidia and faraway regions is evidenced by finds of amber beads and <b>brooches</b> manufactured in the Crimea, Mazovia or Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels {{are only}} worn at coronations (StEdward's Crown {{being used to}} crown the monarch) and the annual State Opening of Parliament (the Imperial State Crown). At other formal occasions, such as banquets, the Queen wears the {{jewellery}} in her collection. Elizabeth owns more than 300 items of jewellery, including 98 <b>brooches,</b> 46 necklaces, 37 bracelets, 34 pairs of earrings, 15 rings, 14 watches and 5 pendants, the most notable of which are detailed in this article.|$|E
25|$|The Celtic <b>brooch,</b> more {{properly}} called the penannular <b>brooch,</b> and its closely related type, the pseudo-penannular <b>brooch,</b> are types of <b>brooch</b> clothes fasteners, often rather large.

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Dál Riata {{has been seen}} as a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots {{settlers}} in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements. This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the 7th century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch, found in Ayrshire, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed. In the 8th and 9th centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular <b>brooches</b> with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish pseudo-penannular <b>brooches</b> were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The 8th century Monymusk Reliquary has elements of Pictish and Irish style.|$|E

50|$|The {{design and}} {{manufacture}} of the <b>brooch</b> mixes Celtic and Pictish styles - it may originally {{have been a}} gift from an Irish dignitary to his Scottish counterpart, who later repaired or embellished the <b>brooch</b> according to local tastes. The original provenance of the <b>brooch</b> is unknown, although it is conjectured that the <b>brooch</b> was found in Perthshire in Scotland as it was probably first owned by Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane, whose country estate was located in that county.

5|$|At {{first two}} groups {{established}} themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: One {{on the left}} bank of the Oder River south of Wrocław, {{in the area that}} included Mount Ślęża, and one around the Głubczyce highlands; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400–120 BC period. Burial and other significant Celtic sites in Głubczyce County were investigated in Kietrz and nearby Nowa Cerekiew. The Ślęża group disintegrated eventually within the local population, while the one at Głubczyce Upland apparently migrated out in the southern direction. More recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wrocław County, where in Wojkowice a well-preserved 3rd century BC grave of a woman with bronze and iron bracelets, <b>brooches,</b> rings and chains was found.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as <b>brooches,</b> rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Balch started {{investigating}} the Iron Age cave dwellers in Wookey Hole Caves, {{embarking on a}} four-year study of the caves along {{with other members of}} the Mendip Nature Research Committee. The group mapped the caves, drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting the information in the 1914 book Wookey Hole: its Caves and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as <b>brooches</b> and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>brooch</b> {{has survived}} in {{excellent}} condition, although the pin and its attachments have been removed, {{and the top}} of the <b>brooch</b> has been perforated for suspension, and it may be the only surviving piece of secular Anglo-Saxon metalwork to remain unburied since its creation. It was thought to be a fake by Sir Charles Hercules Read, Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities of the British Museum, because of its excellent condition. He advised the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford which had been lent the <b>brooch,</b> to take it off display. It was then bought by Captain A. W. F. Fuller for the price of the silver. After the discovery of the Strickland <b>Brooch,</b> one of the closest parallels to the Fuller <b>Brooch,</b> also 9th century and in the British Museum, additional research determined that the type of niello used in the Fuller <b>Brooch</b> was used only in the medieval period. In 1952 Capt. Fuller donated the <b>brooch</b> to the British Museum on the condition that it henceforth be called the Fuller <b>Brooch.</b> [...] Stylistically it is [...] "in a very late version of the Trewhiddle style".|$|R

5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic {{objects such as}} <b>brooches,</b> crowns or buckles, in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E
5|$|Shepton Mallet is {{approximately}} {{halfway between the}} Roman towns of Bath and Ilchester on the Fosse Way, and {{although there are no}} visible remains (apart from the line of the Roman road), there is archaeological evidence for early military and later civilian settlement lasting into the 5th century. Domed pottery kilns, with pottery still in situ, were identified {{on the site of the}} Anglo-Bavarian Brewery in the mid-19th century, suggesting military activity in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Several hoards of Roman coins ranging from the 1st to 4th centuries have been found and more than 300 fibula <b>brooches,</b> potsherds and other artefacts. A few isolated burials near the route of the Fosse Way were found during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, archaeological {{techniques}} such as field walking {{have led to the}} discovery of finds ranging in age from prehistoric flints and Bronze Age axe heads to Roman and late medieval finds. Featuring prominently amongst these finds were Roman artefacts including coins, <b>brooches</b> and a snake bracelet. At the invitation of local historian Jim Balme, Time Team excavated in Warburton in September 2006. They were searching for a Roman fortlet that previous archaeological digs by South Trafford Archaeological Group (STAG) indicated might be present. Though no evidence of a Roman fortlet was found, the discovery of strip lynchets indicates that there was a Romano-British farm in Warburton. The presence of Roman finds was explained as rubbish, mixed in with manure to be spread on the crops.|$|E
50|$|Many disc fibulae have gold {{ornamentation}} {{inlaid with}} gemstones, are enamelled or damascened, or are overlaid with gold or silver.

5|$|The Bronze Age– {{defined by}} the use of metal– began around 2500 BC, with {{technology}} changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel; harnessing oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skilful metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as <b>brooches</b> and torcs. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.|$|E
5|$|There were {{considerable}} connections– political, trading, and cultural– {{between the}} Anglo-Saxon kingdoms {{and this is}} demonstrated in the burial ground found at Street House. The practice of burying people in beds {{seems to have been}} very uncommon in the north; most of the bed burials found so far have been in southern England, in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and Wiltshire. Several of the <b>brooches</b> and beads found in the graves are thought to have come from Kent and some of the jewellery and beadwork has strong parallels with finds from East Anglia. The Iron Age gold coins found in one grave came from a tribe that lived in the East Midlands, which suggests that their owner, likewise, was not local.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold <b>brooches,</b> and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E
50|$|The Tara <b>Brooch</b> is a Celtic <b>brooch</b> of the pseudo-penannular type, made in 650 to 750 AD.
