40|$|The {{identification}} of the gene Pp 523, conferring downy mildew resistance to adult plants of broccoli (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> <b>convar.</b> italica), led {{to the construction of}} a genetic map that included this resistance locus, 301 amplified fragment length polymorphisms, 55 random amplified polymorphic DNAs, 46 inter-simple sequence repeats, three simple sequence repeats, four other PCR markers and a flower colour locus, all gathered into nine major linkage groups. Nineteen additional molecular markers were clustered into one group of four markers, one group of three markers and six pairs of markers. The map spans over 731. 9 cM, corresponding to 89. 5 % of the 818 cM estimated to be the total genome length. A significant number of the mapped markers, 19. 3 %, showed distorted segregation. The average distance between mapped adjacent markers is 1. 64 cM, which places this map among the densest published to date for this species. Using bulked segregant analysis, we identified a group of molecular markers flanking and closely linked in coupling to the resistance gene and included these in the map. Two markers linked in coupling, OPK 17 _ 980 and AT. CTA_ 133 / 134, are located at 3. 1 cM and 3. 6 cM, respectively, at each side from the resistance gene. These markers can be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs aiming at the introgression of this gene in susceptible B. oleracea genotypes. The fine mapping of the genomic region surrounding the Pp 523 resistance gene is currently being carried out, a basic condition for its isolation via positional cloning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Modern biotechnologies {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to multiplication the biologic vegetal structures by shaping the morphological phenomena (organogenesis or embryogenesis), which ensure both the maintenance of their characteristic elements {{as well as their}} multiplication in a number of units as extended as possible, starting with a certain type of explant and its intrinsic capacity, according to which, under the influence of in vitro culture, certain cells pertaining to it manifest properties specific to stem vegetal cells. In consequence, the aim of the experimental researches presented in this study was the innovation of in vitro multiplication at Brussels cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> <b>oleracea</b> var. gemmifera), from subvarieties Rosella and Sanda, by direct caulogenesis induced under the influence of explant type (leaf, cotyledon, epicotyl, hypocotyl and radicle) and through direct rhizogenesis induced under the influence of exogenous auxin type (NAA or IBA). The best caulogenesis response in case of each of the two subvarieties of Brussels cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> <b>oleracea</b> var. gemmifera) was recorded by experimental variant that consisted of using the explants of cotyledon type. While the best direct rhizogenesis response at Rosella subvariety of Brussels cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> <b>oleracea</b> var. gemmifera) was recorded on experimental variant that consisted of using NAA exogenous auxin 0. 25 mg/l, and in case of Sanda subvariety of Brussels cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> <b>oleracea</b> var. gemmifera) the best direct rhizogenesis response was recorded on experimental variant that consisted of using IBA exogenous auxin 0. 75 mg/l...|$|R

Alef. var. alba DC.) – Aros, Avak, Midor; cauliflower (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> botrytis (L.) Alef. var. botrytis L.) – Beta, Delta, Rober and savoy cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> capitata (L.) Alef. var. sabauda L.) – Vega, Versus. The diameter and weight of rosaces, resp. heads, was evaluated in the harvested production. After splitting the harvested crop into several groups, the percentage of non-standard portion of the yield was determined. The use of older seedlings (5 – 6 true leaves) for the white and savoy cabbage planting had a positive influence to both average yield and the harvest earliness. On the other hand, for the cauliflower conclusively better average crop of rosaces and earlier harvests were achieved with younger seedling transplanting (3 – 4 true leaves). Seedling flats proved to be the most suitable way of seedling preplantation; no {{differences were found between the}} characteristics of products cultivated from the seedling flats with 20 ml and 40 ml cell volumes.

40|$|Today, {{consumer}} awareness on the healthiness {{of their}} foodstuff increases. The main {{focus is on}} secondary metabolites and antioxidants. Broccoli (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> botrytis Alef. var. italica Plenck) has many compounds beneficial for human health, like Vitamin C, Carotionoids or Anthocyanins. To investigate these compounds two techniques are {{used in this study}} which are non-destructive sensor measurements (Multiplex®) to determine the value of anthocyanins (ANTH_RG) and flavonols (FLAV) and measurements of the antioxidant potential (water- (ACW) and lipid- (ACL) soluble antioxidants) on the basis of chemoluminescence. Field trials in autumn of 2011 and spring of 2012 were conducted in a randomized block design with different broccoli genotypes, named “Limba”, “Marathon F 1 ” and “TH-CAN-FK”. Measurements were done two times in 2011 and three times in 2012 on broccoli florets. Results indicate that the effect of the sampling date had a significant effect on FLAV, ANTH_RG, ACL and ACW values in Broccoli florets, while the effect of the genotype had only an influence on the ANTH_RG value. These effects may be due to less rainfall and pest infestations...|$|R
40|$|Broccolo fiolaro’ (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> Italica) is {{a typical}} {{vegetable}} produced in a restricted hill country area around Creazzo (Vicenza) in north-eastern Italy. The cultivation of this vegetable dates back several centuries ago, but a very few farms are still involved in the production. ‘Broccolo fiolaro’ is a variety of broccoli highly valued for its agronomic and organoleptic features. Four ‘Broccolo fiolaro’ selections were characterized by simple sequence repeats (SSRs) molecular markers and compared with other five cultivated varieties of broccoli of the Italica group in order to reconstruct their genetic structure and evaluate the degree of similarity among and within populations. The analysis of 12 SSR polymorphic loci pointed out a low genetic variability among the four ‘Broccolo fiolaro’ selections. Moreover, the whole ‘Fiolaro’ group showed significant differentiation from the other broccoli cultivars and could be easily distinguished by cluster analysis. An assignment test on, 30 genotyped plants randomly chosen from each broccoli population correctly recognized the proper accession 88 % of the time, proving this method to be useful for cultivar identification...|$|R

Alef. var. sabellica L.) was performed to investigate root distribution and N uptake in deep soil layers. • Root distribution was investigated by use of minirhizotrons and root extractions to 2. 4 m depth. The capacity for crop N uptake was studied by deep 15 NO 3 - placement followed by analysis of plant 15 N content after 3 - 30 days. • The atom percent 15 N excess (APE) of plant samples was of similar size after uptake of 15 N placed at depths {{in the range of}} 0. 4 - 2 m. Root colonisation and start of 15 N uptake were synchronized in 2. 4 m depth. • The deep roots had higher inflow of 15 N compared to the more shallow roots. Root depth was more important for the ability for NO 3 - uptake than root abundance. Thus deep roots can {{be important}} for N uptake and for reduction of NO 3 -¬ leaching from annual cropping systems. ...|$|R

Alef.) are oneof the most important Brassica cropsin this region where landraces aretraditionally grown by farmers on smallplots for either human or animal food. Fifteen kale populations from northwesternSpain were evaluated in two locations andtwo planting dates (early and late). Theobjectives were i) to study theirmorphological diversity, ii) to determinetheir relationships, and iii) to evaluatetheir morphological and agronomiccharacteristics that could be incorporatedto breeding programs in the future. Significant differences were found amongpopulations for all traits while genotype ×environment interaction was not significantfor most of them. Cluster and principalcomponent analysis were performed todetermine relationships among landraces andto obtain information on the usefulness ofthe characters for the definition ofgroups. The phenogram showed five groups,two groups including most of thepopulations and three small independentgroups. Groups of landraces were associatedwith the geographical origin and withmorphological differences amongpopulations, mainly with the length oftheir vegetative phase: north and earlypopulations (cluster A) and south and latepopulations (cluster B). Morphologicaldiversity was higher in coastal populationsthan in inland populations. As conclusion,the populations evaluated in this workdisplay a wide diversity of traits whichenable us to select and combine someinteresting landraces for important traitsin order to obtain improved varieties.

40|$|The plant {{responses}} to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) and to insect herbivory {{are believed to}} be partially similar. In this study, {{responses to}} these factors were investigated in the crop species broccoli (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> botrytis, Brassicaceae). Plants were first grown under three UV-B regimes (80 %, 23 %, and 4 % transmittance of ambient UV-B) in greenhouses covered with either innovative materials (high and medium transmittance) or conventional glass (low transmittance). Half of the plants then remained under these conditions, but the other half were transferred to the field with ambient light and herbivore access for up to 3 d. The plant responses to distinct environmental conditions were examined by analysing the morphological and chemical parameters of plants kept inside and plants exposed in the field. Furthermore, suitability of field-exposed plants to naturally occurring insects was investigated in relation to UV-B pretreatment. High levels of UV-B radiation led to increased flavonoid concentrations, but to a lower biomass accumulation in broccoli. These patterns remained after outdoor exposure. However, UV-induced changes of plant traits did not alter attractiveness to herbivorous insects: thrips, whiteflies, and aphids attacked plants independently of UV-B pretreatment. A 3 -fold increase of indolyl glucosinolate concentrations occurred in above-ground tissue of all the plants, most likely due to massive herbivore attack after 3 d of field exposure. The results show that plants respond with high specificity to different abiotic and biotic impacts, demonstrating the separate perception and processing of stress factors...|$|R
40|$|The onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a severe worldwide pest of white cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> capitata provar. capitata Duch.) for almost three decades. Although the most effective control measure {{is the use of}} resistant varieties, {{little is known about the}} resistance mechanism(s) involved. In 2007, a study at Tordas, Hungary, was carried out with 6 varieties to confirm that antixenosis is at least partly responsible for the resistance against onion thrips. The number of adult thrips and their progeny was counted on the outer ten head leaves at one-third of the heading process. At the same time, the light reflectance of old and outer head leaves was measured. The onion thrips damage was also assessed at full maturity. Antixenosis was found to be responsible for the resistance of ‘Balashi’, ‘Bloktor’ and ‘Riana’ varieties, since the number of adults and offspring found on head leaves was significantly lower than that of ‘Green gem’, ‘Hurricane’ and ‘Quisto’. The resistant varieties (‘Balashi’, ‘Bloktor’ and ‘Riana’) similarly suffered significantly lower damage than the susceptible ones (‘Green gem’, ‘Hurricane’ and ‘Quisto’). The light reflectance spectra of all six varieties were almost identical in the case of the old leaves, but a difference was found between the susceptible and resistant varieties when the reflectance of the outer head-forming leaves was measured. Similarly, the colour of the old leaves was not greatly different, but that of the outer head-forming leaves was correlated to the number of thrips adults found in the cabbage heads...|$|R
40|$|Leaching of NO 3 − from {{vegetable}} cropping {{systems can be}} very high compared to arable systems. This {{is a problem for}} vegetable growers in general as it decreases groundwater quality, and for organic growers in particular as the organic production is often limited by N. In a field experiment, we investigated the N uptake and root growth of three vegetables using minirhizotrons reaching 2. 4 m with the purpose to study the relationship between vegetable root distribution and uptake of NO 3 − from deep soil layers. NO 3 − uptake was studied over a 6 d period at the end of September by injection of 15 NO 3 − at four depths in the ranges: 0. 2 – 0. 8, 0. 6 – 1. 8, and 1 – 2. 5 m under late sweet corn (Zea mays L. convar. Saccharata Koern.), carrot (Daucus carota L.), and autumn white cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> capitata (L.) Alef. var. alba DC), respectively. The root depths of the three crops were 0. 6, 1. 3, and more than 2. 4 m, respectively. Uptake of 15 N was close to zero from placements below root depth, and linear relationships were found between root density and 15 N uptake from different depths. N inflow rates (uptake per unit root length) were in the same range for all species and depths. This indicates that the very different N use efficiencies often found for vegetable crops depend on species specific differences in root development over time and space, more than on differences in N uptake ability of the single root. Thus deep rooting is important for deep N uptake. Knowledge about deep root growth enables design of crop rotations with improved N use efficiency based on re-cycling of deep soil NO 3 − by vegetables...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} organic versus {{conventional}} growing practise on yield, quality, pests and diseases of three vegetable crops were examined. Cultivars of cauliflower (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> Botrytis), bulb onions (Allium cepa L.) and carrots (Daucus carota) were grown organically and conventionally {{during the years}} 2000 - 2003. Differences in cultivar yield, quality and resistance towards pests were determined. However, none of the cultivars were observed to be superior in the conventional compared to the organic growing system. Yields of conventional cauliflower and onions were higher than when grown organically, whereas no differences in carrot yields were observed between the two systems. A larger percentage of the harvested conventional onions were discarded, reducing the difference in net yield between the two systems. Generally, the reasons for discarding varied between the two systems. In organic cauliflower damage by slugs and loose curds were {{the main reasons for}} discarding. Loose curds can be explained by nitrogen deficiency while the damage by slugs is ascribed to the warm and humid environment created under insect nets used in the organic growing system. In both systems, the most severe reason for discarding of onions was exterior watery scales. Rot and mold were more pronounced in the conventional system whereas thick-necked onions were more frequent in the organic system due to larger distance between the onions. Conventional carrots were significantly more damaged by carrot flies than organic carrots even though the flies were present in the organic system and pesticides were applied in the conventional system. In contrast, more deform carrots were seen in the organic system. Generally, less organically crops were discarded due to pests, which presumably {{can be explained by the}} resistance of organic crops towards pests due to the increased diversity of microbial biomass and presence of insect natural enemies. On the contrary, the lower yields in organically grown vegetables can mainly be explained by morphological defects probably created by changes in growing system design in order to facilitate weed management. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{nitrogen}} (N) supply from hairy vetch grown as winter green manure on white cabbage was investigated in field trials performed on an organic farm in north-west Germany over two years. Hairy vetch was either used as green manure or harvested. One of two bare-soil fallow treatments was supplied with hairy vetch shoot mass to serve as reference. In 2002 and 2003, hairy vetch and weeds accumulated 136 and 178 kg ha- 1 of shoot N and yielded 3. 79 and 4. 72 t ha- 1, respectively. After ploughing and planting white cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> capitata var. capitata f. alba) for sauerkraut production {{at the beginning of}} June, the amount of soil mineral N (SMN) of the topsoil layer was biweekly investigated until canopy for about 6 - 8 weeks. In 2002, already within 2 weeks a maximum of 121 kg SMN ha- 1 for the green manure hairy vetch treatment was reached, whereas in 2003 a maximum of only 60 kg SMN ha- 1 was observed due to an exceptionally dry and warm season. In 2002, white cabbage shoot yielded an average 4. 4 t DM ha- 1 (range 3. 9 - 5. 1 t ha- 1 DM) and had accumulated on average 153 kg N ha- 1 (range 129 - 178 kg N ha- 1). Mean fresh matter yield (FM) of a single head was only 1. 2 kg (range 1. 1 - 1. 3 kg head- 1) due to severe pest damage. In the following year, the mean head yield was 5. 1 kg FM (range 3. 4 - 6. 4 kg) and head yield per hectare was 5. 8 t DM (range 4. 6 - 7. 5 t DM ha- 1) with a mean head N uptake of 182 kg ha- 1 (range 136 - 237 kg N ha- 1). The relationship between the weighted arithmetic daily mean of SMN for the first 6 - 8 weeks after the hairy vetch harvest date and the N uptake of cabbage at two sampling dates was significant, as were most correlations between presented core parameters.

40|$|The {{multifunctionality}} {{of living}} mulch systems was the underlying research question for field trials with cauliflower (<b>Brassica</b> <b>oleracea</b> L. <b>convar.</b> Botrytis) and leek (Allium porrum L.). Field trials were {{conducted at the}} Hessian Research Estate Frankenhausen over 3 years, parallel demonstration plots were established over 2 years on commercial pilot farms for entomological investigations in a big scale mode, plots of 1000 m². In all trials white clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{was used as a}} single species living mulch. In the years 2012 and 2013 the experimental design consisted of a 2 -factorial approach for the test of 3 cultivars and the effect of additive and substitutive system for the establisment of living. The cultivars of cauliflower were Chambord F 1, Belot F 1, and White ball, of leek Herbstriesen Hannibal, Axima, and Catcher F 1. For the substitutive system of living mulch each third row was replaced by clover with the potential of common weeding in the areas covered by vegetables. The establishment of clover took place between 4 weeks after planting or later. In 2014 a one year trial was added for the investigation of different sowing dates of living mulch, 2 and 4 weeks after planting, towards the performance of cauliflower and leek, cultivated with one cultivar. The two year pilot farm activities were located at two organic field vegetable farms in Northrhine-Westfalia, each site in one year. Crop yields were mainly influenced {{by the fact that the}} Substitutive system had a plant density which was 2 / 3 of the figures in control and Additive system. Therefore all figures found were significantly lower. Opposite to these findings the data referred to single crops showed an advantage for the Substitutive system. With regard to the second system tested the addition of clover into the vegetable system did not cause reductions of yields in any case. This was obvious on the levels of nutrient yields of the crops. The samples of pit fall traps were measured over a time span between August and midth of September in 2013 and midth of August till end of September in 2014. The estimates were done on a family level. The main groups were found at each site, in each crop as dominant: Carabidae >> Staphilinidae > Arachnidae.
