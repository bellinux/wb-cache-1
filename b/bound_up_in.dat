Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E

5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, and being able to use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock.

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. Hydrogen is in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high D–H ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere.

25|$|De' Barberi {{spent a year}} in Nuremberg, where Dürer lived, in 1500–1, and {{influences}} flowed in both directions between him and Dürer for a number of years. None of his engravings are dated, so much of the dating of them depends on resemblances to dated prints by Dürer; this is complicated by uncertainty in some cases as to who was influencing who. Five of his engravings were in an album of Hartmann Schedel's, which was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> December 1504, which gives further evidence as to dating. De' Barberi had probably made some engravings before leaving Italy, but his best engravings (and perhaps all of them) were probably done after his move to Germany in 1500.|$|E

25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is niacin <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn {{this may be}} up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{prayer is}} {{considered}} acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten adults—a minyan—is {{the most highly}} recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means {{over the age of}} 12 or 13 (bat or bar mitzvah). Judaism had originally counted only men in the minyan for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the minyan. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a minyan mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a minyan. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors. In Orthodox Judaism, according to some authorities, women can count in the minyan for certain specific prayers, such as the Birchot HaGomel blessing, which both men and women are obligated to say publicly.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, when Australia's {{part-time}} {{military force}} was re-raised {{under the guise}} of the Citizens Military Force, the battalion was re-raised albeit as an amalgamated unit. It was linked with the 58th Battalion to become the 58th/32nd Battalion and was known variously as the Melbourne Rifles, the West Melbourne Regiment and the City of Essendon Regiment. The Australian Army was reorganised around pentropic divisions in 1960. As a result of this reorganisation the CMF was greatly reduced, as 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while the 17 that remained gave up their old regional regimental ties and were reformed as part of the six newly raised State-based regiments. As a result of this, the 58th/32nd was absorbed by the pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment, forming 'E' Company, which was also known as [...] "The Footscray Company". The battalion received two battle honours for its service during the Second World War in 1961; {{at the same time it}} was also entrusted with the honours bestowed upon the 2/32nd Battalion, which was a separate battalion formed within the Second Australian Imperial Force. After the abolition of pentropic divisions in 1965, the unit's honours and traditions became <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment, a unit which remains in existence today.

500|$|In April 1982 Walde and Heidemann {{contacted}} Josef Henke and Klaus Oldenhage of the [...] (German Federal Archives) and Max Frei-Sulzer, {{the former}} head of the forensic department of the Zürich police, for assistance in authenticating the diaries. They did not specifically mention the diaries, but referred generally to new material. They also did not give the forensic specialists an entire diary, but removed one page only. For comparison purposes they also provided the experts with other samples of Hitler's writing, a handwritten draft for a telegram: this was from Heidemann's own collection and had also been forged by Kujau. Within days Walde provided further documents for comparison—all Kujau forgeries. Walde then flew to the US and commissioned Ordway Hilton, another forensic expert. None of those involved were experts in examining Nazi documents, and Hilton could not read German. Sterns management were too <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a secretive approach to be open about their source, or to provide the experts with a complete diary, which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material.

500|$|In royal {{charters}} he {{is often}} given the title [...] "royal chancellor", as he is styled in a 1062 charter in Latin regis cancellarius, {{but this does not}} necessarily mean that there was an official office known as chancellor similar to the later Lord Chancellor's office. Regenbald was probably in charge of Edward's royal clerks and scribes, but his position in the witness lists argues against his holding an actual office, as he is not listed early in the witness lists along with the magnates. He probably performed some of the duties that later were done by the chancellor, but the first chancellor in England is usually held to be Herfast, who held office from around 1069. Some historians, including David Bates, hold that Regenbald was chancellor, however. Some support for that position is the fact that Domesday Book lists Regenbald as [...] "chancellor". The entire issue of whether Regenbald was a [...] "true" [...] chancellor or not is <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the debate amongst medievalists about whether there was a recognisable chancery in England prior to the Norman Conquest. One school of thought, led by Pierre Chaplais, argues that no such office existed prior to the Conquest. Another group argues that there was, and among this group is the historian Simon Keynes. In Regenbald's case, a number of the documents that give him the title [...] "chancellor" [...] are either forgeries or have been altered in the copying process. Others, however, are not easily shown to be spurious.|$|E
