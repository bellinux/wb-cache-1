5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not stay to listen.|$|E

5|$|Carpenter never married, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> adopt {{a five-year-old}} girl, Rosanna in 1858. She died, in her sleep, at the Red Lodge in June 1877 and was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery. Her funeral cortège was {{half a mile}} long. A public meeting in October 1877 raised £2,700 {{to be spent on}} her reform schools and a {{memorial}} in Bristol Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Recipients {{consider}} the Golden Film {{to be an}} award given to films that are a success. Director Martin Koolhoven said, when Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, {{that he did not}} expect his film to be such a success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film. Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not expect it to receive a Golden Film.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter {{supported}} {{the movement for}} the higher education of women, and had always {{supported the}} feminist cause {{but for most of}} her life would not do so publicly, believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage. She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.|$|E

5|$|Constance {{was given}} in {{marriage}} to Raymond of Poitiers in 1136. During the subsequent years, Raymond ruled Antioch while Constance gave birth to four children. After Raymond was murdered after a battle in 1149, Fulk of Anjou's son, Baldwin III of Jerusalem, assumed the regency. He tried to persuade Constance to remarry, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not accept his candidates. She also refused to marry a middle-aged relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenus. Finally, she found a love interest and was married to Raynald of Châtillon, a knight from France, in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Hotspur {{did not see}} {{any action}} during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> escort an {{aircraft}} carrier in September during the later stages of the invasion of Madagascar. In June 1942 the ship returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta (Operation Vigorous). She was converted to an escort destroyer beginning in March 1943 in the United Kingdom and was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic {{for most of the}} rest of the war. After a lengthy refit in late 1944, Hotspur escorted convoys in the Irish Sea until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Iwami was {{assigned}} to the 1st Fleet on 26 November 1907 although she participated in the 1908 naval maneuvers as part of the 2nd Fleet before rejoining the 1st Fleet the following year. On 1 September 1912, the ship was reclassified as a second-class coastal defense ship. Shortly after the start of World War I in 1914, Iwami {{was assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, formed from captured Russian ships. The division blockaded the port and bombarded German defenses during the Siege of Tsingtao in August–November 1914. In 1915 Iwami was a guardship at Kure, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> participate in that year's naval maneuvers and subsequent fleet review.|$|E
5|$|Liguria {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} her career. She frequently was assigned to the main fleet, but in 1904 she was deployed to the American Station. In 1906, she conducted tests with coaling while at sea, and from 1908 to 1911, she was fitted with an experimental observation balloon. She saw extensive action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112. She took part in the seizure of Benghazi, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Tripoli, and conducted bombardments of Ottoman ports in western Libya and the Red Sea coast of Arabia. She was still in service during World War I as a training ship, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not see action during the conflict. Liguria was eventually sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|Raymond, Prince of Antioch, and {{thousands}} of his soldiers fell in the Battle of Inab on 28June 1148, leaving the principality almost undefended. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem (who was the cousin of Raymond's widow, Constance, the ruling Princess of Antioch) came to Antioch {{at the head of}} his army at least three times during the following years. To secure the defence of the principality, Baldwin tried to persuade her to remarry, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not accept his candidates. She also refused John Roger, whom the Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, proposed for her husband.|$|E

5|$|Several {{women were}} lined up as {{possible}} brides for Albert Victor. The first, in 1889, was his cousin Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not return his affections and refused his offer of engagement. She would later marry Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, another of Albert Victor's cousins, in 1894. The second, in 1890, was a love match with Princess Hélène of Orléans, a daughter of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, a pretender to the French throne who was living in England after being banished from France in 1886.|$|E
5|$|She {{continued}} {{this role}} as the UN troops recaptured Seoul days later. Boxer continued this support as UN troops advanced north and into North Korea, but departed for the United States on 11 November for refit and overhaul. US military commanders believed the war in Korea was over, and had ordered {{a number of other}} carriers out of the area and were subsequently under-prepared {{at the beginning of the}} Chosin Reservoir Campaign when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war against the UN. Battlefield commanders requested Boxer return to Korea as soon as possible, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not immediately return as commanders feared it might reduce the Navy's ability to respond if another conflict or emergency broke out elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|She was {{dispatched}} to the Far East on another tour on 11 January 1950. She joined the 7th Fleet in the region, making a goodwill visit to South Korea and entertaining South Korean president Syngman Rhee and his wife Franziska Donner. {{and at the end}} of the tour returned to San Diego on 25 June 1950, the same day as the outbreak of the Korean War. At the time, she was overdue for a maintenance overhaul, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not have time to complete it before being dispatched again.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of}} the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not commission any adult portraits, {{with the exception of the}} joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} {{served with the}} High Seas Fleet after {{entering}} service, with {{only one in the}} fleet at a time, usually trading service with the fleet either for refits or mine warfare training. After the start of World War I, the ships laid several minefields, both to protect the German coast and also to interfere with British naval operations. In 1915, Albatross was transferred to the Baltic Sea to operate against the Russian Baltic Fleet, where she was eventually ambushed by Russian cruisers and forced to beach in the Battle of Åland Islands in July. Nautilus took part in Operation Albion in 1917 and was rearmed in 1918 to support amphibious operations, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not see action in that role.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk {{achieved}} {{two stage}} {{victories in the}} Tour Féminin en Limousin and in the Giro della Toscana. In {{the middle of the}} season, Van Dijk suffered a clavicle fracture and as a result was hampered in the national championships. She finished 10th at the U-23 European Championships in Valkenburg and at the World University Cycling Championship, Van Dijk won the individual time trial and finished second in the road race. At the end of the season, Van Dijk was a reserve at the road world championships <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not race. At the Dutch National Track Championships she won bronze in the individual pursuit.|$|E
