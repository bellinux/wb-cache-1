5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E

40|$|The {{right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> has emerged {{so as to}} build legal {{foundations}} for data subjects to be relieved from misappropriation of personal data on the Internet. However, studies of information systems (IS) {{on the right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and related issues are rare as agreements of the right are diverse according to legal and cultural backgrounds. IS researchers should conduct both explorative and exploitative research in order to build a firm knowledge base for {{a better understanding of the}} right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> from the IS perspective. Doing so would help academia, legislators, and governments, and individuals to understand effects of the right on social, technological and psychological point of view. By suggesting a research agenda to investigate the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten,</b> this study sheds light on IS research direction of the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten...</b>|$|R
40|$|Private law {{enforcement}} {{of the right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> should <b>be</b> considered in light of the general characteristics of private law. This highlights advantages and limitations, and underlines the need to explicate the actual interests involved in the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> As case law and real-life examples show, enforcement is mostly feasible but may be costly. The right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>is</b> most effective against large, bona fide corporations. This analysis provides a more realistic view of the possibilities of private {{law enforcement}} of newly proclaimed rights...|$|R
5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding and {{refurbishing}} {{the palace}} took {{until well into}} the 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s. In 1989 a large trompe-l'œil fresco depicting the Roman goddess Ceres was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and white paint in the former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, Apartments). It is thought to have been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> since.|$|E
5|$|The Earl and Countess of Munster {{lived at}} Palmeira Square in Brighton. Later in life, Lady Munster became a novelist and short story writer. In 1889, she {{released}} her first novel, Dorinda; a second, A Scotch Earl, followed two years later. The year 1896 saw {{the publication of}} Ghostly Tales, a collection of tales on the supernatural which have largely <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> today. Lady Munster also produced an autobiography entitled My Memories and Miscellanies, which was released in 1904. She died two years later.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to review the}} meaning of the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> in a digital age in order to discuss implications on the information technology companies. This paper illustrate {{the meaning of the}} right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and the controversies surrounding it. And then the opportunities and implications for the company are suggested.

The right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> in the coming era of big data gives new opportunities to information technology companies.

50|$|The {{right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from the right to privacy, due to the distinction {{that the right to}} privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.|$|R
5|$|The {{group who}} {{had watched the}} {{departure}} of the trains {{from the top of the}} chimney near the Liverpool tunnel, meanwhile, had <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> in the confusion, and were unable to get down from their vantage point. Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others to follow him down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.|$|E
5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his standing with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had <b>been</b> <b>forgotten,</b> so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović was {{inspired}} to create the painting upon reading a book titled History of the Serb People while studying at the Munich Academy. The painting was poorly received by Belgrade's art critics. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson suggests {{this was due to}} its poor compositional and spatial conception. By the 1870s, Ivanović's works had largely <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> in Serbia. The Conquest of Belgrade was one of four paintings offered by Ivanović to the Gallery of Historical Portraits in 1874. The Gallery went on to form the nucleus of what was to become the National Museum of Serbia. The painting is currently in the possession of the National Museum.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} predates 300 BC, {{based on}} {{the style of the}} hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure in a form of Maya-Olmec syncretism, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, at a point where the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> and were viewed as powerful ancestors.|$|E
5|$|To {{underscore}} {{that the}} feast represents an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and sieved meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (Atlantic cod), figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (prunes). This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book. A description of a white-apron-clad chef and a reference to Prince Ossoliński's banquet in Rome, both found in Book 11, are also clearly inspired by Czerniecki's characterization of a master chef and his dedication, respectively.|$|E
5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had <b>been</b> <b>forgotten,</b> and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
40|$|A Research {{proposal}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of laws degreeThe right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>is</b> a data protection right that enables an individual to have personal data concerning themselves removed from the internet. Data Protection laws in Kenya are insufficient. The Data Protection Bill which was first drafted in 2008 {{is yet to be}} enacted in 2016. The internet has today become an important tool for many Kenyans that is used everyday yet there are insufficient laws to protect the data that they leave on the internet. In this paper I seek to determine whether Kenya should adopt the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> I examine the data protection laws in other countries to examine what a data protection right should entail. Then I look at the proposed right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> legislation and why the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>is</b> an important right. Finally I examine the situation in Kenya and find {{that there is a need}} for better Data Protection laws; even the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> upon examination of the Data Protection Bill is insufficient. Not only do they not provide for the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> or the right to erasure, it also fails to establish a regulatory authority to ensure compliance with the legislation. For these reasons I recommend that the Data Protection Bill should be amended to include the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and a proper regulatory authority should be set up under the Act. I also recommend that Data Protection should be a concern for the law makers who should amend the Bill and pass it...|$|R

5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already <b>been</b> <b>forgotten</b> by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E

40|$|The Court of Justice of the E. U. ’s {{right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> ruling, which {{subjected}} search engines to the Data Protection Directive’s restrictions, was controversial {{from the moment}} it was delivered. Free speech advocates claimed that the ruling authorized needless censorship, while privacy rights advocates argued that the ruling provided much-needed privacy protection in the internet age. The right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> ruling <b>is</b> deliberately broad, yet reinforces the Directive’s journalistic exception to protect free speech. However, the CJEU’s failure to define the term “search engine” in its decision unintentionally allows the Directive’s exception to be circumvented. More countries outside the E.

A few countries are skeptical of recognizing a right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> due to its breadth, which could be made worse if the term “search engine” is not refined. While the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> could <b>be</b> incorporated into existing international law, having search engines apply their right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> policies internationally <b>is</b> the most realistic way of meeting the growing demand. Therefore, these concerns must be addressed so that search engines can comfortably satisfy the global community’s need to protect citizens’ data privacy...|$|R
