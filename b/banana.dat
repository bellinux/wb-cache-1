5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{applies to}} unripened green <b>bananas,</b> {{and thus to}} growers and wholesalers rather than retailers. The main provisions of the regulation were that <b>bananas</b> sold as unripened, green <b>bananas</b> should be green and unripened, firm and intact, fit for human consumption, not [...] "affected by rotting", clean, free of pests and damage from pests, free from deformation or abnormal curvature, free from bruising, free of any foreign smell or taste. The minimum size (with tolerances and exceptions) is a length of 14 cm and a thickness (grade) of 2.7 cm. It specifies minimum standards for specific quality classifications of <b>bananas</b> (Extra, Class I, Class II). Only Extra class <b>bananas</b> have to comply fully with the shape specifications. Class II <b>bananas,</b> for instance are permitted to have [...] "defects of shape"; Class I <b>bananas</b> are permitted only [...] "slight defects of shape". This is not true, however, of the size specifications; sale of <b>bananas</b> below the minimum size is almost always prohibited (with exceptions only for <b>bananas</b> from a few regions where <b>bananas</b> are traditionally smaller).|$|R

5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on <b>banana</b> leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising <b>banana</b> leaves or the sheaths of the <b>banana</b> trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on <b>banana</b> leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E

30|$|Determining <b>banana’s</b> {{ripening}} stages {{is becoming}} an essential requirement for standardizing the quality of commercial <b>bananas.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture which is designed specifically for the fine-grained classification of <b>banana’s</b> ripening stages. It learns a set of fine-grained image features based on a data-driven mechanism and offers a deep indicator of <b>banana’s</b> ripening stage. The resulted indicator can help to differentiate the subtle differences among subordinate classes of <b>bananas</b> in ripening state. Experimental results from 17, 312 images of <b>bananas</b> in different ripening stages show that our deep indicator achieves an accuracy superior significantly to state-of-the-art computer vision-based systems both in rough- and fine-grained classification of ripening stages no matter the <b>bananas</b> bear or not severe defects.|$|R

5000|$|In Southeast Asia - {{the center}} of {{diversity}} for <b>bananas,</b> both wild and cultivated - the distinction between [...] "bananas" [...] and [...] "plantains" [...] does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many <b>bananas</b> are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking <b>bananas</b> which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas. Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between [...] "bananas" [...] and [...] "plantains" [...] that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both Cavendish cultivars, the classic yellow dessert <b>bananas,</b> and Saba cultivars, used mainly for cooking, are called pisang in Malaysia and Indonesia, kluai in Thailand and chuoi in Vietnam. Fe'i <b>bananas,</b> grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional <b>bananas</b> and plantains. Most Fe'i <b>bananas</b> are cooked, but Karat <b>bananas,</b> which are short and squat with bright red skins, {{very different from the}} usual yellow dessert <b>bananas,</b> are eaten raw.|$|R

40|$|Some {{farmers in}} Uganda believe that {{fertilizers}} negatively affect the sensory attributes of cooking type <b>bananas.</b> This belief may hamper {{the adoption of}} fertilizers. To verify the validity of this belief, bunches (Musa AAA-EA, cv. ‘Kisansa’) from fertilized (i. e. N-P-K-Mg-Zn-S-B-Mo) and non-fertilized plots were harvested from on-station trials in central (Wakiso) and southwestern (Ntungamo) Uganda. Samples were anonymously tagged for preparation (boiled or steamed) and sensory evaluation by farmers from southwestern (n= 33) and central Uganda (n= 35). Data were analyzed in STATA using Tau-b rank test for proportions, median ranks and odds ratios. The frequency of evaluators ranking fertilized steamed <b>bananas</b> highly (i. e. ‘Best’ or ‘Second-best’) was significantly (P= 0. 05) higher (60 %) than for non-fertilized <b>bananas</b> (42 %). The opposite was true for boiled <b>bananas</b> (fertilized, 43 % vs. non-fertilized, 60 %). Irrespective of site of cultivation and evaluators’ origin, gender or age, fertilizers significantly (P= 0. 05) improved the appearance, odor, softness and acceptability of steamed <b>bananas.</b> For boiled <b>bananas,</b> attributes did not significantly differ between fertilizer treatments, except for appearance, which was significantly inferior (P= 0. 05) for fertilized <b>bananas.</b> This study shows that the belief that fertilizers negatively affect the sensory attributes of cooking type <b>bananas</b> is generally incorrect. Only when boiled, fertilized <b>bananas</b> appeared less attractive than non-fertilized <b>bananas.</b> The dominant and traditional way of preparing cooking type <b>bananas</b> in Uganda is through steaming (i. e., matooke). We recommend the application of fertilizer, as it will not only positively affect yield, but also the sensory quality of cooking type <b>bananas...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Export <b>bananas</b> {{are picked}} green, and ripen in special rooms upon {{arrival in the}} {{destination}} country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with ethylene gas to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket <b>bananas</b> is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process. Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. <b>Bananas</b> are refrigerated to between 13.5 and 15 C during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the <b>bananas</b> turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe <b>bananas</b> quickly blackens in the 4 C environment of a domestic refrigerator, although the fruit inside remains unaffected."Tree-ripened" [...] Cavendish <b>bananas</b> have a greenish-yellow appearance which changes to a brownish-yellow as they ripen further. Although both flavor and texture of tree-ripened <b>bananas</b> is generally regarded as superior to any type of green-picked fruit, this reduces shelf life to only 7-10 days.|$|R
