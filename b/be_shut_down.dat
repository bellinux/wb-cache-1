5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Ontario, Canada, with Toronto and its {{surrounding}} suburbs being a stand-in for Raccoon City. It was originally feared that production would <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> due to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> The explosion {{was caused by}} failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{a provincial}} {{government}} commitment {{to phase out}} all coal generating plants, two units at Nanticoke <b>were</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> in fall 2010. Another two <b>were</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> in 2011. The final four <b>were</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> on December 31, 2013.|$|R

In 1994 the lignite {{power plant}} <b>was</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> In 1998 the gas turbine power plant <b>was</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> and on September 22, 2001 the chimneys were demolished by explosives. In 2005 the oil tanks {{of the gas}} turbine plant were demolished.|$|R
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to explain {{that he was doing}} {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment is running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked {{some of his colleagues}} with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2011, Electronic Arts {{announced}} that the online game servers would <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> on January 11, 2011 for the Xbox 360 format of the game. The PC version of the game was shut down on December 31, 2010. Electronic Arts noted that their discontinuation {{of support for the}} game was partly because the licensing deal with New Line Cinema (holders of the Lord of the Rings license) had expired, which led them to no other option than to shut down all online services for the game.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
50|$|On May 1, the two {{assembly}} plants in Canada, Brampton Assembly and Windsor Assembly, both located in Ontario, <b>were</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> indefinitely. The <b>shut</b> <b>downs</b> affected about 2,700 and 4,400 employees respectively. A Chrysler parts plant in Etobicoke, Toronto operated until May 10, when it <b>was</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down,</b> affecting 300 employees.|$|R

5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down,</b> and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747-200 {{registration}} G-BDXH, {{flew through}} {{a cloud of}} volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched {{to such an extent}} that it was difficult for the pilots to see out of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport just outside Jakarta. There were no fatalities or injuries.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2010, Microsoft {{announced}} Age of Empires Online, {{which was}} a free-to-play Games for Windows Live online game, it developed in collaboration with Robot Entertainment. It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that lets you progress at your own pace. Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, {{as well as more}} quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> due to the content being too expensive to maintain.|$|E
5|$|The Ratsiraka {{administration}} {{launched an}} inquiry into Tiko business practices in September 2000 and issued an executive decision in June 2001 that the company should <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> for failure to adhere to a 1996 agreement requiring Tiko to create jobs and produce low-cost vegetable oil; this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court on 16 October 2002. A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana's business practices, including a court judgment {{on the eve of}} the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes, but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted in a criminal conviction.|$|E

5|$|The game {{world is}} filled with traps, laser defence {{mechanisms}} and security robots, all of which kill the astronaut on contact, resulting {{in the loss of}} one of his five lives. These defences must <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> with objects obtained from gravity boxes in order to progress, as the player has no weapon to directly attack the robots with. The jet pack enables the astronaut to travel more quickly, but has a limited supply of nitro fuel. Should this fuel run out then the astronaut will lose a life. The spaceship contains points at which the jet pack can be refuelled, though these can be difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E
5|$|Ulrich {{provided}} {{a statement to}} the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or <b>be</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E
