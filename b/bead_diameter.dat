The {{purpose of this study}} is to define critical factors that affect toxic NO production from the macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7 in response to alginate microcapsules.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a parallel plate shear cell {{for the study of}} large scale shear flows in granular materials is presented. The parallel plate geometry allows for shear studies without the effects of curvature found in the more common Couette experiments. A system of independently movable slats creates a well with side walls that deform in response to the motions of grains within the pack. This allows for true parallel plate shear with minimal interference from the containing geometry. The motions of the side walls also allow for a direct measurement of the velocity profile across the granular pack. Results are presented for applying this system to the study of transients in granular shear and for shear-induced crystallization. Initial shear profiles are found to vary from packing to packing, ranging from a linear profile across the entire system to an exponential decay with a width of approximately 6 <b>bead</b> <b>diameters.</b> As the system is sheared, the velocity profile becomes much sharper, resembling an exponential decay with a width of roughly 3 <b>bead</b> <b>diameters.</b> Further shearing produces velocity profiles which can no longer be fit to an exponential decay, but are better represented as a Gaussian decay or error function profile. Cyclic shear is found to produce large scale ordering of the granular pack, which has a profound impact on the shear profile. There exist periods of time in which there is slipping between layers as well as periods of time in which the layered particles lock together resulting in very little relative motion.

40|$|To achieve high {{efficiency}} lithium ion batteries (LIBs), an effective active material is important. In this regard, monodisperse mesoporous titania beads (MMTBs) featuring well interconnected nanoparticles were synthesised, and their mesoporous properties were tuned {{to study how}} these affect the electrochemical performance in LIBs. Two pore diameters of 15 and 25 nm, three bead diameters of 360, 800 and 2100 nm, and various annealing temperatures (from 300 to 650 °C) were investigated. The electrochemical results showed that while the pore size does not significantly influence the electrochemical behaviour, the specific surface area and the nanocrystal size affect the performance. Also, there is an optimum annealing temperature that enhances electron transfer across the titania bead structure. The carbon content employed in the electrode was varied, showing that the <b>bead</b> <b>diameter</b> strongly influences the minimal content of the conductive carbon required to fabricate the electrode. As a general rule, the smaller the <b>bead</b> <b>diameter,</b> the more carbon was required in the electrode.

A set of three different polymer <b>beads</b> (<b>diameter</b> ca. 170 mu m), each bearing different functional groups at their surface, are used to covalently attach distinct functional molecules exclusively on opposing poles of the beads.
