2500|$|Salts {{freezing}} - Fluoride salt mixtures have melting points {{ranging from}} 300 to 600°C (...) [...] The salts, {{especially those with}} beryllium fluoride, are very viscous near their freezing point. This requires careful design and freeze protection in the containment and heat exchangers. Freezing must be prevented in normal operation, during transients, and during extended downtime. The primary loop salt contains the decay heat-generating fission products, which help to maintain the required temperature. For the MSBR, ORNL planned on keeping the entire reactor room (the hot cell) at high temperature. This avoided the need for individual electric heater lines on all piping and provided more even heating of the primary loop components. One [...] "liquid oven" [...] concept developed for molten salt-cooled, solid-fueled reactors employs a separate <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> pool containing the entire primary loop. Because of the high heat capacity and considerable density of the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt,</b> the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> prevents fuel salt freezing and participates in the passive decay heat cooling system, provides radiation shielding and reduces deadweight stresses on primary loop components. This design could also be adopted for LFTRs.|$|E

50|$|The destaining {{solution}} for CBB contains usually the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and {{a fraction of}} 30%-50% organic solvent (mostly acetonitrile). The hydrophobic interactions between protein and CBB are reduced by the organic fraction of the solution. At the same time, the ionic {{part of the solution}} diminishes the electrostatic bonds between the dye and the positively charged amino acids of the protein. In contrast to a mixture of water with organic solvent the effectivity of destaining is increased. An increase of temperature promotes the destaining process. To a certain degree (< 10%) the destaining procedure is accompanied with a loss of protein. Furthermore, the removal of CBB does not affect the yield of peptides in the mass spectrometric measurement.|$|E

Even when the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> is identical to the modulator salt, gradient deformation is observed; the extent of deformation increases as the volume of the feed is increased. When the modulator salt is different from the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt,</b> unusual effects are observed, and the chromatograms are quite different from those predicted by classical gradient elution theory. In particular, local increases in the buffer concentration are found between feed bands, and serve to improve the separation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the lyophilisation medium (enzyme plus <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> and additives) and of water activity (a(w)) on the catalytic properties of lipase from Chromobacterium viscosum (lipase CV) in organic solvents; catalysis of ester and lactone synthesis were compared and, despite the similarities of the reactive groups involved in these reactions, some interesting differences were observed. Including 2 -[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer in the lyophilisation medium of lipase CV increased its catalytic activity in transesterification and lactonisation, although the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> requirement for maximal activity differed between the two reactions. Sorbitol, glucose, lactose, 18 -crown- 6 (crown ether 18 -C- 6), beta-cyclodextrin and bovine serum albumin were employed as alternative additives in the transesterification reaction, but were not as effective as MES <b>buffer.</b> <b>Salt</b> hydrates were used to investigate the effect of a(w) on esterification and lactonisation reactions catalysed by lipase CV. The maximum rate of hexadecanolide synthesis in toluene occurred at a(w) = 0. 48. The optimum a(w) for the transesterification reaction in heptane/alcohol mixtures depended on the alcohol substrate employed (1 -heptanol, 2 -heptanol, or 3 -methyl- 3 -hexanol) but not on the acyl donor (p-NP acetate or caprylate). The optimum a(w) values for both reactions were unchanged when a common solvent system (toluene/ 1 -heptanol) was employed, indicating that the dependence of enzyme activity on a(w) is an intrinsic property of the enzyme-catalysed reaction and not a function of the solvent or other additives...|$|E

High quality research evidence suggests that fluid type can impact on important patient outcomes. When new knowledge is generated {{the next step is}} translating this evidence into practice to ensure patients receive the best available treatments. The aim of this thesis was to use mixed methods to describe national and international trends of fluid resuscitation use in relation to key published research between 2007 and 2013 to determine if knowledge translation had occurred and secondly to describe key drivers for clinicians’ choice of fluid resuscitation. The main findings are: 1) In a series of point prevalence studies tracking fluid resuscitation practices in Australia and New Zealand over a 6 -year period: a. Fluid resuscitation practices changed between 2007 and 2013 b. The use of 0. 9 % sodium chloride remained unchanged, but the use of <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solutions increased c. There was a decreased use of semi-synthetic colloids, specifically gelatin 2) In a large international cross-sectional study of fluid resuscitation practices in 2014 : a. Crystalloids were used more often than colloids b. The drivers for this were increasing use of <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solutions and a decreasing use of the semi-synthetic colloids gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch c. Geographical location was an independent determinant for the type of fluid administered 3) In an analysis of fluid resuscitation practices in the same intensive care units from two international cross-sectional studies: a.

Compared with their monocationic analogues, the dicationic ionic liquids stationary phases presented effective retention and good selectivity for typical hydrophilic compounds under HILIC mode with the column efficiency as high as 130, 000 plates/m. Moreover, the influence of different alkyl chain spacer between dications and combined anions on the retention behavior and selectivity of the dicationic ionic liquids stationary phases under HILIC mode was displayed. The results indicated that the longer linkage chain would decrease the hydrophilicity and retention on the dicationic ionic liquid stationary phase, and while differently combined anions had no difference due to the exchangeability under the common HILIC mobile phase with <b>buffer</b> <b>salt.</b> Finally, the retention mechanism was investigated by evaluating the effect of chromatographic factors on retention, including the water content in the mobile phase, the mobile phase pH and <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> concentration.

40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} phenomena {{are very}} common in pool type reactor systems, such as the liquid-salt cooled Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) and liquid-metal cooled fast reactor systems such as the Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR). It is important to accurately predict the temperature and density distributions both for design optimation and accident analysis. Current major reactor system analysis codes such as RELAP 5 (for LWR’s, and recently extended to analyze high temperature reactors), TRAC (for LWR’s), and SASSYS (for liquid metal fast reactors) only provide lumped-volume based models which can only give very approximate results and can only handle simple cases with one mixing source. While 2 -D or 3 -D CFD methods {{can be used to}} analyze simple configurations, these methods require very fine grid resolution to resolve thin substructures such as jets and wall boundaries, yet such fine grid resolution is difficult or impossible to provide for studying the reactor response to transients due to computational expense. Therefore, new methods are needed to support design optimization and safety analysis of Generation IV pool type reactor systems. Previous scaling has shown that stratified mixing processes in large stably stratified enclosures can be described using one-dimensional differential equations, with the vertical transport by free and wall jets modeled using standard integral techniques. This allows very large reductions in computational effort compared to three-dimensional numerical modeling of turbulent mixing in large enclosures. The BMIX++ (Berkeley mechanistic MIXing code in C++) code was originally developed at UC Berkeley to implement such ideas. This code solves mixing and heat transfer problems in stably stratified enclosures. The code uses a Lagrangian approach to solve 1 -D transient governing equations for the ambient fluid and uses analytical or 1 -D integral models to compute substructures. By including liquid salt properties, BMIX++ code is extended to analyze liquid salt pool systems in the current AHTR design, to provide an example of its application. Similar analysis is possible for liquid-metal cooled reactors. The current AHTR baseline design uses a large <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> tank to provide more thermal inertial and safety margin. Reactor vessel, intermediate heat exchangers, pool reactor auxiliary cooling system heat exchangers (PHX), and direct reactor auxiliary cooling system heat exchangers (DHX) are all immerged in the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> pool. These structures provide major driving sources for vertical mixing and thermal stratification. Predication of the temperature distribution within the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> tank directly affects the major safety systems design, such as the PHX and DHX, safety analysis results, and structure thermal stresses analysis. The BMIX++ code is used to predict mixing and thermal stratification in this pool system. This example shows the potential of 1 -D analysis methods and BMIX++ to be included in system analysis codes for pool type of Gen-IV reactor systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the ion abundances in the thermospray (TSP) mass spectra of several pesticides, including anilides, carbamates, N-heterocyclic and organophosphorus compounds and phenylureas on the vaporizer and the gas-phase temperatures and under collision-activated dissociation conditions was investigated. The results clearly demonstrate that fragmentation in the TSP mass spectra of the investigated pesticides was mainly caused by gas- or liquid-phase "chemical dissociation" reactions of neutral analyte molecules or, in some instances, of the quasi-molecular ions in the ion source or the vaporizer probe, probably induced by solvent or buffer ions which can be described by well defined mechanisms. A linear relationship was observed for most of those pesticides which showed {{combinations of the two}} quasi-molecular ions [M + H]+ and [M + NH 4]+, when the logarithm of the ion abundance ratio for the [M + H]+ ion relative to the [M + NH 4]+ ion was plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature of the gas phase. It is shown that this dependence can be used to generate TSP mass spectra with mainly one quasi-molecular ion. This may be of value for selected-ion monitoring experiments, because the total ion current (i. e., the sum of the [M+ H]+ and [M+ NH 4]+ ions) is less dependent on the gas-phase temperature than the ion currents of the individual quasi-molecular ions. It was found that additional adduct ions beside these quasi-molecular ions could be observed in the spectra of several pesticides for which the formation was limited to low gas-phase temperatures. In addition, the results for the investigated quaternary ammonium compounds clearly show that the addition of a volatile <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> to the mobile phase induces chemical reactions in the gas phase which have a strong influence on the ion abundances. However, addition of <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> was necessary to obtain intense signals although the compounds are already completely dissociated in the aqueous solvent and fragmentation was enhanced as the buffer concentration was raised...|$|E

Moreover, the MG 45 glass never exhibited hydroxyapatite crystal formation on its surface also after soaking in calcium- containing solutions. The apatite crystallisation and deposition mechanism, typical of a bioactive glass, was induced only if the glass itself contained calcium. The contemporaneous presence of calcium in the glass and in the soaking solution improved the reactivity of the glass, as apatite crystals nucleated in a shorter time and grew more quickly.

40|$|Mass Spectrometry (MS) {{has been}} widely {{reported}} for measuring the conversion of substrates to products for enzyme assays. These measurements are typically performed by time-consuming LC-MS to eliminate <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> that interfere with electrospray ionization MS. However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS) offers a label-free and direct readout of substrate and product, a fast sampling rate, and is tolerant of many <b>buffer</b> <b>salts,</b> reagents, and compounds that are typically found in enzyme reaction mixtures.

Typical reproducibility parameters were < 7 % RSD—a value comparable to ESI MS quantitative assays and well within the acceptable limits for screening assays. The speed of the MALDI readout is currently about 10 s per sample, thus allowing for over 7500 samples/day. From a simplicity standpoint, the enzymatic reaction mixtures are prepared by liquid handling robots, the reactions are stopped by addition of a 10 times volume of acidic matrix solution, and the samples are simultaneously transferred to MALDI target plate for analysis.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the enzymic activity of bilirubin oxidase {{when it is}} suspended as a lyophilized powder in a low-water system. The enzyme required <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> {{and a source of}} water to show activity. This study {{investigated the}} complete range of water thermodynamic activity (a(w)) by combining the use of salt hydrates and two-phase systems with concentrated solutes in the aqueous phase. When free water was added, activity reached a maximum at a defined water content, but this maximum increased with buffer content, suggesting that there was competition for water with the <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> from which the enzyme was lyophilized. Alternatively, a range of salt hydrates was used, each able to fix the water activity (a(w)) at a different value. By providing water to the organic solvent phase in this way, the dependency of enzyme activity upon a(w) was investigated and shown to be independent of buffer concentration. However, the optimum a(w) was uncertain because the available a(w) range for salt hydrates is < or = 0. 90. Investigation of the remaining water activity range was made possible by using an a(w) depressor (sorbitol) to lower the a(w) of a two-phase system. The optimum a(w) for the bilirubin oxidase activity in this two-phase system was a(w) = 0. 936, independent of buffer concentration. The study therefore confirmed the need to control the water 'available' to low-water systems and the dependence of enzyme activity on water thermodynamic activity (a(w)) not water content...|$|R

NADPH is oxidized to metabolically active NADP+ in a solution of autoxidizing DL-glyceraldehyde at rates of up to 15 X 10 (- 4) A 340 /min. The close parallelism between the effects of <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> type and concentration, monosaccharide structure and temperature activation on autoxidation and NADPH oxidation imply that autoxidation {{is a prerequisite for}} the NADPH oxidation, probably via the hydroperoxy radical. Nucleotide-binding proteins enhanced NADPH oxidation induced by DL-glyceraldehyde, up to 10. 6 -fold with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Glutathione reductase-catalysed NADPH oxidation in the presence of autoxidizing monosaccharide showed many characteristics of the aldose reductase reaction. Aldose reductase inhibitors acted as antioxidants in inhibiting this NADPH oxidation. These results indicate that low apparent aldose reductase activities may be due to artifacts of monosaccharide autoxidation, and could provide an explanation for the non-linear steady-state kinetics observed with DL-glyceraldehyde and aldose reductase...|$|E

The MRD method identifies coexisting oligomers from their rotational correlation times and determines their relative populations from the associated dispersion amplitudes. From MRD-derived correlation times and hydrodynamic model calculations, we confirm that BLG-A dimers associate to octamers below room temperature.

40|$|Flow cytometry was {{utilized}} {{to measure the}} in-flux of calcium into fresh and frozen-thawed equine and bovine spermatozoa that had been treated with ei-ther dilauroyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC- 12) or the cal-cium ionophore A 23187 (A 23187) to initiate sperm capacitation. Sperm suspensions were stained with the fluorescent calcium indicator, Fluo- 3, to measure intra-cellular calcium concentrations and with propidium iodide (PI) to evaluate sperm viability. After staining, sperm were incubated at 37 oC in a Hepes <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> medium (BGM 3,control) with either PC- 12 or A 23187 and analyzed just prior to (time 0) and 1, 5, 15 and 30 min after addition of capacitating agents. When fresh stallion sperm were treated with either BGM 3 (control...|$|R
40|$|We have {{prepared}} cytoskeletons from normal and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells by extraction with nonionic detergents in a <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solution designed {{to preserve the}} structure as it exists in vivo. Virtually all of the phosphoprotein pp 60 src in the cell is bound to such cytoskeletons. Furthermore, when these cytoskeletons are incubated in situ with [gamma- 32 P]ATP, pp 60 src is phosphorylated. Labeling of other apparently transformation-specific cytoskeletons phosphoproteins is also observed. These results directly demonstrate an association between pp 60 src and elements of the cytoskeleton and suggest that pp 60 src may exert {{at least some of}} its effects as a consequence of its interaction with this cellular framework...|$|R
30|$|In our buffer-based {{synthesis}} systems, these buffers displayed significant affinity to {{a number}} of metal ions, resulting in the formation of metal complexes. However, these buffer complexes are not stable and are readily oxidized by Au(III). This oxidation is accompanied by the simultaneous reduction of Au(III) to Au(II)/Au(I), and finally to Au(0), which results in the formation of Au NPs. NP formation can be completed within a few seconds to a few hours, depending on the buffer chemical, and the formed particles are stable for periods ranging from a few days to several months. BTM, containing five hydroxyl groups, was found to induce the spontaneous, instant formation of Au NPs at room temperature. The second fastest Au NP formations occurred when using the TEA and PIPES buffers. The three hydroxyl groups in TEA and the –SO 3 H groups and piperazine rings in PIPES and PIPES-SS were able to reduce Au(III) to Au(0) within a few minutes at room temperature. Note that this short reaction time may induce less size and shape homogeneity in the formed NPs, as it provides insufficient time to allow for Ostwald ripening. The other buffers contain either electron-donating groups or fewer electron-withdrawing groups, which result in slower oxidation reactions; these require heating at 100  °C to accelerate the formation of Au NPs. Unreacted <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> may introduce additional confusion to the research in this field. Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 a depicts unreacted <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> with cubic structures. After washing and re-dispersing in water, these salts form urchin-like structures (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 b), which ultimately break into many small parts (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 e).|$|R
