5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart <b>beat.</b> <b>This</b> may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E

In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According to Dave Carter, a writer for Comics <b>Beat,</b> <b>this</b> is a typical sales pattern for a modern comic. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300.

This record stood for 29 years. It was broken in 2009 by Luiz Arapiraca wearing a new technology super-suit manufactured by Jaked in Italy.

At the time, Green Party candidate Jill Stein's popular vote total made her the most successful female presidential candidate in a general election in United States history.

25|$|Most {{cephalopods}} {{possess a}} single pair of large nephridia. Filtered nitrogenous waste {{is produced in}} the pericardial cavity of the branchial hearts, each of which is connected to a nephridium by a narrow canal. The canal delivers the excreta to a bladder-like renal sac, and also resorbs excess water from the filtrate. Several outgrowths of the lateral vena cava project into the renal sac, continuously inflating and deflating as the branchial hearts <b>beat.</b> <b>This</b> action helps to pump the secreted waste into the sacs, to be released into the mantle cavity through a pore.|$|E

500|$|Darling {{was born}} on 21 November 1870 in Glen Osmond, South Australia, the sixth son of John Darling, a grain {{merchant}} and his wife Isabella, née Ferguson. He was educated at Prince Alfred College, where he {{took an interest in}} cricket. At the age of 15, he scored a record 252runs in the [...] "inter-collegiate" [...] match, the annual fixture against fierce rival St Peter's College. His future Test team mate, Clem Hill, would later <b>beat</b> <b>this</b> record, scoring 360. [...] Not long after, he was included in a combined South Australian/Victoria XV that played the Australian XI in 1886. He made only 16 runs, but the manner in which he made them saw senior players hail him as a future champion.|$|E

Tom Dumoulin <b>beat</b> <b>this</b> by one second, but was in turn beaten by one second by Michael Matthews, the seventh-last rider to take to the course. The final riders, including Porte and Geraint Thomas, were unable to beat Matthews's time. Thomas finished seventh, losing seven seconds to Matthews, with Porte eleventh, a further three seconds back. Contador finished 27th, sixteen seconds behind Matthews, with Talansky and Bardet finishing even further behind. Matthews described it as [...] "very special" [...] to beat Dumoulin, one of the best time-triallists in the world, and said that he hoped to stay in the yellow jersey of the race leader [...] "as long as possible".|$|E

2500|$|The {{resolution}} is especially appropriate if the written melody resolves from a fourth {{to a third}} above the root (e.g., if the chord G sus 4, in the key of C Major, lasts a bar in 4/4, and the melody note resolves from the note [...] "C" [...] for two beats and then the note [...] "B" [...] for two <b>beats,</b> <b>this</b> 4-3 resolution in the melody will often be mirrored by chord-playing musicians shifting from G sus 4 to G Major. If {{the intent of the}} composer/songwriter is to leave the tension unresolved in the backing band, she may write [...] "N.C" [...] (no chord) after the G sus 4 chord is sounded for the first two <b>beats.</b> <b>This</b> instructs the chord-playing musicians not to play any chord.|$|R

500|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} Night Dive Studios did following the acquisition of the rights was to develop System Shock: Enhanced Edition, which was released via GOG.com on September 22, 2015 for Microsoft Windows. Similar to the System Shock 2 update, this version is intended to run on modern systems significantly easier among several other technical improvements such as the original resolution of 320x200, now boosted up to 1024x768 and 854x480 pixels in widescreen mode. The release also includes the original version of the game, titled System Shock: Classic, with support for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. System Shock: Enhanced Edition received very positive reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 85 out of 100, based on nine critic reviews. Cameron Farney of COGconnected said, [...] "If you haven't played System Shock before, there’s never been a better time. Whether you’re into shooters or RPGs; or just want to experience a cyberpunk romp with a good <b>beat,</b> <b>this</b> one is for you." ...|$|E

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father <b>beat</b> <b>this</b> legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

500|$|Even though several throwers, {{including}} Nilsen, still towered above Thorkildsen on {{the world}} list, the Olympic javelin contest was regarded as widely open – [...] "one of the most open finals in Olympic history", according to the IAAF Olympic coverage. Thorkildsen threw 81.74m in the qualification round, barely earning a mention in the event report as he safely passed the automatic qualifier mark of 81metres to go through to the final. Breaux Greer won the qualification with 87.25 m, but left the stadium in a limping state. In the javelin final held two days later, Thorkildsen opened with an 84.82m release which saw him ranked third {{at the end of}} the first round. Vadims Vasiļevskis of Latvia had thrown a personal best of 84.95m to earn a surprising lead ahead of reigning World champion Sergey Makarov. In the second round Thorkildsen threw a personal best of 86.50metres. As neither Aleksandr Ivanov, Greer nor anyone else managed to <b>beat</b> <b>this,</b> Thorkildsen won a surprising Olympic gold medal with Vasiļevskis and Makarov staying in place to take the silver and bronze medals respectively. Commenting on his win, Thorkildsen described the feeling as [...] "completely insane". A second place behind Breaux Greer at the World Athletics Final in Monte Carlo rounded off the season.|$|E

2500|$|A similar {{criticism}} {{is that a}} team with similar or better arguments to another team can be {{left out of the}} BCS despite beating the other team. This happened between Miami (Florida) and Florida State University in 2000, where Miami beat Florida St. yet Florida St. went to the National Championship Game. [...] The University of Washington also beat Miami and finished with an 11–1 record, further adding to the controversy. [...] In 2008, the situation was repeated when one-loss Oklahoma was selected for the BCS Championship over one-loss Texas, which beat the Sooners during the regular season. Although not related to the title game, after the 2007 season, Kansas was chosen to go to the BCS Orange Bowl, even though they had lost to Missouri (who went to the non-BCS Cotton Bowl, despite only losing twice to Oklahoma, and being ranked higher than both Kansas and Big Ten Rose Bowl Representative Illinois, who Missouri <b>beat).</b> <b>This,</b> among other games in history, illustrates that late season losses are often more injurious than early season losses.|$|E
