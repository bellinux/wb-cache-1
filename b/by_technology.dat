Under investigation were 4 sunflower hybrids (Helianthus annuus L.) : hybrid Bacardy (an imitolerant hybrid <b>by</b> ClearField plus <b>technology),</b> hybrid Estiva (an imitolerant hybrid <b>by</b> ClearField <b>technology),</b> hybrid Sumico (a tribenuron-methyl tolerant hybrid <b>by</b> ExpessSun <b>technology)</b> and hybrid Arizona (a hybrid <b>by</b> conventional <b>technology).</b> Factor A included the years of investigation. Factor B, herbicides and tank mixtures, included 20 rates. It includes 3 variants <b>by</b> ClearField plus <b>technology,</b> 5 variants <b>by</b> ClearField <b>technology,</b> 5 variants <b>by</b> ExpessSun <b>technology</b> and 7 variants <b>by</b> conventional <b>technology.</b> All variants are on herbicide Gardoprim plus gold 500 SC (Smetolachlor + terbuthylazine) – 3. 5 l/ha, which treated after sowing before emergence of the sunflower. It is found that the highest seed yield is obtained at herbicide tank mixture Pulsar plus + Stomp aqua <b>by</b> ClearField plus <b>technology.</b> Tank mixture Listego + Dash + Sharpen <b>by</b> ClearField <b>technology</b> and Express + Trend + Select super <b>by</b> ExpressSun <b>technology</b> also lead to obtaining high seed yields. The most unstable are secondary weed infested checks <b>by</b> the fourth <b>technologies</b> for sunflower growing which are treated with soil-applied herbicide Gardoprim plus gold only. Technologically the most valuable are herbicide combination Pulsar plus + Stomp aqua and herbicide Pulsar <b>by</b> ClearField plus <b>technology,</b> tank mixtures Listego + Dash + Sharpen and Listego + Dash <b>by</b> ClearField <b>technology</b> and Express + Trend + Select super and Express + Lactofol B + Select super <b>by</b> ExpressSun <b>technology.</b> Tank mixtures of herbicides Smerch, Pendigan, Wing, Raft, Pledge and Modown with Amalgerol premium <b>by</b> conventional <b>technology</b> have low estimates due to insufficient control of some weeds in sunflower crops...|$|R

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created <b>by</b> <b>technology,</b> Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided <b>by</b> <b>technology</b> that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated {{based upon the}} estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused <b>by</b> <b>technology</b> and the effects may last {{for up to five}} million years. In turn, technology may result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMacropinocytosis is {{regulated}} by Abl kinase via an unknown mechanism. We previously demonstrated that Abl kinase activity is, itself, regulated by Abi 1 subsequent to Abl kinase phosphorylation of Abi 1 tyrosine 213 (pY 213) [1]. Here {{we show that}} blocking phosphorylation of Y 213 abrogated the ability of Abl to regulate macropinocytosis, implicating Abi 1 pY 213 as a key regulator of macropinocytosis. Results from screening the human SH 2 domain library and mapping the interaction site between Abi 1 and the p 85 regulatory domain of PI- 3 kinase, coupled with data from cells transfected with loss-of-function p 85 mutants, {{support the hypothesis that}} macropinocytosis {{is regulated}} by interactions between Abi 1 pY 213 and the C-terminal SH 2 domain of p 85 —thereby linking Abl kinase signaling to p 85 -dependent regulation of macropinocytosis.

Although the now Erie-Lackawanna Railway continued to run the Montclair Branch, it reduced service, reducing the once two-rail alignment to one lone track, and removed most of the tracks at Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair.
