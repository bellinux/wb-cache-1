40|$|Early {{results from}} three test plantings of Casuarina equisetifolia spp. equisetifolia are reported: a clonal test of 40 locally {{selected}} clones, a progeny test of 16 wind-pollinated families of local origin, and a family-in-provenance test of 100 wind-pollinated families {{which is part}} of an international provenance trial. All tests were planted in 1996 at the Regional Forest Research Centre, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, India. Height, stem straightness and axis persistence were measured in the family tests at 6 and 12 months of age. The height of the clonal test was measured at 12 months of age. Heritability estimates obtained were ca. 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 1 for height, stem straightness and axis persistence, respectively. Heritability estimates for height were reasonably consistent across the three tests; however, estimates for stem straightness and axis persistence were generally higher in the small test of locally selected families. Height and the other two traits are most probably either weakly correlated or uncorrelated, while stem straightness and axis persistence are positively correlated. Provenances spread across the range of natural- and land-race populations tested demonstrated good growth potential at Rajahmundry. However, natural provenances from Malaysia and Thailand generally showed superior growth, while the land-race populations often demonstrated superior stem straightness. Based on these results some aspects of a breeding strategy are outlined: (a) the establishment of three unrelated sublines; (b) an initial clonal test of all parents; and (c) wind-pollinated mating within clonal <b>breeding</b> <b>orchards...</b>|$|R

30|$|The stupendous and {{multifaceted}} {{applications of}} microsatellites in tree genome analysis {{are shown in}} the Figure 1. The ubiquitous nature of microsatellites in tree genome (present in nuclear, EST, mitochondria and chloroplast genome sequences) make them the most suitable DNA markers for analysis of population genetics, phylogeny and species evolution, studies on conservation and ecology and marker assisted selection/breeding (Porth and El-Kassaby [2014]). Highly informative SSR markers generate multiple alleles, thus favoring germplasm/clonal identification, genetic integrity determination during propagation and controlled <b>breeding,</b> seed <b>orchard</b> diversity, mating system and outcrossing rate analysis (Falahati-Anbaran et al. [2007]). The multilocus nature and even distribution of microsatellites over the plant genome benefit the establishment of taxonomic identity of species and phylogeny reconstruction (Ochieng et al. [2007]). Microsatellites are ideal for conservation genetics and genetic resource management because of their selectively neutral characteristics (van Zonneveld et al. [2014]) and evolutionary processes of interest to conservation geneticists (Wang et al. [2009]).|$|R

40|$|Although {{failure to}} account for spatial {{autocorrelation}} has been dramatic in some forest progeny trials, {{little attention has been}} paid to how this issue may affect selections within the trials. The effects of spatial autocorrelation of height growth on the estimation of genetic gain and on the spatial distribution of the selected trees were studied in four Pinus pinaster Ait. progeny trials that were rogued using different selection methods and intensities. When selections are based on unadjusted original values, selected trees tend to be located in the best microsites and are unlikely to be the most genetically superior. This resulted in a loss of genetic gain that varied between 10 % and 20 % and sometimes exceeded 30 %. Differences in the loss of gain among different selection methods and intensities were minor and followed no clear pattern. Selecting on the basis of a conventional model resulted in spatial patterns of the retained trees that were clearly aggregated in all cases. However, selections based on spatially adjusted data resulted in random spatial patterns, except with family selection because of the use of multiple-tree plots. Because clumping of the retained trees may seriously affect the quantity and quality of the seed crop, breeders are strongly encouraged to use appropriate spatial models for roguing <b>breeding</b> seedling <b>orchards.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Western {{white pine}} {{historically}} dominated northern Idaho’s forested landscape {{and was the}} Inland Empire’s most economically important tree. White pine blister rust, caused by the exotic fungus Cronartium ribicola, played a principal role in the decline of western white pine. The pathogen causes branch and bole cankers, which usually girdle and kill their host. Efforts to restore western white pine populations are underway. Despite gains in resistance during over 50 years of tree improvement efforts, high infection rates still challenge growth and management of rust-resistant western white pine in northern Idaho. One rust- resistance expression of particular promise in tree <b>breeding</b> <b>orchards</b> is abnormal or slow stem-canker growth. Abnormal or slow stem-canker growth also appears to occur in pole-sized (15 - 20 years old) plantations of rust resistant western white pine in northern Idaho. The extent to which outward stem canker appearance is related to internal tree tissue damage has not been previously addressed. In this study, between 2004 and 2006, blister rust-caused stem cankers were grouped into three classes of expected severity based on field assessment of exterior canker characteristics. Cankers with the most aggressive looking characteristics (those with bright orange diamond-shaped margins, heavy resinosous, and no apparent defensive reaction of the host tree) were classified as Class I cankers. Cankers that had limited or no orange margins and had mild to moderate resinosous were classified as Class II cankers. Cankers with the least aggressive looking characteristics (those with no orange margins, tree tissue swelling {{to the extent that}} the swelling made a vertical depression on the tree bole, no resinosous, and an inactive appearance) were classified as Class III cankers. Stem cankers were examined on pole-sized, rust-resistant trees in three western white pine plantations in northern Idaho. After field classification, the cankers were harvested and cross-sectioned to determine: (1) the extent to which exterior canker appearance is related to internal tree tissue damage, (2) if tree circumference just prior to canker initiation is related to tree tissue damage during the first year following canker initiation, and (3) the relative impact of different class cankers on tree growth. 	Measurements of cross-sectioned cankers indicate statistically significant differences in tree circumferential tissue damage (percent tree girdle) during years 1 through 5 following canker initiation between canker Classes I and III, and between canker Classes II and III during years 1 through 8. Difference in median percent girdle was not significant between Classes I and II. Additionally, tree circumference just prior to canker initiation and tree tissue damage during the first year following canker initiation were positively correlated; as tree size increased, first year percent girdle of host trees also increased. Finally, the ratio of circumferential tree growth post-canker initiation to growth pre-canker initiation differed significantly among trees infected with different class cankers. Differences were significant between canker Classes I and III and between Classes II and III, but not between Classes I and II. Growth ratios were smaller for trees with more aggressive appearing cankers. 	These research results will help foresters field-classify stem cankers and predict performance of infected rust-resistant western white pine. Knowing the relative tree damage and impact on tree growth of cankers with different exterior characteristics will help foresters develop silvicultural prescriptions, including prescriptions for pruning and thinning to encourage development of target stand composition and structure. Abnormal or slow-growing cankers may indicate that their host will survive longer than expected. In addition, observed differences in canker morphology and growth of infected trees may enhance tree breeders’ and geneticists’ investigations of slow canker growth mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Establishment of {{seed orchard}} {{is aimed at}} {{producing}} good quality seeds which is an important activity for <b>breeding</b> program. Seed <b>orchard</b> is also a base population, thus its genetic diversity is depending on its design and composition (provenance, family and individual tree). Selection of an individual tree in seed orchard is needed for the enhancement of retaining good-character trees. However, selection of individual tree can change the genetic diversity of seed orchard, and the degrees to which the genetic diversity will change depend on the used selection methods. In order to investigate the effects of selection methods, 4 simulations of selection methods based on height, diameter and stem performance of individual trees were used. The differences among the 4 methods were the ranking of individual trees those selected, and families and provenances those have been represented. Seedling seed orchard of Acacia mangium in Wonogiri, Central Java was used as materials. Analysis of genetic diversity was carried out using AFLP markers. Nine primer combinations were used to produce 1025 AFLP banding patterns. Among those banding patterns, only 109 were polymorphic markers. No significant effect of individual tree selection was revealed in this study. Even though the selection was done intensively, only 7. 1 % of genetic diversity was reduced. In other words, the selection activity did not reduce the genetic diversity of seed orchard significantly. The result is important for developing future tree improvement of A. mangium, including development of hybrid between A. mangium and A. auriculiformis...|$|R
40|$|Self-incompatibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} barriers adopted by many flowering plants to prevent inbreeding, thus maintaining diversity within species. The elucidation of this reproductive constraint is crucial in olive (Olea europaea L.) because it may help to improve <b>breeding</b> strategies and <b>orchard</b> management. The available literature reports that a gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system might exist in olive, even though neither cytological nor molecular data were provided. A molecular approach failed to find S-RNase (S-locus ribonuclease) and SLF (S-locus F-box containing protein), the genes responsible for GSI. In this paper, cyto-histological observations and bio-molecular evidence is presented, supporting the presence in olive of a sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) system. The main genes known to play a crucial role in SSI are SRK (S-locus receptor kinase) and SLG (S-locus glycoprotein), the female determinants, and SCR (S-locus cysteine rich protein), the male determinant. OeSLG and OeSRK genes cloned by PCR with degenerated primers were shown to be differentially expressed in flower organs of self-compatible (cv. Frantoio) and self-incompatible (cv. Leccino) genotypes by means of Real-Time PCR analysis. Since the same approach failed to isolate SCR, a 454 pyrosequencing library derived from flowers at different developmental stages was screened. One of the sequences displaying a conserved amino acid structure in terms of cysteine residuals, named OeSCR-like, proved to be specifically expressed in anthers at blooming stages. The overall data so far collected support the existence of an SSI system in olive, at least in the tested genotypes...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{genetics}} of multipurpose trees in the genus Prosopis. These studies, which examined mating systems and pollination biology of P. velutina Wooten, improved our understanding of genetic structure and gene flow in natural and artificial populations. There was no evidence for either male or female sterility, but early and later flowering trees could be functionally male and female, respectively. Pollen loads on stigmas of mature flowers were adequate for pod production, so low fruit:flower ratios in P. velutina were not attributed to inadequate pollination. Flowers were receptive to pollen prior to complete anthesis when only stigmas were exserted, a trait that will facilitate controlled pollination. Hand pollinations demonstrated that P. velutina was self-fertile. Lower pod production in selfs compared to outcrosses was attributed to genetic load. Multilocus estimates of mating systems parameters derived from data for 3 isozyme systems of 30 open-pollinated families revealed 20. 7 % selfing and 7. 1 % biparental inbreeding in mating in three natural populations. Implications of self-fertility and inbreeding were discussed in relation to breeding programs, and natural and artificial populations. Genetic subdivision was found within these populations, but not among them. This genetic structure was attributed to initial long-distance seed dispersal into grasslands by livestock, followed by short-distance seed dispersal from "nucleus" trees by livestock and wildlife. Twenty-six genera of insects foraged on the flowers. Small insects were effective pollinators of P. velutina, but nocturnal insects were not. The most efficient pollinators, based on pod production after single visits to inflorescences, were native leafcutter bees (Megachilidae), followed by Perdita spp., Apis mellifera, and Volucella spp. Insect behavior can affect plant mating systems by altering the relative amounts of selfing and outcrossing, and as pollinator guilds change through the flowering season. It was also found that individual trees can bear up to three cohorts of flowers during a growing season. These factors combine to make the mating systems of P. velutina more complicated than previously thought. Approaches for using insects in <b>breeding</b> and seed <b>orchards</b> were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The most {{important}} design criterion of mechanized device is safety; safety comprises both {{the safety of}} operator and safety of maintenance personnel. Failures and safety of harvesting platform of Tractor Mounted Hydraulic Elevator (TMHE) powered by tractor PTO was tested by Finite Element Method for the mechanical harvesting of coconut orchards using digital Ergonomic hart rate meter. The objective {{of this study was}} to study the stability of the THME by finite element method, operational safety and power requirement for the use of this elevator for coconut harvesting. Also to provide sufficient adjustment and space to account for variation in body sizes, ensure controls are situated within suitable reach and are properly marked. Approach: The Modal analysis was carried out for the whole assembly of tractor mounted hydraulic elevator by using Ansis software. The digital polar hart rate meter RS 400 TM having infrared connectivity sensor is used for recording the hart rates. The research work was conducted at, Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Kokan Krishi Vidyapeeth Dapoli. The harvesting of coconuts was performed by manual climbing labor and by tractor mounted hydraulic elevator. The technical assessments included the use of biomechanical models, vibration testing equipment, ODR, BPDS. The ergonomical evaluation results of the above study are correlates to decide the feasibility, safety and efficiency of Tractor mounted hydraulic elevator for coconut harvesting. The PTO rpm influence for the lifting and lowering of the harvesting platform was studied experimentally by using digital tachometer. Results: The better stability results with the controlled vibrations and frequency of the lifting platform and welded joints were recorded by keeping constrained boundary conditions. Ergonomically operational safe and controlled heart rates are recorded. Hence the labors can continuously do the coconut harvesting work by using the tractor mounted hydraulic elevator. The minimum PTO power is required for the coconut harvesting by using tractor mounted hydraulic elevator.

40|$|This is a scanned {{version of}} a {{published}} article. The original can be found at: [URL] To {{the best of our}} knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal employees when contributing to this work. The area devoted to pear production in the United States (U. S.) is declining due to lack of precocity and high cost of production. The U. S. pear industry currently lacks "modern" orchard systems characterized by compact trees that produce early, high yields of large, high quality fruit. Tall, shaded canopies are not economically sustainable and are at a competitive disadvantage for attracting and sustaining a labor supply. There is broad and deep consensus in the pear industry that developing size-controlling rootstocks is imperative to remain competitive nationally and globally. Currently employed rootstocks in the U. S. are Pyrus communis seedlings and clones, none of which achieve more than about a one-third size reduction, and P betulifolia seedlings. Quince (C. oblonga), used with interstems in Europe and South America, is utilized commercially (without interstems) in the U. S. only for 'Cornice' in southern Oregon and northern California. This is due primarily to a lack of cold hardiness needed in more northern production areas, a lack of graft-compatibility with the other major scion cultivars, fire blight and iron chlorosis susceptibility, and relative lack of productivity versus other rootstocks, especially in California. Current evaluative trials rely on older U. S. and imported selections, and include the NC- 140 Multistate Rootstock Research Project and several individual programs in California, New York, Oregon and Washington. A fundamental deficiency is the lack of a mature pear rootstock breeding program, despite access to the USDAARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), which holds a major worldwide collection of Pyrus and related genera. International breeding programs focus on increasing yield efficiency, but also graft compatibility, fruit quality and size, high soil pH tolerance, winter hardiness, warm climate/low chilling adaptation, drought and salt tolerance, and resistance to fire blight, pear decline, and pear scab. An intensive planning and implementation effort is needed to develop the necessary contacts, collaborations, explorations, and importation logistics to acquire the most promising clonal selections for propagation and testing. Basic research needs include effects of dwarfing rootstock on tree architecture and fruiting, the underlying mechanisms of dwarfing functional in pear, the inheritance of key traits, and selection criteria for <b>breeding.</b> Propagation and <b>orchard</b> systems have also been identified as major research needs...|$|R
