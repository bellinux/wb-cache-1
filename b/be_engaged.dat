5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest.

Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1982 {{tensions}} had risen again and the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador to London Shlomo Argov on June 3, 1982, prompted Israel to launch Operation Peace for Galilee. 69 Squadron flew 27 sorties in the preparation phase for the operation, from June 4 to the actual beginning of the invasion on June 6.

Once Israeli ground forces began pushing into Lebanon, 69 Squadron provided close air support.

This changed on June 8 when it became apparent the Syrian forces in Lebanon would have to <b>be</b> <b>engaged,</b> and that same afternoon two squadron Phantoms bombed a Syrian electronic warfare facility on Jabel Barouk.|$|E

5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly {{drawn from a}} deck of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused.|$|E

In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and <b>be</b> <b>engaged</b> in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
