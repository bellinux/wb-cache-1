5000|$|In {{order to}} {{transport}} multiple data streams {{from one place}} to another over a common transmission medium, they are multiplexed in groups of four. Because each of the four data streams is not necessarily running at the same rate, some compensation has to be introduced. Typically the multiplexer takes the data from the 4 incoming 2.048 Mbit/s data streams and feeds each into a 2.112 Mbit/s stream via a <b>buffer</b> <b>store</b> leaving a series of fixed gaps in each frame.|$|E
50|$|This scheme {{does not}} allow the {{addition}} of a stuffed bit as soon as it is required because the stuffable bit is in a fixed point in the frame so it is necessary to wait until the stuffable bit time slot. This wait results in “waiting time jitter” which can be arbitrarily low in frequency (i.e. down to zero) so cannot be entirely eliminated by the filtering effects of the phase lock loop. The worst possible stuffing ratio would be 1 frame in 2 as this gives a theoretical 0.5 bit of jitter so the stuffing ratio is carefully chosen to give theoretical minimum jitter. In a practical system however, the actual decision to stuff or not may be made by comparing the read address and write address of the input <b>buffer</b> <b>store</b> so the position in the frame when the decision is made varies and adds a second variable dependent on the length of the store.|$|E
30|$|A buffer {{family is}} a {{collection}} of circular <b>buffers</b> which <b>store</b> time series data for a single variable. The variable can either be {{in the form of a}} floating point value or a string. The former is used for performance data, resource usage and statistics while the latter is use for representing service check results, logs, events and other non numeric data. In both cases the buffer family consists of a series of buffers appropriate to that data type. The first buffer within the family is the receiving <b>buffer,</b> which <b>stores</b> metrics as they are received from monitored hosts. Subsequent buffers in the family are aggregate <b>buffers,</b> these <b>buffers</b> <b>store</b> aggregated metrics representing the value over a given time period. Each aggregate <b>buffer</b> <b>stores</b> data for a given interval with each additional <b>buffer</b> <b>storing</b> aggregate for a greater time period than the previous. The user can provide intervals, via the configuration service, for aggregate buffers on a per metric basis or provide a single default set of intervals. A typical scheme might be as follows, the receiving buffer followed by aggregate buffers with a 60 s, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min and hour long periods. Values are aggregated from one buffer to another when either a buffer is full or when by a scheduled task running which runs at the frequency of the subsequent buffer. In the eventuality that a buffer has reached its capacity but the time range of data within that buffer does not extend to the interval of the subsequent buffer an interim buffer is created with an intermediate interval. This interim buffer persists until data can be directly aggregated from one buffer to the next.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{process of}} {{migrating}} a virtual machine and its virtual storage can greatly degrade {{the performance of}} other guests and applications running on the same host, including the migrating machine itself. Through experimental evaluation, we investigate the I/O performance degradation imposed by storage migration on co-located machines.

While effective in some contexts, our analysis demonstrates that performing a migration using these I/O constraining techniques will increase migration latency and limit its ability to converge. Therefore, we present a design and analysis of Storage Migration Offloading, a migration method that reduces I/O interference, maintains lower migration latency, and converges under higher dirty rates.

The theory is then compared with other theories of hippocampal function. First, what is computed by the hippocampus is considered.

The advantage of this approach is that it operates on (potentially infinite) sets of buffer contents, rather than on individual buffer configurations.

It is thus possible to check even designs that exploit the relaxed memory model in unusual ways. An experimental implementation has been used to validate the feasibility of the approach. ...|$|R
40|$|This psychophysical theory {{involves}} the following fundamental assumptions. At a hypothetical neural decision center, signal intensity {{is represented by}} several independent, parallel Poisson processes, whose rates are the same power function of physical intensity. All decisions about signal intensity {{are based on the}} observed times between successive neural pulses. The total number of these times observed per channel is at the option of the subject, up {{to the size of a}} memory store which is emptied when a decision is made. Overall response time is the sum of the decision latency, which depends both on the signal intensity and the decision rule, and a residual latency which is only assumed to be bounded. Decision rules are suggested for discrimination, recognition, magnitude esti-mation, detection, and simple reaction time designs, and predictions are derived from the theory in these cases and compared with existing data. Various familiar generalizations, such as Weber's and Bloch's laws and the inverse relation between reaction time and intensity, derive naturally from the theory. Crude estimates of all parameters—the exponent of the power function, the number of parallel channels, the size of the <b>buffer</b> <b>store,</b> and the bound on the residual times—are provided for sound intensity; estimates from different experimental designs appear to be reasonably consistent.

40|$|Rapid {{variability}} in X-ray sources implies a compact object {{such as a}} white dwarf, neutron star or black hole. Following {{a review of the}} best known examples and their associated models, the observational history of Cygnus X- 1 is outlined. This source is generally believed to be a black hole since it appears to exhibit rapid variability (millisecond bursts) and has a mass above the theoretical neutron star limit. This thesis is concerned with an attempt to study the rapid variability of the source using a multiwire array deploying detector system with a sensitive area of 4, 000 cm 2 (1. 5 - 15 keV). The chance expectation value of millisecond bursts as seen by previous smaller experiments would be decreased from 10 - 2 to 10 - 9. The anticipated high count rate required the use of a data interactive electronics system together with a large <b>buffer</b> <b>store</b> to optimise use of the available telemetry data rate. This allowed timing of the X-ray events to 2 mS together with a large transient handling capacity so that the system was no longer severely limited at the very moment that the information was of most interest. The experiment was flown from Woomera in November 1976 and functioned correctly but the attitude control system failed providing only 6 seconds of Cygnus X- 1 data at reduced sensitivity. No other interesting observations were made while the experiment's field of view drifted across the celestial sphere. Investigations of the shot noise character of Cygnus X- 1 are not inconsistent with previous observations, but the short data set is unsuitable for such studies. A search for rapid bursts using the same analysis methods as previous workers was also inconclusive, the presence of the calibration source flux possibly being crucial in limiting the probability of a number of borderline features. The statistical interpretation of burst phenomena is discussed leading to the concept that the size of the features seen by SL- 1306 are similar numerically to those reported by Rothschild et al. (1976) and therefore represent activity at approximately one-third the intensity. Such features occurring during the non-enhanced low states would not be detected with the customary analysis by previous smaller detectors. A frequency of ~ 1 per sec is suggested for these mini bursts, the duration being 0. 5 mS, the bursts appearing to be stronger in the latter 0. 25 mS.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how electricallyheated houses can be converted to using wood pellet and solarheating. There are a large number of wood pellet stoves on themarket. Many stoves have a water jacket, which gives anopportunity to distribute the heat to domestic hot water and aradiator heating system. Three typical Swedish houses with electric resistanceheating have been studied. Fourteen different system conceptsusing wood pellet stoves and solar heating systems have beenevaluated. The systems and the houses have been simulated indetail using TRNSYS. The houses have been divided in up to 10 different zones and heat transfer by air circulation throughdoorways and open doors have been simulated. The pellet stoveswere simulated using a recently developed TRNSYS component,which models the start- and stop phases, emissions and thedynamic behaviour of the stoves. The model also calculates theCO-emissions. Simulations were made with one stove without awater jacket and two stoves with different fractions of thegenerated heat distributed in the water circuit. Simulations show that the electricity savings using a pelletstove are greatly affected by the house plan, the systemchoice, if the internal doors are open or closed and thedesired level of comfort. Installing a stove with awater-jacket connected to a radiator system and a hot waterstorage has the advantage that heat can be transferred todomestic hot water and be distributed to other rooms. Suchsystems lead to greater electricity savings, especially inhouses having a traditional layout. It was found that not allrooms needed radiators and that it was more effective in mostcases t use a stove with a higher fraction of the heatdistributed by the water circuit. The economic investigation shows that installing a woodpellet stove without a water jacket gives the lowest totalenergy- and capital costs in the house with an open plan (fortoday's energy prices and the simulated comfort criteria). Inthe houses with a traditional layout a pellet stove givesslightly higher costs than the reference house having onlyelectrical resistance heating due to the fact that less heatingcan be replaced. The concepts including stoves with a waterjacket all give higher costs than the reference system, but theconcept closest to be economical is a system with a bufferstore, a stove with a high fraction of the heat distributed bythe water circuit, a new water radiator heating system and asolar collector. Losses from stoves can be divided into: flue gas lossesincluding leakage air flow when the stove is not in operation;losses during start and stop phases; and losses due to a highair factor. An increased efficiency of the stoves is importantboth from a private economical point of view, but also from theperspective that there can be a lack of bio fuel in the nearfuture also in Sweden. From this point of view it is alsoimportant to utilize as much solar heat as possible. Theutilization of solar heat is low in the simulated systems,depending on the lack of space for a large <b>buffer</b> <b>store.</b> The simulations have shown that the annual efficiency ismuch lower that the nominal efficiency at full power. Thesimulations have also shown that changing the control principlefor the stove can improve efficiency and reduce theCO-emissions. Today's most common control principle for stovesis the on/off control, which results in many starts and stopsand thereby high CO-emissions. A more advanced control varyingthe heating rate from maximum to minimum to keep a constantroom temperature reduces the number of starts and stops andthereby the emissions. Also the efficiency can be higher withsuch a control, and the room temperature will be kept at a moreconstant temperature providing a higher comfort...|$|E
40|$|In Sweden, {{there are}} about 0. 5 million single-family houses that are heated by {{electricity}} alone, and rising electricity costs force the conversion to other heating sources such as heat pumps and wood pellet heating systems. Pellet heating systems for single-family houses are currently a strongly growing market. Future lack of wood fuels is possible even in Sweden, and combining wood pellet heating with solar heating will help to save the bio-fuel resources. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate how the electrically heated single-family houses {{can be converted to}} pellet and solar heating systems, and how the annual efficiency and solar gains can be increased in such systems. The possible reduction of CO-emissions by combining pellet heating with solar heating has also been investigated. Systems with pellet stoves (both with and without a water jacket), pellet boilers and solar heating have been simulated. Different system concepts have been compared in order to investigate the most promising solutions. Modifications in system design and control strategies have been carried out in order to increase the system efficiency and the solar gains. Possibilities for increasing the solar gains have been limited to investigation of DHW-units for hot water production and the use of hot water for heating of dishwashers and washing machines via a heat exchanger instead of electricity (heat-fed appliances). Computer models of pellet stoves, boilers, DHW-units and heat-fed appliances have been developed and the parameters for the models have been identified from measurements on real components. The conformity between the models and the measurements has been checked. The systems with wood pellet stoves have been simulated in three different multi-zone buildings, simulated in detail with heat distribution through door openings between the zones. For the other simulations, either a single-zone house model or a load file has been used. Simulations were carried out for Stockholm, Sweden, but for the simulations with heat-fed machines also for Miami, USA. The foremost result of this thesis is the increased understanding of the dynamic operation of combined pellet and solar heating systems for single-family houses. The results show that electricity savings and annual system efficiency is strongly affected by the system design and the control strategy. Large reductions in pellet consumption are possible by combining pellet boilers with solar heating (a reduction larger than the solar gains if the system is properly designed). In addition, large reductions in carbon monoxide emissions are possible. To achieve these reductions it is required that the hot water production and the connection of the radiator circuit is moved to a well insulated, solar heated <b>buffer</b> <b>store</b> so that the boiler can be turned off during the periods when the solar collectors cover the heating demand. The amount of electricity replaced using systems with pellet stoves is very dependant on the house plan, the system design, if internal doors are open or closed and the comfort requirements. Proper system design and control strategies are crucial to obtain high electricity savings and high comfort with pellet stove systems. The investigated technologies for increasing the solar gains (DHW-units and heat-fed appliances) significantly increase the solar gains, but for the heat-fed appliances the market introduction is difficult due to the limited financial savings and the need for a new heat distribution system. The applications closest to market introduction could be for communal laundries and for use in sunny climates where the dominating part of the heat can be covered by solar heating. The DHW-unit is economical but competes with the internal finned-tube heat exchanger which is the totally dominating technology for hot water preparation in solar combisystems for single-family houses.

40|$|Pulse code {{modulation}} {{is being}} introduced into telephone networks {{to increase the}} capacity of existing multi-pair cables. It is possible to use a switched digital communications network for data {{as well as for}} p. c. m. telephone traffic if all the clock oscillators in the network operate in phase at all times. Various control systems have been proposed to achieve the required clock synchronisation without the use of a central reference. These control systems are based on the application of phase locking to a large number of interconnected oscillators. Some proposals are for non-linear systems, but this Thesis is largely restricted to the discussion of linear systems. Two main types of linear system have been proposed. The first, known as the single-ended system, minimises the amount of buffer storage needed at the inputs to the exchanges. These stores allow for the variation of line delay with temperature, as well as accommodating small phase errors. The resulting network operating frequency is substantially dependent on the line delays. The alternative is the double-ended system. This eliminates the interdependence of frequency and line delay, but involves a rather more complicated stability condition. Filters, which are {{an essential part of the}} system hardware, affect the stability of both systems. Their effects are examined in the Thesis. The system equations derived in this Thesis include the line delays, the effects of hnnped filters and the starting conditions. They are obtained for both the single-and double-ended systems. A continuous model is assumed, but the systems are in fact sampled at a high rate c·. 'An alternative 'set of equations has been derived to allow the 'effects of the sampling rate to be investigated. The behaviour of the systems is examined' by means of the mathematics of multivariable control systems. This has allowed many important results to be deduced without exact knowledge of the connections between the exchanges, or even the number of exchanges. The stability criteria in this Thesis are all sufficient, but, not generally necessary. As a result, it has been possible to give the criteria in forms which may be checked at each exchange independently of the rest of the network. It is possible to add to the network without disturbing remote exchanges. The criteria are given in terms of the basic system parameters, such as gains and filter time constants. This Thesis includes a full treatment of the double-ended system, including some of the effects Q£ unbalanced gains in the error paths. The results are more comprehensive than any others published to date. and include the effects of sampling on both classes of system. The factors determining the final frequency of the synchronised network are examined. The double-ended system is treated in a general manner, which yields a formula for unbalanced systems as well as the more usual balanced system. An extreme case of this is the single-ended system. This general formula is expressed in terms of the basic system parameters, which are easily measured. It is shown that the frequency depends upon the variations of the line delays from integer multiples of one frame period, and not their absolute values. The phase comparators used in the locked oscillators are by nature periodic; a piecewise-linear form is considered to be most suitable. The periodicity causes a number of stable states to exist with different phase differences. Some of these differences may cause the <b>buffer</b> <b>store</b> capacities to be insufficient. A new set of system equations, in terms of principle phase differences, is evolved. This leads to a phase-space representation of the system state, Which has links with the method used to examine transient behaviour. Although it is not possible to give a general method for finding all the possible modes for a given network, a necessary condition for a 'wrong mode', with some large phase differences, can be found. This has suggested a technique tor the detection of such modes and their release to the desired mode with substantially zero phase dlfferences. The investigation of transients and the effects of noise is not complete. There is as yet no quantitative analysis of the noise spectrum at the lower frequencies which will affect the control system, Some indlcations of the crltical frequencies are given, to allow such measurements to be made. The investigation of transients shows that in most networks some phase differences will be increased before the network relaxes. Liapunov estimate isused, but this is limited to systems without filters or line delays. The results reported in this Thesis allow the system designer to determine the values of the controllable parameters, Some recommendations are given, and suggestions are made for the design of equipment to automatically set the network in the requlred mode of synchronised operation. A field trial of these systems is required, and proposals being studied by the British Post Office are based on results given in this Thesis. Such a trial should take place over lines carrying signals of the same statistical form as live telephone traffic. This will allow the deduction of further results concerning the transient response of the systems...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) where the users are sensor nodes powered by energy harvesters. The energy harvester has no <b>buffer</b> to <b>store</b> {{the harvested energy}} and hence the energy need to be expended immediately. We assume that the decoder has perfect knowledge of the energy harvesting process. We characterize the capacity region of such a GMAC. We also provide the capacity region {{when one of the}} users has infinite <b>buffer</b> to <b>store</b> the energy harvested. Next we find the achievable rates when the energy harvesting information is not available at the decoder...|$|R

In addition to the nodes, edges in a K-funnel <b>store</b> <b>buffers.</b> The <b>buffers</b> can be <b>stored</b> in an arbitrary order along with the recursive subtrees.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new mechanism, called Store Buffering, for {{implementing}} single-cycle store instructions in a pipelined processor. Store instructions are difficult to implement as single-cycle instructions because in most caches a tag check must be performed on the cache location before data can be stored. Store buffering allows a store instruction to check the cache tag during the cache access pipe stage and <b>buffer</b> the <b>store</b> data until the data cache is free to accept it. The data cache can accept data in the background of normal pipe execution. With multiple <b>store</b> <b>buffers</b> consecutive <b>store</b> instructions can execute without stalling the pipe. This strategy guarantees single-cycle execution without increasing the hit access time or degrading the performance of the data cache for simple direct-mapped caches, as well as for more complex set associative and write-back caches. Other single-cycle store strategies either require considerable silicon area or are limited to simple dir [...] ...|$|R
