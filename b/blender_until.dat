5000|$|In {{the recipe}} for the Brazilian pudding [...] (...) , sweet corn grains are taken raw {{together}} with milk and most often coconut milk to a <b>blender</b> <b>until</b> uniformly liquid, then cooked until it becomes thick (shredded coconut might be added in the last minutes), with cinnamon powder sprinkled at the end.|$|E
5000|$|The dish {{consists}} of raw egg yolks and sugar, beaten and ground until {{they form a}} creamy texture, with no discernible grains of sugar. In modern kitchens, it is often mixed in a <b>blender</b> <b>until</b> it changes color and becomes thick. A classic single Gogl-Mogl portion is made from two egg yolks and three teaspoons of sugar beat into a cream-like dish. Variations {{can be made by}} adding chocolate, vodka, rum, honey, vanilla, lemon juice, raisins, whipped cream, or a number of other ingredients based on one's own taste preferences. A Polish variation includes the addition of orange juice, creating a taste similar to an Orange Julius.source? ...|$|E
2500|$|The Obama Administration set {{the goal}} of {{installing}} 10,000 <b>blender</b> pumps nationwide <b>until</b> 2015. <b>Blender</b> or flexible fuel pumps simultaneously dispense E85 and other lower blends such as E50, E30 and E20 {{that can be used}} by E85 flex-fuel vehicles. On April 2011 the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issue a rule to include flexible fuel pumps [...] in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). This rule will provide financial assistance, via grants and guaranteed loans, to fuel station owners to install E85 and blender pumps.|$|R
500|$|A major {{restriction}} hampering {{sales of}} E85 flex vehicles, or fueling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 {{to the public}} with only 2% of the motor fuel stations offering E85 by March 2014. , there were only 3,218 fueling stations selling E85 {{to the public in}} the entire U.S., while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer any ethanol blend. In addition, there has been a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of [...] for each dedicated ethanol tank. The Obama Administration set the goal of installing 10,000 <b>blender</b> pumps nationwide <b>until</b> 2015, and to support this target the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a rule in May 2011 to include flexible fuel pumps in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). This ruling will provide financial assistance to fuel station owners to install E85 and blender pumps.|$|R
50|$|MoiMoi is {{prepared}} by first soaking the beans {{in cold water}} until they are soft enough to remove the fine outer covering or peel. Then they are ground or blended (using a <b>blender)</b> <b>until</b> a fine paste is achieved. Salt, bouillon cube, dried crayfish, vegetable oil (or any edible oil such as palm oil) and other seasonings are added to taste. Some add sardines, corned beef, sliced boiled eggs, {{or a combination of}} these and other 'garnishes' to liven up MoiMoi. Such is referred to as having 'x' number of lives, 'x' representing the number of garnishes added. The most touted is MoiMoi elemi meje, which translates to Moi Moi with 7 lives.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{chocolate}} bars, {{and because}} of its undissolved granulated sugar, and its rough and gritty texture, table chocolate {{is not meant to}} be eaten like a chocolate bar, although Ibarra tablets can be eaten. However, Ibarra is used primarily to make hot cocoa in traditional Mexican form. The labeling on Ibarra's packaging suggests {{that the best way to}} prepare Ibarra is to use approximately two wedges for each cup of milk or water. Heat the milk until it is near boiling, then blend the milk and chocolate in a <b>blender</b> <b>until</b> the chocolate is completely dissolved, and serve hot. Ibarra can also be prepared on the stove by dissolving the wedges in hot milk, then whisking the cocoa with a molinillo or wire whisk. In Mexico, in the traditional Aztec and Mayan form, Cayenne pepper is added to make it a spicy chocolate drink.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The prime {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop a preservation method for garlic paste that could prevent adverse quality changes and render the paste more shelf stable. Three separate batches of fresh garlic bulbs of two Sudanese varieties (Dongla and Berber) harvested in December 2011 were collected, peeled manually, separated into individual sound cloves, divided into 5 equal portions and crushed in a <b>blender</b> <b>until</b> a smooth puree was obtained. Before crushing, portions were assigned randomly to chemical treatments (T 0 - T 4). Each garlic treated portion was subdivided into 2 equal portions, packed in glass containers,, stored at 25 C or 40 C for 6 months and analyzed at an interval of 2 months. Parameters measured were, proximate composition, pH, viscosity, sugars, total soluble solids (TSS), tannic acid and carbohydrates (CHO). Berber var. had high (p 0. 05) tannins but numerically low pH than Dongola var. These two components could render Berber var. less vulnerable to spoilage than Dongola. Irrespective of storage period, Dongola var. had higher (p 0. 05) reducing and total sugars while Berber had higher (p 0. 05) non reducing sugar. Also Irrespective of the chemical treatments (T 0 - T 4) moisture, fat, ash and crude fiber contents increased (p 0. 05) while TSS, CHO and protein contents decreased (p 0. 05) with the increase of the storage period. Treatments T 0 - T 4 caused variable effects increasing (TSS and crude fiber) or decreasing (moisture) some of the parameters measured...|$|E
