40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} impact of animal production systems is due to the production of feed. Insects are suggested to efficiently convert feed to body mass and might therefore form a more sustainable food and/or feed source. Four diets were composed from by-products of food manufacturing and formulated such as to vary in protein and fat content. These were offered to newly hatched Argentinean cockroaches, <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies,</b> yellow mealworms, and house crickets. The first two species are potentially interesting as a feed ingredient, while the latter two are considered edible for humans. Feed conversion efficiency, survival, development time, as well as chemical composition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and fatty acids), were determined. The Argentinean cockroaches and the <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies</b> converted feed more efficiently than yellow mealworms, and house crickets. The first two were also more efficient than conventional production animals. On three of the four diets yellow mealworms and house crickets had a feed conversion efficiency similar to pigs. Furthermore, on the most suitable diet, they converted their feed as efficiently as poultry, when corrected for edible portion. All four species had a higher nitrogen-efficiency than conventional production animals, when corrected for edible portion. Offering carrots to yellow mealworms increased dry matter- and nitrogen-efficiency and decreased development time. Diet affected survival in all species but <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies,</b> and development time was strongly influenced in all four species. The chemical composition of Argentinean cockroaches was highly variable between diets, for <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies</b> it remained similar. The investigated species can be considered efficient production animals when suitable diets are provided. Hence, they could form a sustainable alternative to conventional production animals as a source of feed or food...|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>fly</b> larvae are edible to humans.

In 432 hours, 1 gram of <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>fly</b> eggs turns into 2.4 kilograms of protein. They thus {{can be a}} source of protein for human consumption.|$|E

The activity of larvae can keep temperatures around 37°C (100°F), while redworms require cooler temperatures. Most attempts to raise large numbers of larvae with redworms in the same container, at the same time, are unsuccessful. Worms {{have been able to}} survive in/under grub bins when the bottom is the ground. Redworms can live in grub bins when a large number of larvae are not present. Worms can be added if the larval population gets low (in the cold season) and worms can be raised in grub bins while awaiting eggs from wild <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods for}} mass-rearing <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies,</b> Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), in the {{laboratory}} are dependent on sunlight. Quartz-iodine lamps and rare earth lamps were examined as artificial light sources for stimulating H. illucens to mate and lay eggs. Sunlight {{was used as the}} control. Adults in the quartz-iodine lamp treatment had a mating rate of 61 % of those in the sunlight control. No mating occurred when the rare earth lamp was used as a substitute. Egg hatch for the quartz-iodine lamp and sunlight treatments occurred in approximately 4 days, and the hatch rate was similar between these two treatments. Larval and pupal development under these treatments required approximately 18 and 15 days at 28 ° C, respectively. Development of methods for mass rearing of H. illucens using artificial light will enable production of this fly throughout the year without investing in greenhouse space or requiring sunlight...|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} poultry {{products}} (egg and meat) is growing worldwide owing {{also to the}} absence of cultural or religious obstacles. Dietary protein sources represent the primary production costs. Soybean meal is the most used protein source in the diet formulations for broilers and laying hens. However due to its ever-increasing price, the sustainability of this production chain is becoming critical, in particular in some developing countries. Therefore, alternative feed protein sources, locally available and sustainable are required. The use of insects as an alternative source of protein in animal feeding is becoming globally more appealing, especially for its sustainability. In addition, insects (adult, larval and pupal form) are consumed naturally by wild birds and free-range poultry. The rural poultry farming in the economy and food security of developing countries has been momentous. Studies have shown the feasibility of using insects as an alternative feed source or as complementary feed source for poultry. Grasshoppers, darkling beetle, crickets, cockroaches, termites, lice, stink bugs, cicadas, aphids, scale insects, psyllids, beetles, caterpillars, flies, fleas, bees, wasps and ants have all been used as complementary food sources for poultry. Soybean or fish meal in broiler chicken or laying hen diets have been successfully replaced at low inclusion levels by <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>flies</b> (Hermetia illucens), housefly (Musca domestica), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and silkworm (Bombix mori) pupae.
