5000|$|The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> is an {{exemption}} {{in a business}} line or industry, which debars organizations in the industry from some business activities {{in order to create}} competition. The regulation is highly known in the automobile industry due to the effect caused by the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> (BER) from the European Commission. BER has changed the automobile industry in the last decade. Prior to 2003 automobile owners in the EU region risk nullifying their vehicle warranty when the vehicles were serviced or repaired in workshops not belonging to the vehicle manufacturer or its dealers. This barrier was broken in October 2003, when the European Commission (EC) passed a law allowing vehicle owners the freedom of having their servicing and repairs done at their chosen workshop.|$|E

These may also include regional or national chains and franchises including OEM car dealership sites. In the United States, these sites are commonly certified by their respective manufacturer to perform warranty and recall repairs by that manufacturer or distributor. Independent automobile repair shops in the US may also achieve certification through manufacturer sponsored programs. In the European Union a recent law (The EC <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> 1400/2002 (October 2003)) allows motorists more flexibility in selecting {{where they can get}} their car serviced. Due to this legislation, maintenance and service work {{does not have to be}} done by the main dealer as long as the garage uses Original Equipment 'Matching Quality' parts, and are recorded as such, and the garage follow the manufacturer's service schedules. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> (BER) covers service and maintenance during the warranty period and prohibits vehicle manufacturers’ warranties from including conditions that require normal maintenance to be provided within the vehicle manufacturer’s network or that all parts used must be the manufacturer’s original spare parts. This means that motorists benefit from open market competition in aftermarket parts, repairs and services thus reducing the cost of servicing through better labor rates and competitively priced parts. Also, some auto repair shops provide additional towning services.|$|E

The exemption regards the application of competition rules to certain types of agreements in the insurance sector, joint compilations, tables and studies which involve the exchange of information between insurers; and also the common coverage of risk via co-(re) insurance pools. On 17 March, the European Commission released a report focusing {{on the future of}} the Insurance <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> in which it is recommended to not renew IBER. This recommendation comes from the consideration that consumers were not receiving a fair share of the resulting benefits from the cooperation exempted by IBER and that is a Commission’s long-term strategy to eliminate industry-specific exemptions from competition law. This paper aims to investigate, under a law and economics approach, if other factors can be relevant in deciding to not provide any more exemptions for the insurance companies. After an introduction, in the following part, the economics effects of the exchange of information are analysed in terms of asymmetric information remedy and competition restrictions; then the story of the block exemption is presented and the next paragraph deals with the change in the insurance market after the end of the exemption; finally, some conclusive remarks are drawn in the light of the Big Data era...|$|E

The dissertation encapsulates three articles. The first article employs qualitative content analysis to assess whether {{and the extent to which}} the European Commission incorporates Chicago School theory into EU competition policy. It does so on the basis of current Commission Guidelines, Notices, and <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulations</b> that address EU antitrust rules and EU merger control. The second article is exploratory; it narrows the focus on EU merger control and employs descriptive network analysis to investigate the overall composition of mergers cleared by the Commission during the period 2004 – 2015 and attempts to reinforce the results of the analysis in the first article. The third article expands on the findings of the first and second articles and employs inferential network analysis with exponential random graph models to analyze, on the basis of Commission merger cases cleared during the period 2004 – 2015, whether the Harvard School, the Freiburg School, and considerations for Single Market integration underpin EU merger control, in addition to the influence of the Chicago School. The analysis presented in the articles suggests that the Chicago School has exerted considerable influence over EU competition policy. The findings further indicate that there is a strong presence of financial institutions among merger and acquisition transactions with an EU dimension in EU merger control. Finally, the findings show that the Commission appears to have a particular approach to EU competition policy that, despite being influenced by the Chicago School, cannot be explained entirely by it...|$|R

It exempts certain category of agreements, which are covered by the special regulation issued by the Council or more often by the Commission. The paper is divided into seven chapters and the first opening chapters are dealing with more general aspects of block exemption: the function, process of issuing, non- application and the advent of <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> where the <b>regulation</b> 1 / 2003 (Modernisation Regulation) should be of special attention.

40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, {{it is likely that}} the market {{definition}} approach will remain an important tool in competition policy analysis for some time, despite the increased importance of other tools such as the simulation approach. Against the background of the new <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation</b> for cars in Europe, we explore an econometric approach to define the relevant markets with differentiated products. On the one hand, the approach is directly consistent with the SSNIP-test, and it is in fact more satisfactory than previous approaches, such as critical elasticity analysis or the simple use of standard industry classifications. On the other hand, the approach shares a lot of features with the simulation approach (similar data requirements, and similar assumptions about current market power). We find that the relevant market for minivan cars is defined at the widest level, i. e. at the aggregate country level. Furthermore, in Italy the relevant markets for domestic cars are defined at an intermediate level, i. e. at the segment level. In all other cases, the relevant markets for cars may be defined at the narrowest level, i. e. at the subsegment level. Based on these results, we identify the firms that may violate the market share thresholds stipulated in the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation.</b> We find that, if we would have used an approach based on standard industry classifications instead of our econometric approach, our conclusions would have been different and, in fact, inconclusive. We also draw attention to other issues in market definition that may be of use to practitioners. competition policy; market definition...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} new Vertical <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> and {{accompanying}} Guidelines regarding their treatment of selective distribution. Further, {{it makes a}} prospective examination of the view on selective distribution in European Competition Law, especially regarding online sales. During the ten years that passed since the last Vertical <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> and accompanying Guidelines were introduced, the global market has developed in a rushing speed, much thanks to the Internet. The growing online markets have created enormous opportunities as well as problems, by shrinking the world and completely change the possibility to control markets. Therefore, the treatment of online distribution was at heart of the discussion when the old rules were to be reviewed. The main issues approached were {{the application of the}} concepts of “active” and “passive” sales on the internet {{and the ways in which}} suppliers may restrict the online behaviour of their distributors within exclusive and selective distribution systems. The review of the old rules led to an intense debate between the promoters for selective distribution systems on one side and the so called pro-internet lobby on the other. The former argued for the importance of controlling the online behaviour of appointed distributors, while the latter held that all restrictions on online sales must be individually justified and not benefit from the Block Exemption. The final result appears to be a compromise and the Commission has more than anything tried to find ways of translating the rules on offline distribution to online sales, giving wide opportunities for distributors to operate online once they have a physical point of sales. The Commission has done quite well in its ambition to clarify the rules on internet distribution even if some uncertainties remain. Whilst continuing towards a more economic approach, it has been clearly influenced with the aim for market integration, which can be seen in the tough treatment of restraints hindering parallel trade and the protection of differential price settings on markets within the European Union...|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} {{of this research}} is competition law and IPRs. Competition law regulation concerning Block Exemption concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Articles 101 and 102 mean that companies have to take into consideration certain regulation {{in order to avoid the}} intervention of competition authorities. As the system of TTBER is based on a self-announcement system, companies may take more or less risk in their agreement praxis. The research questions were: What are the preconditions for a competition according to the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) ? This research question can be divided into the following sub-questions: 1) 	How small and medium size companies (SMEs) fulfill the criteria of permitted competition after the changes in <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> concerning the Transfer of Technology? – how SMEs try to achieve market shares 2) 	How small and medium size companies fulfill the criteria of Block Exemption according the new regulation? These questions were scrutinized by litterature reviews, case analysis and updated materials from experts e. g. corporate lawyers and attorneys. The main results of the research were as follows: The doctrine of the misuse of a dominant position has often been a core issue in case law of European Court of Justice (ECJ) and especially the essential facilities problem. It has a chain effect to TTBER regulation. A dominant company can decide how to promote innovations. To identify the market shares it is important to find the relevant markets. The strength and knowledge of the licensee effects to the possibilities to succeed in license negotiations. A powerful company having the resources can take into account the TTBER regulation to favour its goals and take advantage of the economic condition. Often a high royalty is agreed in order to avoid claims. In R&D projects the amount of innovations is relevant in contract negotiations. In some cases companies have agreed of royalties in relation to the amount of the IPRs. SMEs grow into large companies and form joint ventures: it is not easy to evaluate how and when they fulfil the conditions of permitted competition. Technology pools are nowadays allowed, if they are not aiming to restrict competition and there are grounds for them, which are related to the technology. The arrangement is accepted, when it brings benefits to consumers...|$|E

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the application of}} Community principles of freedom to provide services and of free competition in international shipping lines in relation to unilateral and bilateral measures implemented by various countries to defend the interests of their flag shipping companies and in relation to agreements between shipowners (conferences, shipping consortia, strategic alliances) {{in order to reduce}} competition. With regard to the latter aspect is taken into account the question of the compatibility between agreements in liner shipping and EU antitrust rules (article 101 and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) with particular attention to liner conferences. In 1986 a <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> from the application of the European antitrust law had been justified on the assumption that liner conferences brought stability, ensuring shippers reliable services that could not be achieved by less restrictive means. The <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> had been in place for two decades. More recently a study conducted by the European Commission determined that liner conferences operating in EU trades were not producing the anticipated benefits that had justified the original <b>block</b> <b>exemption.</b> So, in 2006 the European Union decided to repeal the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> from competition law for liner shipping conferences. After a two years transition period, the repeal went into effect in October 2008. It is therefore examined the impact of the repeal of the conference <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> on the shipowners, on the shippers and in general on the international liner trades. The importance and actuality of the subject taken into account in this book are, inter alia, confirmed {{by the fact that the}} Federal Maritime Commission, in a recent study, published in 2012, compares US and EU liner trades in order to identify the effects of the UE repeal of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption...</b>|$|R

The mentioned regulation confers a benefit of the so called <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> on broad spectrum of vertical agreements including in this context also certain agreements among competing undertakings. Since agreements enjoying {{the benefit of the}} <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> are presumed to meet criteria stipulated in Article 101 (3) TFEU, the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> eliminates legal uncertainty which undertakings whose agreements distort competition within the meaning of Article 101 (1) TFEU would otherwise face.

Structure of the thesis is chosen so that it reflects three main questions concerning applicability of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption,</b> namely whether (i) an agreement falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010, whether (ii) it contains black clauses (hard-core restrictions) and whether (iii) it contains (non-severable) grey clauses.

One of the aims of this survey was to determine the average cost per patient benefiting from this regulation in comparison to total reimbursements made by the scheme and to analyse the cost distribution according to type of care and clinical diagnosis. Method: 2 % of a total sample of 67, 828 patients covered by the <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation</b> in November 1994 were randomly selected and compared to all reimbursements to patients from June to November 1994 by using the database contained in the general scheme’s information system (SIAM).

The automotive industry has its own set of competition laws regulating vertical relations, called the Motor Vehicle <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption.</b> The name meaning that the distribution of motor vehicles is exempted as a block from the general European competition policy. The regulation covers the European Economic Area, i. e. The European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The automotive industry is a large and important industry in Europe. The top manufacturers are some of the largest firms in the world and of high importance to the domestic industries. Certain aspects have for a long time characterized the distribution of cars in Norway and more generally Europe. The up-stream market is more concentrated and relative stronger than the down-stream market. A large majority of the dealers is independent retailers, i. e. not owned by the manufacturers. The brand aspects of the industry are strong; there are distinct differentiated brands with names, logos and attributes well known to most consumers. Cars {{are some of the most}} complex and important consumer products available. Many consumers are dependent on cars and if they malfunction it may have disastrous consequences. Because of the importance of the industry; The European Commission has for a long time recognized that the automotive industry requires its own set of competition rules.

The 1995 regulation had for example no rules regulating sales on the Internet. The scope for the thesis is hence to first discuss the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> compared to the old, determine the effects and then analyzing them. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> also regulates the supply of spare parts and after sale services, but my focus will entirely be on the distribution of new passenger cars. I will first discuss the main effects in a general context and then build a model to analyze them in a vertical framework. I will try to give some answers to the following questions: ·	Why do we have economic regulation in general and why does motor vehicle distribution have its own regulation? ·	Which vertical restraints were affected by changes made in the regulation with the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption?</b> ·	What are the effects normally associated with these vertical restraints? ·	How are the vertical relations between suppliers and dealers in the automotive industry affected by the regulatory changes? In Chapter 2 I will give a brief characterization of the industry. The focus will be on the main aspects, such as market concentration and demand. I will also see if the Norwegian market has any special attributes compared to the rest of Europe. Chapter 3 consists of three parts. In the first part I discuss theories explaining the existence of competition policy. The motivation for this is that it is also important to have in mind why a set of regulation exists when discussing its consequences. I will discuss vertical relations generally in the second part. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> concerns vertical relations and a general discussion of this felt necessary before discussing the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> in detail. The main part of the chapter will be a detailed discussion of the important changes in the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> compared to the old and which forms of vertical restraints that are affected. I will give a discussion of the two important vertical restraints found in Chapter 3, exclusive dealing and exclusive territories, in Chapter 4. I will discuss the important aspects that are normally associated with these vertical restraints and how different settings affect the effects of them. The main model will be found in Chapter 5. The model consists of two producers selling close substitutes and competing in prices. The idea is to observe how the possibility to use different vertical restraints affects the producers’ incentives to use independent retailers. The model is based on several existing papers analyzing vertical relations. I will show that the possibility to use two-part tariffs is necessary for vertical separation to be a dominant strategy. If franchise-fee is possible then nonexclusive dealing will remove the gain that the producers get from using independent retailers, but will not alone give the producers incentives to integrate vertically. I will also show that nonexclusive dealing only leads to lower prices if the producers may use franchise-fees. The conclusion is found in Chapter 6. Here I will sum up the effects the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> has and give some remarks on possible developments in the Norwegian market...|$|R
