5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, {{it happened at}} a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity. European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had <b>been</b> <b>seeking.</b> Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s {{the board of}} Everton have <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> a new, {{alternative}} stadium to replace Goodison Park. Plans for a possible relocation were first mentioned in 1996, when then chairman Peter Johnson announced his intention {{to build a new}} 60,000-seat stadium for the club. At the time, no English league club had a stadium with such a high capacity.|$|E
5|$|Tyndall also {{engaged in}} Holocaust denial, {{declaring that the}} Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for {{themselves}} and thus aid their plot for world domination. In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E

5|$|According to Pitchfork, {{the album}} was {{important}} for Warp, which had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> credibility after relocating their offices to New York City. Herren began acting as A member for the label, which had a reputation only for IDM, by introducing it to artists including Anti-Pop Consortium, Battles, and Flying Lotus. In 2011, after releasing The Only She Chapters, his eighth album for the label, Warp ended their relationship with Herren. The master recordings of his material stayed with the label.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} approached, Beecham {{was advised}} by his doctors {{to take a}} year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> for several years {{to get him to}} conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{responded with}} severe {{brutality}} against Bruce's allies and supporters. Bruce's sister, Mary, was suspended {{in a cage}} outside of Roxburgh for four years. Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, who had crowned Bruce, was suspended in a cage outside of Berwick Castle for four years. Bruce's younger brother Neil was executed by being hanged, drawn, and quartered; he had been captured after he and his garrison held off Edward's forces who had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> Bruce's wife (Elizabeth), daughter Marjorie, sisters Mary and Christina, and Isabella.|$|E

During interrogation, Reggie {{says he did}} not know Todd was really dead; he insists he fired a prop gun with blanks to scare Holden into {{splitting}} the money from the videos with them. Police soon learn the wadding from a blank was accidentally fired into Todd, and a horrified Reggie faces manslaughter charges. Willow, claiming to have simply <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> fame as an actress, is released without criminal charges. The episode ends with Logan and Wheeler watching a video of Larry King interviewing Willow on a giant screen in Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a difficult one. She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.|$|E

5|$|The Montalto faction {{transferred}} {{their support}} to Medici on 1 April, securing his election. Joyeuse had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> Medici's election throughout the conclave, and {{had managed to}} secure the support of Montalto for his candidate. Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested so loudly {{that he could be}} heard on the street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting the election of a candidate was useless once the person was elected pope. Upon his election, Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. His election made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese dogfish is {{too small}} and occurs too deep to pose a danger to humans. This species has long been commercially fished, using hook-and-line, gillnets, and trawls. It is mainly valued for its liver, which {{contains}} 2249% squalene by weight and is processed for vitamins. The meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, or converted into fishmeal. An important fishery for the Portuguese dogfish exists in Suruga Bay for liver oil; catches peaked during World War II, but declined soon after from over-exploitation. In the past few years, catches by the South East Trawl Fishery off Australia have been increasing, as fishers have <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> out species not covered by commercial quotas following the relaxation of seafood mercury regulations. Shark landings in this fishery are affected by a prohibition on landing livers without {{the rest of the}} carcass.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in Munich, Germany, Edward {{researches}} rocketry {{with his}} friend Alfons Heiderich, {{a young man who}} resembles Alphonse, in the hopes of returning to his world. Edward rescues a troubled, persecuted Romani woman named Noah from being sold. Noah is taken in by Edward to live with him and Alfons, and begins having visions concerning Edward's life in his world. The next day, Edward meets Fritz Lang, a Jewish film director resembling King Bradley, who persuades Edward into helping him hunt down a dragon he has <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> for inspiration for his next film. The dragon, which turns out to be homunculus Envy, attacks Edward, but is then weakened and captured by members of the Thule Society.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the guise}} of {{reinforcing}} the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807. Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas. In 1808, a popular uprising—incited by Ferdinand's supporters—saw Godoy captured and left Charles with {{no choice but to}} abdicate; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as FerdinandVII. Ferdinand had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> French patronage, but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal Joachim Murat, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive and competent than the Bourbons. They decided that Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, should be king. Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to Bayonne, France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, {{his sister}} Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{and moved to}} Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The {{following}} year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch FrederickV, who was leader of the Protestant Union, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown {{in defiance of the}} emperor {{marked the beginning of the}} turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather in the drawing room, which was the only large room in the house, and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E
5|$|The second {{campaign}} {{reveals that}} Kerrigan was not {{killed by the}} Zerg, but rather is captured and infested {{in an effort to}} incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg's cerebrates cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates Zasz, one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has <b>been</b> <b>seeking</b> for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet.|$|E
