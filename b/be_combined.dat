5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid vigour, and allows complementary traits of parents to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> to produce progeny {{better suited to}} different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|Online {{multiplayer}} {{is set up}} {{similarly to}} local multiplayer but allows the players to be at separate computers. Additionally, hotseat can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with online play, so multiple human players can use each computer.|$|E

5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea.

5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E

There are also special symbols for suprasegmental features such as stress and tone that are often employed.|$|E
5|$|DotA {{offers a}} variety of game modes, {{selected}} by the game host {{at the beginning of the}} match.

Many game modes can <b>be</b> <b>combined,</b> allowing more flexible options.|$|E
5|$|Earth usually {{requires}} {{some sort of}} processing for use in construction.

5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions.

5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E
5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain.

5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
5|$|The Platyhelminthes {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
