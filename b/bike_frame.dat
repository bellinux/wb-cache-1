25|$|Even newer designs {{have the}} bottom bracket spindle, usually hollow and larger {{diameter}} than {{is possible for}} bottom brackets with bearings held inside the bottom bracket shell of a <b>bike</b> <b>frame,</b> for reduced weight and increased stiffness, permanently attached to the right crank (Shimano and others) or the left crank (Race Face). The left crank slides onto a spline and is tightened {{with one or more}} pinch bolts (Shimano) or is pressed onto a spline by a bolt on the bottom bracket spindle (Race Face).|$|E
25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the <b>bike</b> <b>frame.</b> The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|E
2500|$|In a traditional-geometry diamond frame, the {{top tube}} is {{horizontal}} (parallel to the ground). In a compact-geometry frame, the top tube is normally sloped downward toward the seat tube for additional standover clearance. In a mountain <b>bike</b> <b>frame,</b> the top tube {{is almost always}} sloped downward toward the seat tube. [...] Radically sloped top tubes that compromise {{the integrity of the}} traditional diamond frame may require additional gusseting tubes, alternative frame construction, or different materials for equivalent strength.

The only clip-on kit engine was [...] "D" [...] series ("Д-4" ... "Д-8Э"), a single-speed chain-driven 45cc 2-stroke motor with manual clutch and a rotary slide valve in a crankschaft.
