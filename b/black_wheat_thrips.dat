The identity of this thrips species is not in doubt, but a closely similar species, Haplothrips cerealis, was described from Egypt (Priesner 1939), and subsequently recorded between southeastern Europe and Iran (see Minaei & Mound 2008). Priesner based this species on an unspecified number of specimens of both sexes, collected from the ears of cultivated wheat at “Wadi Gederât, Sinai”, and did not designate a holotype. Minaei and Mound (2010) indicated that they considered the records of cerealis from Iran to be based on misidentifications of tritici, but they suggested that further studies were required to determine if there is any evidence that these names represent different species in other countries. The problems arise because the published descriptions of, and comparisons between, the two species are confusing and sometimes contradictory. The objective of this report is to examine the published literature, and to consider this in relation to observed structural variation in recently collected samples as well as specimens in museums that are variously labeled as one or other of these two species.

The proteomes of both the germ and endosperm-bran components of Black Point-affected and Black Point-free grain were compared using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) with six replicate gels run for each protein sample. Approximately 1478 discrete protein spots were found in 2 -DE gels from the germ fraction of the grain, of which 354 were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Similarly, 1360 discrete protein spots were found from the endosperm-bran fraction, of which 303 were identified by MS. No proteins of fungal or bacterial origin were positively identified, suggesting that, at least in some cases, Black Point is not associated with microbial activity. Of the germ proteins, 252 were differentially expressed in Black Point-affected tissue, with 67 of these proteins identified by MS. Of the endosperm-bran proteins, 317 were differentially expressed in Black Point-affected tissue, with 86 identified. The largest of 12 functional classes to which the differentially abundant proteins were assigned was the ‘stress’ class, i. e. products of genes associated with stress, disease and defence. Higher levels of these proteins were found in Black Point-free grain, suggesting that protection from the disease might be afforded by increased levels of the ‘stress’ proteins. 13 page(s...|$|R

The winter cover treatments were: fallow, <b>black</b> oat, <b>wheat,</b> radish, blue lupin, and hairy vetch in conventional (plow) or no-tillage management; the summer crop was a soybean/maize rotation.

Winter crops increased soil microbial quality parameters compared to fallow in both tillage systems, with greater relative increase in conventional than no-tillage.

40|$|July 2013. A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. William H. Meyers. Vita. Russia and Ukraine (often {{referred to as the}} Black Sea region) have recently emerged as major world grain exporters. Just in the 2011 / 12 marketing year, according to the USDA (2013) they were among the top ten global suppliers of wheat (27 mln. tons), of corn (17. 2 mln. tons), and of barley (5. 8 mln. tons). The conquest of the world markets, however, did not come with a similar openness in the approach of the Ukrainian and Russian governments to policy implementation. Until recently it has still been rather dominated by frequent and rather ad hoc policy interventions in the grain markets and especially export markets. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyze the efficiency of Back Sea grain markets within the framework of price transmission models. The first essay investigates the magnitude and speed of horizontal price transmission of the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>wheat</b> and Ukrainian barley markets with world grain markets. The second essay investigates short- and long-run price transmission characteristics between world wheat prices and Ukrainian domestic wheat prices at both producer and consumer levels.
