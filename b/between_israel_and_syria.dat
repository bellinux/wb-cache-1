50|$|The work {{combined}} two projects {{dealing with}} the notion of bare life, drawn after Giorgio Agamben, and referring to the borders <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Lebanon <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> respectively. Land Without Earth focused on the unilateral transfer of fertile soil from an area under Israeli Defense Forces control in Southern Lebanon to Northern Israel in 1995-1998. While realizing a documentary movie on the subject, Ilana Salama Ortar came upon a young Druze man who had lost half his body in a landmine explosion when he was fourteen. He asked her to film him. The movie Corporeal Memory covers two time periods: the first is a journey into the past via a flashback to his childhood, the second focuses on his progress in the present. Both border areas described in the works were or are under Israeli control and experienced war. They subsist {{in a constant state of}} emergency, or State of exception.|$|R
50|$|The 1949 Armistice Agreements which {{followed}} the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, created three demilitarized zones on the Israel-Syria border. The southernmost, {{and also the}} largest, stretched from the south-eastern part of the Sea of Galilee eastwards to the Yarmuk River where the borders of <b>Israel,</b> Jordan <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> converge.

25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{conflict}} has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which peaked during the 1982 Lebanon War. The interim Oslo Accords {{led to the creation}} of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, within the context of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. The same year <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Jordan reached a peace accord. A cease-fire has been largely maintained <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Baathist <b>Syria,</b> as well as with Lebanon since 2006. However, developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah and the Syrian opposition at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel.|$|R

25|$|The 1970 peace {{agreement}} {{did not last}} long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurdish rebels, pushing them close to the border with Iran. As in the First Iraqi-Kurdish War, the Kurds received material support from Iran and Israel. Israel regarded the Iraqi military as a possible threat in case of renewed fighting <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> (during the 1973 War about one third of Iraq's army {{had been sent to}} fight against Israel on the Syrian front) and so wished to keep the Iraqis occupied elsewhere. Iran wished to strengthen its own political and military position vis-à-vis Iraq—the only other regional power in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|E
50|$|A {{casus belli}} played a {{prominent}} role during the Six-Day War of 1967. The Israeli government had {{a short list of}} , acts that it would consider provocations justifying armed retaliation. The most important was a blockade of the Straits of Tiran leading into Eilat, Israel's only port to the Red Sea, through which Israel received much of its oil. After several border incidents <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Egypt's allies <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Jordan, Egypt expelled UNEF peacekeepers from the Sinai Peninsula, established a military presence at Sharm el-Sheikh, and announced a blockade of the straits, prompting Israel to cite its casus belli in opening hostilities against Egypt.|$|R
50|$|From 4 May through 15 November 1968, VA-46 transitioned to the A-7 Corsair II. On 17 September 1970, while {{en route}} to the Caribbean for {{training}} exercises on board the USS John F. Kennedy, they received emergency orders to deploy immediately to the Mediterranean due to the hijacking of four airliners by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They remained on station off the coast of Israel until November. During October 1973, with the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War <b>between</b> <b>Israel,</b> Egypt <b>and</b> <b>Syria,</b> the Kennedy <b>and</b> her air wing, while operating in the North Atlantic after just completing a Mediterranean deployment, were ordered back to the Mediterranean. During the latter part of October through mid-November, VA-46 conducted flight operations while the carrier was on station south of Crete. On 22 November 1975 during night operations, the Kennedy collided with the USS Belknap, causing major damage to the cruiser.

500|$|The {{battlefield}} lies in {{the western}} plane of Syrian Hauran, just south-east of the Golan Heights, an upland region currently on the frontier <b>between</b> <b>Israel,</b> Jordan <b>and</b> <b>Syria,</b> east of the Sea of Galilee. The battle was fought on the plain north of Yarmouk River, which was enclosed on its western edges by a deep ravine known as Wadi-ur-Ruqqad. This ravine joins the Yarmouk River, {{a tributary of the}} Jordan River, on its south. The stream had very steep banks, ranging from – in height. On the north is the Jabiyah road and to the east are the Azra hills, although these hills were outside the actual field of battle. Strategically there was only one prominence in the battlefield: a [...] elevation known as Tel al Jumm'a, and for the Muslim troops concentrated there, the hill gave {{a good view of the}} plain of Yarmouk. The ravine on the west of the battlefield was accessible at a few places in 636 AD, and had one main crossing: a Roman bridge (Jisr-ur-Ruqqad) near Ain Dhakar Logistically, the Yarmouk plain had enough water supplies and pastures to sustain both armies. The plain was excellent for cavalry maneuvers.|$|R
25|$|The 1982 Lebanon {{war began}} on 6 June 1982, when Israel invaded {{again for the}} purpose of attacking the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Israeli army laid siege to Beirut. During the conflict, {{according}} to Lebanese sources, between 15,000–20,000 people were killed, mostly civilians. According to American military analyst Richard Gabriel, between 5,000–8,000 civilians were killed. Fighting also occurred <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria.</b> The United States, fearing a widening conflict and the prestige the siege was giving PLO leader Yasser Arafat, got all sides to agree to a cease-fire and terms for the PLO's withdrawal on 12 August. The Multinational Force in Lebanon arrived to keep the peace and ensure PLO withdrawal. The PLO leadership retreated from Beirut on 30 August 1982 and moved to Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It {{estimated}} a recovery potential of two {{million barrels of}} oil, equivalent {{at the time to}} $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria.</b> In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary approval to INOC to proceed with oil exploration drilling in the Golan. INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni. During that time, it was decided that INOC's drilling permits would be returned to the state. In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the Golan. The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded a drilling license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam.|$|E

At the end, the Syrians held Tel al-Qasr, which was part of the British Mandate of Palestine and the Jewish state according to the UN partition of 1947. Despite the above, the offensive was considered a decisive Syrian defeat by both sides. The Syrian defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati and Chief of Staff Abdullah Atfeh blamed each other, the latter resigning and the former being dismissed by the prime minister {{as a result of the}} battle. As reasons for their defeat, they gave their low level of preparedness and the strength of the Israeli defenses, as well as their lack of coordination with the Iraqis (according to one Syrian historian, the Iraqis were supposed to assist them in the Deganias). After the battle, British observers became convinced that the Arabs were not going to win the war, and compared the battle to the Luftwaffe's failure in the Battle of Britain in 1940, which showed that Germany was not going to win the air war. The observers said that [...] "A greater edge than the [...] enjoyed at Degania they won't have again".|$|E

40|$|Hydro-hegemonic praxis defines much of Israel’s {{occupation}} {{that has}} continued since {{the signing of}} the Oslo Accords in 1993. Two empirical case studies of hydro-hegemony and counter-hegemony at local level are compared in this paper: the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Both case studies show that control over water resources and supply provides political power over others at local level. Yet non-violent resistance can be observed in these border areas. In border areas <b>between</b> <b>Israel,</b> <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Palestine, control over access and water supply {{plays an important role in}} the ability of Israel to exercise hegemonic power in daily hydro-politics, which in the long term is detrimental for the people and the environment and disrupts the hydrological balance in the entire Jordan River basin...|$|R
50|$|The Kurdish {{uprising}} received {{material support}} from Iran and Israel—both of them wishing to weaken Iraq. Israel regarded the Iraqi military {{as a possible}} threat in case of renewed fighting <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Jordan <b>and</b> <b>Syria.</b> Iraqi forces {{had participated in the}} 1948 Arab invasion of <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Iraq was the only Arab participant in that war who refused to sign ceasefire agreements with Israel. Since then Iraq had {{on a number of occasions}} threatened to send forces to assist Jordan against Israel during rounds of border fighting between the two. Therefore, the Israelis wished to keep the Iraqis occupied elsewhere. Another Israeli interest was Kurdish assistance for Jews still living in Iraq to escape through Kurdish territory to Israel. Iran wished to strengthen its own political and military position vis-à-vis Iraq—the only other regional power in the Persian Gulf—and perhaps wring certain territorial concessions from Iraq in return for ceasing support of the Kurds (this was achieved in 1975, during the Second Iraqi-Kurdish War, but it is not clear when the idea was originally conceived).|$|R

2500|$|Israel {{captured}} the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. A ceasefire was signed on 11 June 1967 and the Golan Heights came under Israeli military administration.

2500|$|The {{background}} from which erupted the Six-Day War {{was caused by}} an erroneous information given to Nasser from the Soviet intelligence services that Israel was amassing troops near the Israeli-Syrian border. The state of conflict was also very tense after increased conflicts <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> and Israel and Jordan - i.e. the Samu incident. On 14 May 1967 Mohamed Fawzi (general) left for Syria for one day tour, verified that the Soviet report was false and reported {{that there were no}} Israeli armed forces near the Syrian border. Still, Nasser declared full mobilisation in Egypt as of 14 May 1967, citing the joint defence agreement with Syria. The Egyptian further steps were stationing of 100,000 Egyptian troops at the Sinai Peninsula, expulsion of UNEF peacekeeping forces (UNEF II) from the Sinai Peninsula along the border with Israel, and closure of the Straits of Tiran on May 21–22, 1967 (thus [...] "blocking all shipping to and from Eilat ... a casus belli" [...] according to a possible interpretation of international law). The Israeli army had a potential strength, including the not fully mobilized reserves, of 264,000 troops.|$|E
40|$|When {{analysing}} conflicts {{from either}} academic or policy perspectives, conflict parties are often treated as monolithic 'black boxes'. Analysis {{tends to be}} centred on relations between principal parties and third party actors both in phases of conflict and of peace. In turn, attention is often focussed on the day to day evolution of relations between conflict parties, {{at the expense of}} the underlying long-term drivers of conflict and peace, which often lie within conflict parties themselves. This is particularly true in the Middle East, where the succession of crises in the region often leaves analysts and policy-makers little time to reflect upon the structural root drivers of conflict. Stemming from this premise, this report draws out some of the main structural, interestbased and ideational domestic drivers within three conflict parties in the Middle East: <b>Israel,</b> Palestine <b>and</b> Lebanon. On the basis of this analysis, this report examines the extent and manner in which these domestic drivers have impinged upon the ensuing inter-connected conflict hubs in the region; namely the conflict <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> the Palestinians, <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> Lebanon <b>and</b> <b>Syria,</b> <b>and</b> between <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Lebanon. This report also discusses how external parties and most importantly EU actors have affected these conflicts by operating – deliberately or not – on their respective domestic drivers. In turn, we conclude by drawing out alternative policy approaches that could aid the EU pursue its oft-quoted objective to contribute and promote peace in the region...|$|R
25|$|Between 1953 and 1955 the United States Special Representative for Water in the Middle East, Eric Johnston, had {{negotiated}} the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan to jointly develop the water {{resources of the}} Jordan River Basin <b>between</b> <b>Israel,</b> Lebanon, <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Jordan. Although the Plan, known as the Johnston Plan, {{was rejected by the}} Arab League on political grounds, Jordan used it as a basis for all its future development of water resources. The Plan foresaw the construction of a dam at Maqarin on the Yarmouk River at the Jordanian-Syrian border as well as a diversion weir further downstream to divert the Yarmouk waters for irrigation of the Jordan Valley. Based on a 1953 water sharing treaty with Syria, Jordan made plans and sought funding for the dam from the United States. Israel, which diverted water from the Yarmouk to the Sea of Galilee for its own use, was not consulted, and the U.S. decided not to fund the Maqarin dam. Thus, much of the river’s winter flows drained to the Dead Sea and left insufficient water resources for the development of irrigation in Jordan. Despite this, Jordan embarked on the construction of the East Ghor Canal with U.S. funding to develop irrigation in the Northeastern Jordan Valley with the limited water it had available.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the coastal}} plain of Judea and Samaria had few water resources, Theodor Herzl already envisioned the {{transfer}} {{of water from the}} Jordan River to the coast for irrigation and drinking water supply. In 1937 the national water company Mekorot was created, more than a decade before the creation of the state of Israel. Among its achievements was the Shiloach Pipeline along the Burma Road to Jerusalem built during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and a first pipeline to the Negev in 1955. Between 1953 and 1955 the United States Special Representative for Water in the Middle East, Eric Johnston, had negotiated the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan to jointly develop the water resources of the Jordan River Basin <b>between</b> <b>Israel,</b> Lebanon, <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Jordan. The Johnston Plan was rejected by the Arab League, but Israel nevertheless abided by its water allocation under the plan. Mekorot began a Rain Enhancement program in 1961, increasing rainfall by 13–18%. A Brackish Water Pipeline to divert brackish ground water from the Sea of Galilee to the Lower Jordan was completed in 1965. The main water resources project at the time, however, was the transfer of water from the Sea of Galilee to the coast through the National Water Carrier in 1965. As a reaction to the construction of the pipeline, Lebanon, <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Jordan tried to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River. This was one of the events that increased tensions leading to the Six-Day War of 1967 during which Israel captured the West Bank and the Golan Heights.|$|R
