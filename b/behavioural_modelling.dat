40|$|<b>Behavioural</b> <b>modelling</b> of {{physical}} systems from observations of their input/output behaviour {{is an important}} task in engineering. Such models are needed for fault monitoring as well as intelligent control of these systems. The paper addresses one subtask of <b>behavioural</b> <b>modelling,</b> namely the selection of input variables {{to be used in}} predicting the behaviour of an output variable. A technique that is well suited for qualitative <b>behavioural</b> <b>modelling</b> and simulation {{of physical}} systems is Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR), a methodology based on General System Theory. Yet, the FIR modelling methodology is of exponential computational complexity, and therefore, it may be useful to consider other approaches as booster techniques for FIR. Different variable selection algorithms: the method of the unreconstructed variance for the best reconstruction, methods based on regression coefficients (OLS, PCR and PLS) and other methods as Multiple Correlation Coefficients (MCC), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Cluster analysis are discussed and compared to each other for use in predicting the behaviour of a steam generator. The different variable selection algorithms previously named are then used as booster techniques for FIR. Some of the used linear techniques {{have been found to be}} non-effective in the task of selecting variables in order to compute a posterior FIR model. Methods based on clustering seem particularly well suited for pre-selecting subsets of variables to be used in a FIR modelling and simulation effort.

40|$|A unified Bayesian {{model that}} {{simultaneously}} performs <b>behavioural</b> <b>modelling,</b> information fusion and classification is presented. The model {{is expressed in}} the form of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). <b>Behavioural</b> <b>modelling</b> is performed by tracking the continuous dynamics of a entity and incorporating various contextual elements that influence behaviour. The entity is classified according to its behaviour. Classification is expressed as a conditional probability of the entity class given its tracked trajectory and the contextual elements. Inference in the DBN is performed using a derived Gaussian sum filter. The model is applied to classify vessels, according to their behaviour, in a maritime piracy situation. The novel aspects of this work include the unified approach to behaviour modelling and classification, the way in which contextual information is fused, the unique approach to classification according to behaviour and the associated derived Gaussian sum filter inference algorithm.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research in}} developing and validating scaling in terms of geometry and frequency for <b>Behavioural</b> <b>models</b> in order to extend their functionality. Geometric and frequency scalability, {{once thought to be}} limited only to Physical and Compact models, greatly reduces the number of measurements for model generation. Besides saving precious time and effort, measurements {{do not need to be}} collected at high frequency or power levels, reducing the cost of purchasing measurement hardware. Scaling in terms of geometry is achieved by combining accurate measurement based non-linear look-up table models of a reference (smaller) transistor with the appropriate passive embedding networks. Experimental results show that the scalable model is successful in predicting the performance of devices up to 5 times larger in gate periphery on two separate Gallium Nitride wafers, one measured at 5 GHz and another at 9 GHz. This approach provides a robust utilization of <b>Behavioural</b> <b>models</b> by providing performance predictions at power levels beyond the limitations of high frequency measurement systems. The geometric scalable <b>Behavioural</b> <b>model</b> was also used in a CAD environment to help create a prototype single cell MMIC amplifier for operation at 5 GHz. Although the targeted performance was not achieved due to mismatch, the non-linear <b>Behavioural</b> <b>model</b> is still able to predict the performance of the actual fabricated circuit.

40|$|The {{agent-based}} (<b>behavioural)</b> <b>model</b> {{is extended}} {{to include a}} financial friction on the supply side. Firms finance capital purchases using external financing, but need {{to pay for it}} in advance. In addition, firm financing constraint and net worth are determined by stock market prices, which can (and will) deviate from the fundamental value. The result is that production, supply of credit and the share that firms pay to capital producers heavily depends on the stock market cycles. During phases of optimism, credit is abundant, access to production capital is easy, the cash-in-advance constraint is lax, the risks are undervalued, and production is booming. But upon reversal in market sentiment, the contraction in all these parameters is deeper and asymmetric.

40|$|The {{article is}} a {{narrative}} review of the theoretical standing and empirical evidence for the cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>model</b> of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) in general and for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in particular. A literature search of Medline and Psychinfo from 1966 {{to the present day}} was conducted using MUS and related terms as search terms. All relevant articles were reviewed. The search was then limited in stages, by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), condition, treatment and type of trial. Evidence was found for genetic, neurological, psychophysiological, immunological, personality, attentional, attributional, affective, behavioural, social and inter-personal factors in the onset and maintenance of MUS. The evidence for the contribution of individual factors, and their autopoietic interaction in MUS (as hypothesised by the cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>model)</b> is examined. The evidence from the treatment trials of cognitive behavioural therapy for MUS, CFS and IBS is reviewed as an experimental test of the cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>models.</b> We conclude that a broadly conceptualized cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>model</b> of MUS suggests a novel and plausible mechanism of symptom generation and has heuristic value.
