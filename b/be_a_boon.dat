5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} {{made its}} way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said {{tax credits}} and BNDES {{resources}} are public money and that the concession of those resources to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying that tax credits are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said tax credits are not subsidies and the stadium will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of tax credits issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit and dismissed it.|$|E

25|$|According to the U.S., Iran {{could reduce}} the world price of crude {{petroleum}} by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl). Opening Iran’s market place to foreign investment could also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to competitive U.S. multinational firms operating {{in a variety of}} manufacturing and service sectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle for}} the Tidewater Railway's {{rights-of-way}} displayed Rogers at his most crafty and ingenious. He was able to persuade the leading citizens of Roanoke and Norfolk, both strongholds of the rival Norfolk and Western, that his new railroad would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to both communities, secretly securing crucial rights-of-way in the process. In 1907, {{the name of the}} Tidewater Railway was changed to The Virginian Railway Company, and it acquired the Deepwater Railway to form the needed West Virginia-Virginia link.|$|E
25|$|Albania {{entered an}} {{orbit around the}} Soviet Union, and in September 1948 Moscow stepped in to {{compensate}} for Albania's loss of Yugoslav aid. The shift proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> for Albania because Moscow had far more to offer than hard-strapped Belgrade. The fact that the Soviet Union had no common border with Albania also appealed to the Albanian regime because it {{made it more difficult}} for Moscow to exert pressure on Tirana. In November at the First Party Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor (APL), the former Albanian Communist Party renamed at Stalin's suggestion, Hoxha pinned the blame for the country's woes on Yugoslavia and Xoxe. Hoxha had Xoxe sacked as internal affairs minister in October, replacing him with Shehu. After a secret trial in May 1949, Xoxe was executed. The subsequent anti-Titoist purges in Albania brought the liquidation of 14 members of the party's 31 person Central Committee and 32 of the 109 People's Assembly deputies. Overall, the party expelled about 25% of its membership. Yugoslavia responded with a propaganda counterattack, canceled its treaty of friendship with Albania, and in 1950 withdrew its diplomatic mission from Tirana.|$|E

25|$|In {{considering}} post-detection {{courses of}} action, {{it is also}} useful to consider the relative technological capabilities both in relation to signal relay time and in relation {{to whether or not}} the ETI is thought to pose a militaristic threat. If the ETI in question is transmitting from outside the Solar System, there will be a significant lag in time between transmission and receipt by either party. The relative sophistication of the communication technology available to each party would play heavily into the feasibility of certain types and content of messaging. In a similar vein, the potential disparities in sophistication of weapons technology hold grave implications for how humankind should react to ETI. Due to the perceived risk of revealing the precise location of the Earth to alien civilizations, METI has been heavily criticized as irresponsible considering the lack of information available about any real or potential ETI threat. Even in the likely scenario that accurate locational coordinates of Earth were available, there is question as to whether humankind should reveal anything more about itself that could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to hostile ETI. Notable among the critics of METI are British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and science fiction author David Brin.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} x86 {{architecture}} allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, {{and opens}} {{the possibility of using}} the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a dual-boot setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to switchers, since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{also learned}} much about Massachusetts' mercantile elite; while he {{initially}} considered this knowledge a curse, it {{would prove to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to his later activities in Kansas and at Harper's Ferry. The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool en masse at low prices. Initially, Brown naively trusted them, but soon {{realized that they were}} determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the Ohio Cultivator, Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools en masse at the cheap prices they had been getting from them. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years.|$|E

30|$|Inherent in {{the work}} {{produced}} by radiologists (and histopathologists) {{is the fact that}} virtually every clinical act we perform is available for re-interpretation or review at a later date.

This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to patient care, and underpins much multidisciplinary team activity. It has also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to those interested in researching radiological error and those interested in using archival data for other purposes, including litigation.|$|R
500|$|Similarly, LaMarche {{points to}} two {{other types of}} movies {{difficult}} to market to large audiences. [...] "Winter can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> to little movies with niche audiences," [...] she writes, pointing to Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, Quartet, which received a limited U.S. release in January 2013, and Struck by Lightning, released at the same time. Movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization, such as the zombie–human Romeo and Juliet retelling, Warm Bodies, or the limited-release Charlie Sheen comedy A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, are also ideal for their dump-months release time frame.|$|E

2500|$|Patronage of the Board's services, {{which had}} been {{trending}} downwards since the early 1960s, was boosted in the 1970s by several major events. First, the 1974 Commonwealth Games proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> for public transport, with an additional 1,525 services provided of which 1,195 were to or from Queen Elizabeth II Park, the main games facility. Second, the oil crises of 1973 and 1979 restricted the use of private motor vehicles leading {{to an increase in}} patronage of the buses. This effect was not, however, to last beyond the end of the [...] "car-less days" [...] programme in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|During the war, Northwestern trained 49,725 {{military}} personnel through eleven training programs.

[...] The programs included the Navy V-7 Naval Reserve Midshipman's School, V-5 Naval Aviation Preparatory Program, V-1 Accredited College Program, H-V(P) Medical and Dental Program, the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and training schools for cooks, bakers, and radio operators. The scale and importance of these programs led the Navy to cordon off the Lunt Building, Swift Hall, and Shanley Pavilion as well as taking over the dormitories and fraternities on the north campus. The Technological Institute housed training programs for the Radio School and V-12 Unit. The Army also established a signal corps training school on the Evanston campus and a civil affairs training school on the Chicago campus.|$|E
