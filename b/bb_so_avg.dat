We finally look at the coherent radiation sample so obtained and we find that, by energy conservation, it develops an exponential frequency damping corresponding to a "quasi-temperature" of order ħ/R, which is naturally related to a Hawking radiation and is suggestive of a black-hole signal at quantum level.

40|$|We study an {{extended}} B-L model, which has in its structure four neutral scalars.

The dominant annihilation process will be through s-channel exchange of a scalar in <b>bb.</b> <b>So,</b> this is also a Higgs portal dark matter model, but the Higgs decay to dark matter is suppressed and meets the constraints from invisible decays of Higgs boson.

40|$|The {{support of}} quality of service (QoS) in the Internet {{has become one of}} the most {{important}} topics within the Internet community. The introduction of the Integrated Services (IntServ) and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architectures was a major breakthrough in this direction. Enhanced by the Bandwidth Broker concept, DiffServ aims to provide QoS in the Internet through the prioritization of some IP flows over others. However, up to now the DiffServ architecture lacks a standard mechanism for the interaction between users/applications and the Bandwidth Brokers (<b>BB),</b> <b>so</b> that end-to-end QoS can be achieved. In this paper we present a distributed middleware architecture for the transparent support of QoS in the Internet. The paper focuses on bridging the gap that currently exists between applications and the network and presents the end-user application toolkit (EAT). The EAT middleware provides a framework for the presentation of network services to users, the description and selection of QoS parameters, the forwarding of reservation requests and the verification of the accredited QoS level. Through the concept of application profiles, it aims to support QoS for legacy applications, that is, commercial applications that cannot be modified to support QoS.

40|$|For some time, {{the use of}} {{rootstocks}} in viticulture is {{no longer}} considered only {{as a means of}} agronomic method to avoid the phylloxera damages (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, Fitch, 1856), but as a tool to be able to influence the physiology of the cultivars and to adapt the vine’s behavior to the different soil conditions, the climatic characteristics and the cul- tivation techniques. In particular, it is increased the need to use the rootstock as a means to control the physiological processes of the plant, being the root activity closely related to that of the canopy, by exchanging signals and metabolites. The selection of the vine rootstocks started at the end of 1800, originated {{the main part of the}} rootstocks currently used in viticulture, using V. riparia and V. berlandieri. Subsequently, through the use of other genotypes were obtained new hybrids even more complex. Currently, in Italy there are 39 varieties of vine rootstock recognized on the National Register of Grapevine Varieties. but are essentially five, those used on large surfaces: Kober 5 <b>BB,</b> <b>SO</b> 4, 140 Ru, 1103 P, 110 R. In the past, for the diffusion has had an important role the need for nurserymen, who tended to favor rootstocks with excellent performance in propagation. While today there is a greater interest to satisfy the needs of viticulture’s tech- niques also as a consequence of the changed cultivations’ conditions. In fact, we need of new rootstocks able to adapt to environmental stresses caused by climate change in progress (mainly droughts and changes in the distribution of rainfall) and/or linked to new growing environments which have restricting factors for the vines. Moreover, the need to obtain specific qualitative characteristics (polyphenols content, grapes’ acidity, etc [...] ), suggest to deepen even more the aspects that can influence the wine quality. At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the period of selection (a new rootstock from crossing takes between 20 to 25 years), which through the use of molecular markers could also be reduced by half. In this paper we provided an overview about the behavior of some rootstocks tested in Tuscany during the last years. In particular, the survey covered the vigor, the productivity, and the characteristics of grapes at maturity, including the phenolic content. The rootstocks considered were: 420 A, Kober 5 <b>BB,</b> <b>SO</b> 4, 161 - 49, 140 Ru, 1103 P, 110 R, 779 P, 775 P, 3309 C, 101. 14, Fercal, Gravesac and 41 B...|$|R
