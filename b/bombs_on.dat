5|$|Bockscar {{was used}} in 13 {{training}} and practice missions from Tinian, and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> industrial targets in Japan. On 9 August 1945, Bockscar, piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, dropped a Fat Man nuclear bomb with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT over the city of Nagasaki. About 44% {{of the city was}} destroyed; 35,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

5|$|The {{interrogation}} of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in Germany, mostly at the Auergesellschaft plant at Oranienburg, so Groves {{arranged for the}} plant to be bombed on 15 March 1945. Some 612 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Eighth Air Force dropped 1,500 tons of high explosive and 178 tons of incendiary <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> the plant.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 {{he moved}} to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he worked with George Kistiakowsky on the {{development}} of explosive lenses required to detonate the implosion-type nuclear weapon. Morrison transported the core of the Trinity test device to the test site {{in the back seat of}} a Dodge sedan. As leader of Project Alberta's pit crew he helped load the atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> board the aircraft that participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war ended, he traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the area}} to the east of the Jordan River garrisoned by the Ottoman Fourth Army, two Bristol Fighters {{reporting}} early in the day all Ottoman camps {{in the area}}, were quiet. After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here they dropped their remaining <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the lorries blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E

5|$|Morrison transported {{the core}} of the Trinity test gadget to the test site {{in the back seat of}} a Dodge sedan. He was an {{eyewitness}} to the test on July 16, 1945, and wrote a report on it. A month later, as leader of Project Alberta's pit crew, he helped load the atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> board the aircraft that participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war ended, Morrison and Robert Serber traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left-wing}} and {{counterculture}} side, the film included references to topical political matters like Kent State shootings, President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, {{and the civil}} rights movement. Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in film were two non-"college movies", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The Kentucky Fried Movie, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).|$|E
5|$|She was at Toulon {{when the}} Germans invaded Vichy France and was scuttled there on 27 November 1942 to avoid capture by the Germans. Refloated by the Italians on 1 May 1943, Commandant Teste was {{captured}} by the Germans in September 1943 and sunk again the following year by Allied <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> 18–19 August 1944. Raised again in February 1945, she was still thought to be repairable and was considered for conversion as an escort or training carrier. The proposals were eventually dropped and the ship {{was used as a}} store ship for U.S.-built equipment until sold for scrap on 15 May 1950.|$|E

5|$|Somerton {{was hit by}} four Luftwaffe <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> {{the morning}} of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The bombs were aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine {{people were killed and}} thirty seven injured. A {{memorial}} at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for possible use as the site of a new town hall.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Marines {{were able}} to deploy two M1919 Browning machine guns to provide suppressing fire on Gavutu's caves, {{allowing}} more Marines to push inland from the landing area. Seeking cover, the Marines became scattered and were quickly pinned down. Captain George Stallings—the battalion operations officer—directed Marines to begin suppressive fire with machine guns and mortars on the Japanese machine gun emplacements on Tanambogo. Shortly thereafter, American dive bombers dropped several <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> Tanambogo, diminishing some {{of the volume of}} fire from that location.|$|E
5|$|The German Luftwaffe had Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor {{aircraft}} with a {{range of}} nearly 2,000 nautical miles (3700 km - 2300 miles). After the Fall of France, these aircraft could operate from western France against British merchant ships in the Atlantic. Flying from Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport, Fw 200s of I/KG40 could reach the convoy lanes west of Britain while staying outside the range of British land-based fighters. The Royal Navy had no aircraft carriers available to provide close air cover for the convoys. The Fw 200s could shadow convoys, directing U-boat attacks on them, or drop <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> convoy ships, without opposition and to deadly effect.|$|E

5|$|The Great Artiste was a U.S. Army Air Forces Silverplate B-29 bomber (B-29-40-MO 44-27353, Victor number 89), {{assigned}} to the 393d Bomb Squadron, 509th Composite Group. The aircraft was named for its bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, in reference to his bombing talents. It flew 12 training and practice missions in which it bombed Japanese-held Pacific islands and dropped pumpkin <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> targets in Japan. It was the only aircraft to participate in both the bombing of Hiroshima and the bombing of Nagasaki, albeit as an observation aircraft on each mission.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Flying Corps's 5th Wing {{under the}} command of Lieutenant-Colonel P B Joubert de la Ferté {{stationed}} at Mustabig supported the Anzac Mounted Division. The Wing was a composite formation of the No. 14 Squadron and the Australian Flying Corps's No. 1 Squadron. It was ordered to provide close air support, long-range scouting and long-range bombing. One British and ten Australian planes had dropped a hundred <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> Magdhaba on 22 December and during the battle bombed and machine gunned the area, but targets were difficult to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} around Base 5 was {{the final}} action of the fighting in the northern sector of the island, which essentially ended in stalemate. The Australians, under pressure to limit casualties to their largely inexperienced troops, had pursued a cautious campaign and had been slow to regain the initiative in the area following the defeat at Porton Plantation. In contrast, the Japanese commander—Kato—had been skillful and aggressive. On 11 August, {{in anticipation of the}} capitulation of Japan following the dropping of two atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>on</b> Japanese cities, the order to cease offensive combat operations on Bougainville was passed to all Australian units by their commanders.|$|E
