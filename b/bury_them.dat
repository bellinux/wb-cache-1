5|$|Between 21 and 24 November 2011, 23 of the RAAF's F-111C and F-111Gs {{which had}} not been {{selected}} for preservation were buried at the Swanbank landfill site outside of Ipswich, Queensland. The RAAF had considered scrapping these aircraft, but concluded {{that it would be}} cheaper to <b>bury</b> <b>them.</b> The remaining ex-RAAF F-111s will be placed on display.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year , God's {{punishment}} struck {{the people in the}} eastern lands, in the town Ornach , and in Khastorokan, and in Sarai, and in Bezdezh, and in other towns in those lands; the mortality was great among the Bessermens, and among the Tartars, and among the Armenians and the Abkhazians, and among the Jews, and among the European foreigners, and among the Circassians, and among all who lived there, so that they could not <b>bury</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eleven of {{the twelve}} USAF {{personnel}} lost {{on the day of}} the battle were listed first as missing in action (MIA), then later as KIA/body not recovered. Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border. In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> on the rocky surface.|$|E

5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} two {{disputes}} in July 1988 and January 1989 involving the funerals of non-Muslims who had converted to Islam. The non-Muslim families {{had wanted to}} cremate the bodies according to their respective non-Islamic religious rites, but a Muslim organization applied for court orders to claim the bodies and <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> according to Islamic rites. Both these disputes were eventually settled out of court.|$|E

25|$|The tombs of {{the early}} people and their {{ancestors}} indicate that the Berbers and their forebears (the Numidians and Mauretanians) believed in an afterlife. The prehistoric people of northwest Africa buried bodies in little holes. When they realized that bodies buried in unsecured holes were dug up by wild animals, they began to <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> in deeper ones. Later, they buried the dead in caves, tumuli, tombs in rocks, mounds, {{and other types of}} tombs.|$|E
25|$|Of the men {{buried at}} Kellogg's Grove only the five {{killed in the}} second battle at the site were {{originally}} buried in the grove. Most of the graves were located at the spots where the militia men fell. During the 1880s area farmers began a movement to collect those remains and <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> at one spot with a fitting monument, {{which led to the}} 1887 erection of the current stone monument and cemetery at the site.|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} {{tasks to}} be undertaken were daunting. System wide projects {{would include the}} construction of three underground rail stations in Oakland's populated downtown area, three stations through San Francisco’s downtown beneath Market Street (later expanded to four), as well as four other underground stations {{in other parts of}} San Francisco, three subterranean stations in Berkeley (which paid more to <b>bury</b> <b>them,</b> in contrast to the stations in neighboring Oakland and El Cerrito), as well as new maintenance facilities throughout the system.|$|E

25|$|An {{excavator}} {{located in}} the immediate vicinity of the carnage at Ampatuan town was identified as the instrument that was used to dig the graves of the victims two days beforehand, and then to <b>bury</b> <b>them,</b> including the vehicles. The perpetrators were not able to complete the job when a military helicopter was spotted circling above the excavation area. The excavator, emblazoned with the name of Maguindanao Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., was later identified to belong to the Maguindanao provincial government.|$|E
25|$|The Bhotiyas have {{distinctive}} funerary traditions. Young {{children who}} die of cholera or snakebite are buried {{while others are}} cremated. There is no fixed burial ground, and no ceremonies are performed {{at the time of}} burial. The wealthy keep the ashes for lowal to several streams, while others <b>bury</b> <b>them.</b> After cremation, a stalk of kusha (grass) is fixed in the ground near a tank of water and sesamum is poured on it for ten days. This makes it a refuge for the deceased's spirit until the rites are completed.|$|E
25|$|Idyllic and {{pleasant}} as this concept was for those living upstairs, {{it was bad}} news for the servants, as the first and most obvious solution was to <b>bury</b> <b>them.</b> Nowhere is this more evident than at Castle Coole in Northern Ireland. The entire servant's quarters were put underground into cellars, lit only by windows at the bottom of grated pits. The only means of approach was through a single underground tunnel, the entrance of which was concealed by the brow of a landscaped hill some distance from the house.|$|E

25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day the local civilians were observed collecting the dead insurgents {{in order to}} <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> in accordance with Islamic custom. Four insurgents were confirmed killed, while total Taliban losses during the fighting were believed to have numbered at least 20 killed and 20 wounded, including {{a number of key}} commanders. There were no Australian casualties, and despite the intensity of the fighting no civilians were believed to have been injured. The battle witnessed some of the heaviest and most sustained fighting experienced by conventional Australian forces since the Vietnam War, with as many as 60–100 insurgents thought to have been involved.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins as}} four heroes {{are locked in}} battle with a {{powerful}} sorcerer king named Dhaos. Before he can be defeated, Dhaos uses his magic to travel several years into the future, where he is immediately met {{by one of the}} four warriors' descendants and three companions, who seal him away with two magic pendants. Twelve years later, two young men named Cress and Chester return to their village to find it razed to the ground by a dark knight named Mars, whose army kills many of it inhabitants including Cress's parents and Chester's sister. While Chester stays behind to <b>bury</b> <b>them,</b> Cress leaves to meet his uncle Olson for help, who reveals that he is being forced to work for Mars before stealing his father's pendant and locking him in jail. Quickly escaping {{with the help of a}} dying woman in a nearby cell, he meets another prisoner, a young priestess named Mint, who reveals that the woman was her mother before the two leave through the dungeon's aqueducts.|$|E

25|$|According to Pliny the Elder, human {{sacrifice}} was banned by law during the consulship of Publius Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus in 97 BCE, although {{by this time}} it was so rare that the decree was largely symbolic. The Romans also had traditions that centered around ritual murder, but which they did not consider to be sacrifice. Such practices included burying unchaste Vestal Virgins alive and drowning hermaphroditic children. These were seen as reactions to extraordinary circumstances as opposed to being part of Roman tradition. Vestal Virgins who were accused of being unchaste were put to death, and a special chamber was built to <b>bury</b> <b>them</b> alive. This aim was to please the gods and restore balance to Rome. Human sacrifices, in the form of burying individuals alive, were not uncommon during times of panic in ancient Rome. However, the burial of unchaste Vestal Virgins was also practiced in times of peace. Their chasteness was thought to be a safeguard of the city, and even in punishment the state of their bodies was preserved {{in order to maintain the}} peace.|$|E
25|$|After the {{massacre}} at Panzos, repression against the Indigenous population became increasingly ruthless and {{a pattern of}} systematic killings and acts of genocide began to emerge. Several lesser known mass killings occurred {{during the same time}} period. On 8 September 1978 the Mobile Military Police of Monteros, Esquipulas, acting on orders from local landowners César Lemus and Domingo Interiano, abducted eight campesinos from Olopa, Chiquimula. On 26 September, the Military Police returned to Olopa and seized 15 additional villagers. All were subsequently found dead from drowning and hanging. The next day, the Assistant mayor of Amatillo, Francisco Garcia, addressed himself to the Court of Olopa to report on the events and to request identification of the bodies in order to <b>bury</b> <b>them.</b> That very night Garcia was also abducted and murdered. All told, more than 100 villagers of Olopa were murdered by the Mobile Military Police in 1978, including several religious workers, 15 women and more than 40 children. The PMA were reported by peasants to murder small children in Olopa by grabbing them and breaking their backs over the knees.|$|E
25|$|Lazaret or a {{quarantine}} {{hospital is}} {{not mentioned in}} the documents, but it is safe to presume {{that it had to be}} formed during the viral outbreaks, as was usual in the time. The procedure in case of outbreaks was probably analog to the existing procedure in Buda, the capital of Hungary. Today unidentified disease ravaged Belgrade in 1730. Viral epidemic killed a lot of people. During the course of only two weeks, just the Jesuits buried 220 people and themselves lost 3 missionaries. The extremely massive plague outbreak hit the city in October 1738. As Austrian army retreated in front of the advancing Turks, numerous civilians fled to the fortress, many of them being contagious. Having so many people in a cramped space, the triage was not possible so the plague spread quickly. There are reports of the dead lying in the streets for days as there was no one to <b>bury</b> <b>them.</b> Austrian garrison was decimated and the corpses of the soldiers who died of plague were burned with their personal properties.|$|E
50|$|After posting bail, Schaefer was released. Two months later, on September 27, 1972, Schaefer abducted, tortured, {{and murdered}} Susan Place, aged 17, and Georgia Jessup, 16, and <b>buried</b> <b>them</b> on Hutchinson Island.|$|R
