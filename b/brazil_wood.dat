The moisture content, specific gravity and volumetric shrinkage were measured. The Mechanical tests were performed to evaluate the hardness, the static bending and the resistance to compression parallel to fiber direction. Preliminary results showed that Eucalytusloxophleba and Eucalyptus salmonophloia have a low dimensional stability. During the drying period, woods showed signs of collapses. On the other hand, both species were highly resistant to compression strength while they were lower on the static bending.

The sewage sludge application in Corymbia plantations is a way to apply organic fertilizer and is also a good alternative for the final disposal of this residue. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the sewage sludge use as fertilizer for the essential oil production in two different Spacing. The experiment was constituted by 4 blocks and the treatments were: i) Close spacing (1 m x 1 m) with sewage sludge + K and B; ii) Close spacing with mineral fertilization: iii) Regular spacing (3 m x 1 m) with sewage sludge + K and B; and iv) Regular spacing with mineral fertilization. When the C. citriodora plots were 12, 18, 24 and 30 months old, leaves and branches biomass and also essential oil production were quantified. It was observed that the system of close planting totalized a higher biomass, 3. 8 times more than the conventional system, providing 3 times more essential oil production (363 l ha(- 1) at the close spacing and 116 l ha(- 1) at the regular Spacing during 30 months).
