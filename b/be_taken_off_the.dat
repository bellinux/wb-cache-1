5|$|A {{different}} ad for General Motors {{featured a}} laid off assembly line robot contemplating suicide, which drew {{criticism from the}} American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air and the company's website. The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Endangered species list. The Southern right whale was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; {{it is thought that}} the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E

25|$|Drugs {{continue}} to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity.

Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware and Hudson {{was one of}} (if not) {{the longest}} {{operating}} Class I railroads in American history. While in independent operation the railroad was well managed. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, D President L.F. Loree ordered many of the railway's larger locomotives to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mainline and serviced with the sole reasoning being to keep men working so they didn't lose their jobs. Most of these engines were in excellent condition and didn't need repairs. Also, in 1939, the railroad experimented with welded rail before many other railroads.|$|E

Just as it appeared the game would end in a scoreless draw, {{at the very last}} minute of the match, Nick DeLeon broke free down the right wing and sent in a cross to Pontius, who fought off his own defender to head the ball past the keeper for a 1–0 victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{against the}} consumption of cat and dog meat was given added impetus by {{the formation of the}} Chinese Companion Animal Protection Network (CCAPN). Having expanded to more than 40 member societies, CCAPN began organizing protests against eating dog and cat meat in 2006, starting in Guangzhou and continuing in more than ten other cities following a positive response from the public. Before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, officials ordered dog meat to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> menu at its 112 official Olympic restaurants to avoid offending visitors from various nations where {{the consumption of}} dog meat is taboo.|$|E
25|$|De Robeck {{commanded}} the allied naval {{force in the}} Dardanelles during the First World War. His campaign to force the straits, launched on 18 March 1915, was nearly successful, as the Turkish land-based artillery almost ran out of ammunition: however, mines laid in the straits led {{to the loss of}} three allied battleships. The subsequent ground campaign, like the naval campaign, was ultimately a failure and the ground troops had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Gallipoli peninsula by de Robeck on the night of 8 January 1916. He went on to become Commander of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet and then Commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.|$|E

25|$|Tackle design {{began to}} improve from the 1880s. The {{introduction}} of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods {{made it possible to}} cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle - this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.|$|E
25|$|On 31 May 1958 Henry Blogg {{took part}} in an unusual rescue when she was called to aid the Sheringham {{lifeboat}} Forester's Centenary. This service began with a call at 9.50am to the Sheringham honorary secretary from the Trinity House Superintendent of Great Yarmouth requesting that a sick man <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Dudgeon Light-vessel. At 10.15am the Sheringham lifeboat Forester's Centenary was launched with a doctor on board and she reached the light-vessel by 1.10pm. The doctor went aboard the light-vessel and dispensed a sedative to the sick man and he was then strapped to a stretcher and transferred to the Forester's Centenary. The lifeboat then set off on the return journey to her station. Nine miles north east from home at around 4.40pm the Forester's Centenary was in trouble when her skew gear which drives the lifeboat's oil and water pumps broke down. Henry Blogg was called out and {{had to take the}} Sheringham lifeboat in to tow. Both boats arrived back at the Sheringham station at 7.00pm and the sick man was taken to hospital.|$|E
25|$|The action {{halted the}} German 5th Alpine Division for the {{remainder}} of the day. That afternoon though, German forces were seen moving to the south-west on the flanks of the mountains trying to encircle the Anzacs. The Anzac troops withdrew joining the columns retreating south. A short time later, the British high command authorised the evacuation of Crete, ordering a withdrawal across the White Mountains to Sfakia in the south where the troops could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island by the Royal Navy. The 2/7th subsequently took part in further rearguard actions and although it was planned to evacuate it as the last Allied unit to be withdrawn, when the evacuation of Commonwealth troops ceased on 1 June due to heavy losses at sea, the majority of the battalion was captured, having helped to delay the German advance long enough to allow 12,000 troops to be withdrawn. The battalion was later rebuilt from the small cadre that managed to avoid capture, and later fought in the Pacific against the Japanese. Later, the Germans moved to bring war crime charges due to the ferocity of the fighting, claiming that the Australians and New Zealanders had killed men who were attempting to surrender, but the claim has since been refuted.|$|E
