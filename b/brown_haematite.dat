50|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{encouraged}} quarrying of the iron ore field, {{which began in the}} middle of the 19th century and continued intermittently for the next century or so. 77,984 tons of <b>brown</b> <b>haematite</b> were quarried between 1855 and 1861 and a further 86,443 tons between 1871 and 1874. Quarrying was renewed during the Second World War and was still continuing in 1950. Seend Ironstone Quarry and Road Cutting is now a Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
50|$|The first adit {{was started}} at this iron mine in 1854, aiming to work towards Gupworthy. Little ore was found and working had ceased by 1864. Later that year the Mines Captain, Morgan Morgans, decided {{to drive a}} new adit, which proved very successful, {{yielding}} 12000 tons of <b>brown</b> <b>Haematite</b> which was taken to Langham Hill pit by an incline operated by horse powered whims. The ore was loaded on to WSMR wagons at Langham Hill. This incline was abandoned in 1866-7 when Bearland Wood mine was joined underground with Langham Hill pit.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of mining with shafts on the cliffs nearby at Trenance Point, and adits above the beach at Carnewas. The National Trust shop was originally the count house (office) of Carnewas Mine and the cafe {{was one of the}} mine buildings. Between 1871 and 1874, 940 tons of <b>brown</b> <b>haematite</b> were produced and it is thought that the ladders and steps to the beach were needed to reach the mine workings. The name Bedruthan Steps is said to be taken from a mythological giant called 'Bedruthan' who used the rocks (stacks) on the beach as stepping stones, and seems to be a late nineteenth century invention for Victorian tourists. The first written record of the name is from the West Briton newspaper in February 1847 and is likely to refer to one of two cliff staircases used by miners to get to the mine workings and now refers to the whole beach.|$|E
