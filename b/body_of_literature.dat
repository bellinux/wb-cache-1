5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – In construction, {{literature}} interorganizational {{cooperation is}} argued {{to be an}} important aspect of construction innovation. From this perspective, several distinct <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> provide relevant insights. In literature on complex product systems (CoPS), it is argued that construction industry is a CoPS industry and that in CoPS industries systems integrators set-up and coordinate interorganizational innovation. Furthermore, various <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> provide information about factors that affect the success of innovation and interorganizational cooperation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to integrate the findings from these <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature.</b> Design/methodology/approach – To uncover the present state of knowledge about systems integrators, a comprehensive literature review is conducted. Furthermore, the paper analyzes various fields <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> to derive an overview of factors which have been empirically related to the success of innovation and interorganizational cooperation. Findings – First, this paper structures the current knowledge on the role and characteristics of systems integrators. Subsequently, the paper translates this knowledge to the context of construction industry and discusses the basis for classifying a firm as a systems integrator in construction industry. Furthermore, the paper presents a list of relevant success factors derived from literature on new product development, strategic networks and alliances, open innovation, and construction innovation. Originality/value – By integrating various <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature,</b> this paper provides a solid base for future theory development on how firms achieve interorganizational innovation in construction industry...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} an interdisciplinary attempt at {{the development of}} a [...] scientific theory of norms and normativity. Normativity, understood in its most general interpretation as value determinations and prescriptions, has traditionally been troublesome to account by science and difficult to “place” within a scientific worldview. Such an accomplishment is attempted by the joining in conversation <b>of</b> two <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature.</b> The first <b>of</b> these is Steve Fuller’s naturalist epistemology and the second corresponds to the situated study of cognition, along with the epistemologies that have resulted from their findings.

Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it).

40|$|We {{propose a}} two-level-game (Putnam, 1988) {{perspective}} on gender in job negotiations. At Level 1, candidates {{negotiate with the}} employers. At Level 2, candidates negotiate with domestic partners. In order to illuminate the interplay between these two levels, we review literature from two separate <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature.</b> Research in psychology and organizational behavior on candidate-employer negotiations sheds light {{on the effects of}} gender on Level 1 negotiations. Research from economics and sociology on intra-household bargaining elucidates how negotiations over the allocation of domestic labor at Level 2 influence labor force participation at Level 1. In conclusion, we integrate practical implications from these two <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> to propose a set of prescriptive suggestions for candidates to approach job negotiations as a two-level game and to minimize disadvantageous effects of gender on job negotiation outcomes. ...|$|R
5|$|In the post-Vijayanagara era, the Kaivalya {{tradition}} branched three ways. The first {{consisted of}} {{followers of the}} Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while the third was the branch that kept the vachana tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century.

Although it lasted until 1664, its power declined after a major military defeat by the Shahi Sultanates {{in the battle of}} Talikota in 1565. The empire is named after its capital city Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround modern Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka.|$|E

Ararat is published in English by the AGBU and also includes works by Armenian writers around the world in translation.

5|$|Kannada {{features}} {{a rich and}} ancient <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as Jainism (such as Puranas), Veerashaivism (such as Vachanas), Vaishnavism (such as Haridasa Sahitya) and modern literature. Evidence from edicts {{during the time of}} Ashoka (reigned 274–232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the Kannada script and its literature. The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga, has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the native composition meters such as Chattana, Beddande and Melvadu during earlier centuries. The classic refers to several earlier greats (purvacharyar) of Kannada poetry and prose.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E

This philosophy presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions, similar to the effects of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century. The haridasas conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through esoteric Sanskrit writings (written by Vyasa kuta or Vyasa school) and simple Kannada language compositions, appealing to the common man, in the form of devotional songs (written by the Dasa Kuta or Dasa school). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa and others.|$|E
