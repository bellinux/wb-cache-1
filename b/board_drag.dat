5|$|This dilemma was {{to result}} in another costly delay for the company, as Brunel's {{negotiations}} with the Bristol Dock <b>Board</b> <b>dragged</b> on for months. It was only through {{the intervention of the}} Board of Trade that the harbour authorities finally agreed to the lock modifications, begun in late 1844.|$|R
5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{police officer}} and another employee grabbed Brown and, after a violent struggle that lasted six minutes, {{in which she was}} beaten and kicked, threw her on the <b>boarding</b> platform, <b>dragged</b> her along the platform and threatened to arrest her. She asked, [...] "What are you going to arrest me for? What have I done? Have I committed robbery? Have I murdered anybody?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics {{describe}} a man {{referred to as}} [...] "the angel" [...] {{and a woman who}} is [...] "Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain." [...] This song has a fully developed automobile theme, including some lines such as [...] "The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes/in Volkswagen vans with full running <b>boards</b> <b>dragging</b> great anchors/Followin' dead-end signs into the sores/The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore". Another notable line refers to the [...] "hubcap heaven." [...] Springsteen took one of his early rare photos in front of this site in Howell, New Jersey. The referenced [...] "Hubcap Heaven" [...] is now known as [...] "The Hubcap Farm" [...] and is still in business. Aside from an October 6, 1973 performance in Radnor, Pennsylvania, Springsteen said he would never play this song live, and he went 23 years keeping that promise. In London, on April 22, 1996, during his acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, he played the song. Until late 2009, that had only been its second live performance. However, on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York, which was the final 2009 show of his scheduled Working On A Dream Tour, he and the E Street Band performed the song, as part of the entirety of the Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. album. It was the first performance of the song with the E Street Band.|$|R
25|$|Feldman's {{first major}} test of his {{authority}} occurred in 1955, when the congregation {{moved into a}} church building. Feldman had a mechitza installed for {{the first night of}} Selichos. When they saw the tall divider separating the men's and women's sections, most of the board members' wives stormed out of the shul. The next morning, the mechitza was missing. When <b>board</b> members <b>dragged</b> their feet about reinstalling it, Feldman put his young rabbinate on the line and threatened to quit if it they didn't bring it back. On the morning before Rosh Hashana, the mechitza reappeared without comment. From that point on, the congregation acceded to its rabbi on all halakhic matters.|$|R
5000|$|Windlass {{received}} a summons {{to assist in}} refloating the grounded destroyer [...] off Fort Story. Rough weather hampered the operations which were begun on 5 January 1956, and [...] also ran aground during the attempt to pull Basilone free. Wires snapped on <b>board</b> , and Windlass <b>dragged</b> dangerously near the destroyer and the beach but managed to cut loose and steer clear. With ice on her decks and rigging, Windlass returned to Norfolk the next day.|$|R
50|$|During the Second Red Scare of {{the early}} 1950s, the United States {{government}} attempted to identify, isolate, and discredit various so-called front groups of the Communist Party. Key to this process was mandatory registration of Communist-controlled institutions with the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB). The Jefferson School initially fought this requirement, an action {{which resulted in a}} 1954 legal case, Jefferson School v. Subversive Activities Control <b>Board.</b> An appeal <b>dragged</b> on to 1963, after the dissolution of the school.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Wallace comments: [...] "I cannot say {{the game}} is {{definitively}} a classic. What I {{do know is that}} it still gets played regularly around the U.K. games scene. The vast majority of <b>board</b> games get <b>dragged</b> out once or twice and are then chucked to one side to collect dust until either auctioned or hidden in the loft by the better half. Power Grid has hung around because it has that certain something about it that makes you happy to sit down and play a game".|$|R
60|$|The Griffin did {{not remain}} {{long in the}} little field. As soon as his tail was cool he flew to the town-hall and rang the bell. The {{citizens}} {{knew that they were}} expected to come there, and although they were afraid to go, they were still more afraid to stay away; and they crowded into the hall. The Griffin was on the platform at one end, flapping his wings and walking up and down, and the end of his tail was still so warm that it slightly scorched the <b>boards</b> as he <b>dragged</b> it after him.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, the Russian public {{broadcaster}} Channel 1 aired a report claiming that Ukrainian soldiers in Sloviansk had crucified a three-year-old boy to a <b>board,</b> and later <b>dragged</b> his {{mother with a}} tank, causing her death. The account of the only witness interviewed for the report was not corroborated by anyone else, and other media {{have been unable to}} confirm the story, despite claims in the testimony that many of the city's inhabitants had been forced to watch the killings. A reporter for Novaya Gazeta similarly failed to find any other witnesses in the city.|$|R
50|$|As for the Pedrosada, the {{established}} wanton that pronounced Pedrosa and Paula Gomes and José Fernandes Gama {{members of the}} government, and due to the imperial protection {{none of them were}} to be punished. Divided and demoralized, the <b>Board</b> of Yokels <b>dragged</b> a sad resistance until December 1823 when he resigned. Faced by the opposition of the old gervasistas around the mayor of Manuel de Carvalho Andrade, Navy Parent, and Cipriano Barata, who had returned from Lisbon Cortes; and the pressures of Rio de Janeiro, which required Pernambuco monthly amounts of the king's time and further two million, equivalent to shipments to Portugal after the departure of the king.|$|R
40|$|For {{nine days}} I was chased by those accursed winds across the fish-infested seas. But on the tenth {{we made the}} country of the Lotus-eaters, a race that lived on {{vegetable}} foods. We disembarked to draw water, and my crews quickly set to on their midday meal by the ships. But {{as soon as we}} had a mouthful and a drink, I sent some of my followers inland to find out what sort of human beings might be there, detailing two men with the duty with a third as the messenger. Off they went, and it was not long before they were in touch with the Lotus-eaters. Now it never entered the heads of these natives to kill my friends; what they did was to give them some lotus to taste, and as soon as each had eaten the honeyed fruit of the plant, all thoughts of reporting to us or escaping were banished from his mind. All they wished for now was to stay where they were with the Lotus-eaters, to browse on the lotus, and to forget that they had a home to return to. I had to use force to bring them back to the ships, and they wept on the way, but once on <b>board</b> I <b>dragged</b> them under the benches and left them in irons.

50|$|Mr. Thompson {{filed suit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against both the City and the Library <b>Board.</b> The case <b>dragged</b> on through the {{remainder}} of 1950 and 1951 with numerous postponements, until Judge Sterling Hutcheson scheduled the case to be argued before a jury on July 10, 1952. On July 8, 1952, {{two days before the}} trial was to begin, {{the board of directors of}} Newport News Public Library, Inc. issued a statement: “The Board of Directors of the Newport News Public Library, Inc. has now has announced that the facilities of its main reading rooms in the library at 30th Street and West Avenue are now available to all adult inhabitants of the City of Newport News.” The Newport News Public Library was now open to African Americans and Judge Hutcheson dismissed the court case on July 18, 1952.|$|R
5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They <b>boarded</b> the streetcars, <b>dragged</b> the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Zürcher Blutgerichtsordnung" [...] (Procedures for the Blood Court in Zurich) {{dates from}} the 15th century and {{contains}} {{a detailed description of}} how the breaking on the wheel shall occur: Firstly, the delinquent is placed belly down, bound hands and feet outstretched to a <b>board,</b> and thus <b>dragged</b> by a horse to the place of execution. The wheel is then slammed two times on each arm, one blow above the elbow, the other below. Then, each leg gets the same treatment, above and below the knees. The final ninth blow is given at the middle of the spine, so that it breaks. Then, the broken body is woven onto the wheel (i.e. between the spokes), and the wheel is then hammered onto a pole, which is then fastened upright in its other end in the ground. The criminal is then to be left dying [...] "afloat" [...] on the wheel, and be left to rot.|$|R
5000|$|This {{refers to}} the {{vertical}} curve of the board between nose and tail. Rockers may be described as either heavy (steeply curved) or relaxed (less curved) and may be either continuous (a single curve between tip of nose and end of tail) or staged (distinct flat section in middle portion of board). The nose rocker or flip is the curve between the front tip and the middle or flattest portion of the board, and the tail rocker or kick is that between the tail and the middle/ flattest portion. An increase in flip helps keep the board from [...] "pearling"; larger boards often require a greater flip. A larger kick adds maneuverability and lift to the tail at speed and provides tail sensitivity in critical turns. More relaxed rockers help the board to handle better on flatter sections of water, while heavy rockers increase the <b>board's</b> overall form <b>drag</b> but also give true lift when reaching planing speed and have a smaller turning radius.|$|R
5000|$|Dungeon {{encounters}} {{are played}} out in a turn-based style. The player's turn consists of activating any skills from the monsters on their team if they are available, and then attempting to make a match (or [...] "combo") of three or more tiles (or [...] "orbs") on the board. The orbs are of the five colors representing the elemental attributes of the monsters (Fire, Wood, Water, Light, and Dark) as well as hearts that represent life recovery (certain enemy monster skills may introduce two other types of orbs to the <b>board).</b> The player <b>drags</b> an orb to adjacent positions, swapping with the orb already there. So long as the player does not {{let go of the}} orb, the player can move the orb as much as necessary within 5 seconds (unless changed by a player or enemy monsters' skills) once they start moving it, allowing them to arrange for several combos in a single turn. After completing this, all matched orbs are removed from the board and accounted for as damage. The board then cascades all orbs down and fills the board up once more; this may result in more combos, known as [...]|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the sulfur}} mustard agent found in Germany after World War II was {{dumped into the}} Baltic Sea. Between 1966 and 2002, {{fishermen}} have found about 700 chemical weapons {{in the region of}} Bornholm, most of which contain sulfur mustard. One of the more frequently dumped weapons was the [...] "Sprühbüchse 37" [...] (SprüBü37, Spray Can 37, 1937 being the year of its fielding with the German Army). These weapons contain sulfur mustard mixed with a thickener, which gives it a tar-like viscosity. When the content of the SprüBü37 comes in contact with water, only the sulfur mustard in the outer layers of the lumps of viscous mustard hydrolyzes, leaving behind amber-colored residues that still contain most of the active sulfur mustard. On mechanically breaking these lumps, e.g., with the <b>drag</b> <b>board</b> of a fishing net or by the human hand, the enclosed sulfur mustard is still as active as it had been at the time the weapon was dumped. These lumps, when washed ashore, can be mistaken for amber, which can lead to severe health problems. Artillery shells containing sulfur mustard and other toxic ammunition from World War I (as well as conventional explosives) can still be found in France and Belgium. These were formerly disposed of by explosion undersea, but since the current environmental regulations prohibit this, the French government is building an automated factory to dispose of the accumulation of chemical shells.|$|R
5000|$|Circuit Scribe {{allows users}} to create a paper Arduino (or a ‘paperduino’), which is {{demonstrated}} by the research team. The team first found the schematics on the Arduino website and modified {{them so that they}} would work on a pen plotter. With a few modifications, they arranged the components and traces so that the board could be printed in a single layer. The alignments are set to 0.6 millimeters to match the width of the pen traces with a minimum distance of 0.1 millimeters. The pen plotter only prints lines and does not fill the patterns, so they designed large pads out of concentric circles and built up the pads for the components with some extra line features. This allows for a stronger conductivity. It is important to put chips close together to minimize the line resistance between them, but not so close that it's difficult to place the components. They used components from the 1206 package which are a bit larger than the original components from the Arduino. Before exporting the layout, they deselected every layer of the file except the top layer of traces. After exporting the file in [...]dxf format, both the wire width and the fill area options were deselected and the files were saved. Finally, the team measured the size of the <b>board</b> layout and <b>dragged</b> it onto a new sheet on Silhouette Studio. From there, the vertical height was adjusted to 2.945 inches and the speed was set to 1 in order to lay down the most amount of ink when printed. The team went on to place components like resistors, capacitors, and LEDs on the printed silver ink. Components can be attached using tweezers and super glue, but can be reinforced using conductive epoxy.|$|R
