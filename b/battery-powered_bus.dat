50|$|In May 1917 a <b>battery-powered</b> <b>bus</b> entered service. A second entered {{service in}} 1920, but both were {{replaced}} with motor buses in 1924. Between January 1932 and July 1934 Derby's trams {{were replaced by}} trolleybuses. Motor buses continued to operate alongside the trolleybuses until the network began to be closed in the 1960s with the last running in September 1967.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 2000, Hong Kong Airport began {{operating}} a 16-passenger Mitsubishi Rosa electric shuttle bus, and in the fall of 2000, New York City began testing a 66-passenger <b>battery-powered</b> school <b>bus,</b> an all-electric version of the Blue Bird TC/2000. A similar bus was operated in Napa Valley, California for 14 months ending in April, 2004.|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectro-mobility is an {{increasing}} trend across the globe. In these vehicles, the passive safety has new and rather specific aspects. Some requirements for passive safety of parts of electric buses have already been {{set out in the}} UN/ECE 100. 2 regulation. The REESS (Rechargeable Energy Storage System) poses a considerable risk {{in the event of a}} collision between a <b>battery-powered</b> electric <b>bus</b> and a massive barrier. Since the testing required for the vehicle approval is very costly, one can expect computer simulations in this field to flourish. This is the task with which authors of this paper have dealt in relation to the development of SKODA battery-powered buses...|$|R
5000|$|The 1990s {{were also}} a period that the company {{explored}} the use of alternative power sources for school buses. In 1991, Blue Bird introduced the first school bus (an All American Rear Engine) powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). In 1994, Blue Bird developed a <b>battery-powered</b> school <b>bus</b> in an effort with Westinghouse Electronic Systems for a school district in California. [...] While the electric school bus remained a prototype, Blue Bird has continued to offer CNG as an option on the All American since its 1991 introduction. In 1996, the Envirobus 2000 concept made its debut; based loosely on the Q-Bus, it served as a testbed for both safety-related technology {{as well as the}} viability of compressed natural gas school buses. In 2007, Blue Bird introduced a school bus fueled by propane autogas.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2011, at {{the yearly}} {{conference of the}} National Association of Pupil Transportation, Trans Tech debuted the first factory-built <b>battery-powered</b> {{electric}} school <b>bus.</b> [...] A 42-passenger vehicle based on the Newton electric truck from Smith Electric Vehicles. With the chassis manufactured in the Bronx, New York City, the entire bus was manufactured in New York State. A set of two Lithium-ion batteries give the eTrans an approximate range of up to 130 miles between charges, taking an average of eight hours to fully recharge. This initial vehicle was never certified to operate, and the grant project [...] was later taken over by Motiv Power Systems. The Motiv Powered SSTe has been shown at shows including the Green California Summit [...] and is commercially available from TransTech.|$|R
40|$|The {{deployment}} of <b>battery-powered</b> electric <b>bus</b> systems {{within the public}} transportation sector {{plays an important role}} to increase energy efficiency and to abate emissions. Rising attention is given to bus systems using fast charging technology. This concept requires a comprehensive infrastructure to equip bus routes with charging stations. The combination of charging infrastructure and bus batteries needs a reliable energy supply to maintain a stable bus operation even under demanding conditions. An efficient layout of the charging infrastructure and an appropriate dimensioning of battery capacity are crucial to minimize the total cost of ownership and to enable an energetically feasible bus operation. In this work, the central issue of jointly optimizing the charging infrastructure and battery capacity is described by a capacitated set covering problem. A mixed-integer linear optimization model is developed to determine the minimum number and location of required charging stations for a bus network as well as the adequate battery capacity for each bus line of the network. The bus energy consumption for each route segments is determined based on individual route, bus type, traffic and other information. Different scenarios are examined in order to assess the influence of charging power, climate and changing operating conditions. The findings reveal significant differences in terms of needed infrastructure depending on the scenarios considered. Moreover, the results highlight a trade-off between battery size and charging infrastructure under different operational and infrastructure conditions. The paper addresses upcoming challenges for transport authorities during the electrification process of the bus fleets and sharpens the focus on infrastructural issues related to the fast charging concept...|$|R
