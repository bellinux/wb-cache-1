5|$|The town is the {{location}} of the town and county councils, and a number of retail complexes, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town centre, and these provide significant employment. Four in five jobs in the town are in the service industry. Within this sector, the largest employers are the administration and distribution sectors, which includes retail, food and accommodation.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E

5|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Harvey pursued {{political interests}} and spent three spells as a Member of Parliament for Maldon and later Essex. During this period {{he was also}} knighted. However, Harvey was not a peaceable man and his life <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Navy was frequently punctuated by disputes with fellow officers and politicians. One such dispute, {{a consequence of the}} Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into early retirement in 1809. Although reinstated a year later, Harvey was never again employed in an official capacity and further promotions were only bestowed as a matter of seniority.|$|E
5|$|Under Wilkes' ownership, the Spirit, which {{previously}} had covered mainly sporting events, expanded its coverage to include political matters. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Wilkes covered the battles also. He {{was present at}} the First Battle of Bull Run and wrote an account of it. He continued to serve as a correspondent throughout the war and contracted the kidney disease which he later died from during his war journalism. Wilkes also used literary feuds with other newspapers, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sporting press, to help his subscription rates. After the Civil War, Wilkes' Spirit was one of the three leading newspapers in New York City. Two, including the Spirit, of the three were mainly devoted to horse racing– the other being The Turf, Field and Farm by Sanders D. Bruce.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition {{for a period of}} time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

40|$|A {{powerful}} and useful method for heat exchanger analysis is the effectiveness-NTU method. The equations for this technique presented in textbooks, however, {{are limited to}} the case where all of the heat transfer occurs between the two fluid streams. In an application of interest to us, cryogenic heat exchangers, we wish to consider a heat leak term. Thus, we have derived equations for the {var_epsilon}-NTU method with heat leak involved.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{submicron}} Silicon spheres, whose polarizabilities are completely given by their two first Mie coefficients, {{are an excellent}} laboratory to test effects of both angle-suppressed and resonant differential scattering cross sections. Specifically, outstanding scattering angular distributions, with zero forward or backward scattered intensity, (i. e., the so-called Kerker's conditions), previously discussed for hypothetical magnetodielectric particles, are now observed for those Si objects in the near infrared. Interesting new consequences for the corresponding optical forces are derived from the interplay, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> resonance, between the electric and magnetic induced dipoles...|$|R

Employing a stylized model of international macroeconomics for large countries with imperfect competition and nominal rigidities, the closed-form solutions are derived as {{functions of the}} terms of trade (ToT). We found that, whilst both MU and Home gain from a larger MU, the gain is larger for MU because of the change in ToT by the size effect.

40|$|If Stage Three of EMU {{starts on}} 1 January 1999, {{transition}} issues remain on two time scales. Until 1 July 2002, national currencies and the euro coexist as legal tender.

Cohabitation of <b>Ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>Outs</b> has an open-ended time scale.

5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts <b>both</b> <b>IN</b> <b>and</b> <b>OUT</b> packets.|$|R
