40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the {{observed}} scale height at high altitude a calculation method has been derived for determining density scale height from the difference between two <b>satellite's</b> heights. Two <b>balloon</b> <b>satellites,</b> Chinese DQ- 1 A and DQ- 1 B, were launched together into a nearly circular orbit at a height near 900 km and they were together in orbit for 190 days. According to the difference of the orbital heights of these two <b>balloon</b> <b>satellites</b> from 19 September 1990 to 9 March 1991, 67 values of density scale height at heights of about 544 – 877 km were determined.

The first dedicated geodetic satellite was ANNA-1B, a collaborative effort between NASA, the DoD, and other civilian agencies. [...] ANNA-1B carried the first of the US Army's SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) instruments. These missions led to the accurate determination of the leading spherical harmonic coefficients of the geopotential, the general shape of the geoid, and linked the world's geodetic datums.|$|R

25|$|For over a decade, {{one aspect}} of the climate change story seemed to show a {{significant}} difference between models and observations. In the tropics, all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather <b>balloons,</b> <b>satellites,</b> and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the <b>satellite</b> and weather <b>balloon</b> data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.|$|R
