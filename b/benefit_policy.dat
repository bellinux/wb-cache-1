Justice Brennan dismissed this argument, saying that, although as an empirical matter more wives than husbands are dependent for support on their spouses, still, by automatically granting benefits to wives who might not truly be dependents, the Air Force might actually be losing money because of this policy - and the Air Force had not presented evidence to the contrary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{tools for}} a gender impact analysis of taxes and benefits. Since a full impact assessment requires examining {{not only a}} policy’s direct distributional effects on gender inequalities, but also its higher-order impacts on men’s and women’s behaviour, it must consider which inequalities and behaviours {{are relevant to the}} policies being assessed. For tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>policy,</b> the most immediate effects are on incomes, both at the individual and at the household level. However, there are equally important impacts on bargaining power and the distribution of resources within households, labor market behaviour and the long-term futures of men and women. The paper shows how tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>policy</b> can be examined for its effect on gender inequalities at each of these levels and gives examples of policies with significant impacts. It concludes with a discussion of individual vs. joint taxation and welfare spending...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact on}} inequality and poverty of the economic crisis in four European countries, namely France, Germany, the UK and Ireland, and the contribution of tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>policy</b> changes. The period examined, 2008 to 2010, was one of great economic turmoil, yet {{it is unclear whether}} changes in inequality and poverty rates over this time period were mainly driven by changes in market income distributions or by tax- <b>benefit</b> <b>policy</b> reforms. We disentangle these effects by producing counterfactual ("no reform") scenarios using tax-benefit microsimulation and representative household surveys of each country. For the period under study, we find that the policy reaction has contributed to stabilizing or even decreasing inequality and relative poverty in the UK, France and especially in Ireland, a country where rising unemployment would have otherwise increased poverty. Market income inequality has nonetheless pushed up inequality and relative poverty in France. Relative poverty and, notably, child poverty, have increased in Germany due to policy responses combined with the increasing inequality of market income...|$|E
40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{examine the effect of}} benefit misperception on tax policy making in a more general {{probabilistic}} voting framework. In a representative democracy, candidates are thought to be judged by voters on the basis of both policy and non-policy or random policy characteristics in voters’ voting decision. We include misperceived benefit levels as a random policy variable which is separate from tax policy. We suppose that taxes and benefits are separate in relation, and voters have asymmetric perception about tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>policies</b> proposed by candidates. Thus, voters may have misperception, or inaccurate perception, of the benefits from public services because of its invisibility. By employ ‘probabilistic linkage’ between tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>policies,</b> we first examine the effect of benefit misperception on tax policy making in a general probabilistic voting framework. Then, we extend our earlier paper to include the <b>benefit</b> misperception degree, <b>policy</b> salience, and tax administration costs, and examine their effects on the political opposition from taxation...|$|R

Job search behavior is unobservable, which means that voluntarily unemployed individuals can claim unemployment insurance (UI) benefits intended for unemployed workers. As a consequence, pecuniary benefit schemes underinsure workers against unemployment. We show that requiring unproductive activities (workfare) in exchange for UI benefits may generate a Pareto improvement by facilitating better unemployment insurance for workers, and we characterize the situations where this is the case.

Through a sample of 816 randomly selected residents in Beijing, the propositions are examined using logit regression analysis. The conclusions support the ideas, concerning both the positive influence of economic <b>benefits,</b> <b>policy</b> and social norms, and past experience as they affect broader electricity-saving behaviour, and the negative influence of the discomfort caused by electricity-saving activities.
