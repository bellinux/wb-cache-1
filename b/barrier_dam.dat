In 1967, {{in an effort}} to compensate for lost habitat, [...] the DWR and the California Department of Fish and Game completed the Feather River Fish Hatchery. The Fish <b>Barrier</b> <b>Dam,</b> built in 1962, intercepts salmon and trout before they reach the base of the impassable Thermalito Diversion Dam and forces them to swim up a fish ladder to the hatchery, which is located on the north bank of the Feather River. The hatchery produces 10 million salmon smolt, along with 450,000 trout smolt, to stock in the river each year. The salmon smolt are released in two runs, with 20% for the spring run and 80% for the fall run. This facility has been successful enough that there is concern that salmon of hatchery stock are out-competing remaining wild salmon in the Feather River system.|$|E

Very little of the Loe Bar shingle is locally derived (compared with nearby Gunwalloe beach material to the south) and the deposits have been tentatively dated as Eocene. The composition of the bar deposits are: chalk flint 86%, quartz 9%, grit 2.6%, greensand chert 2% and serpentine 0.5%. The shingle coming from drowned terraces of the former river that flowed down the English Channel; the nearest onshore source is 120 mi away in East Devon. Longshore drift is unlikely to have caused the formation because the bar is situated between two headlands but it plays {{an important part in}} the maintenance of the bar, with a strong current flowing to the south-east from Porthleven to Gunwalloe, depositing shingle along the bar. The ebb flow is not a simple reverse flow and is not strong enough to remove all the deposits.* ...|$|R

5000|$|Long {{after the}} Glen Canyon Dam was built and {{continuing}} to the present day, controversy remains between supporters of dam removal and those who believe it should be left in place. One of the earliest debates regarding the dam was its impact on Rainbow Bridge National Monument, whose 290 ft high natural arch is the highest in North America, and is a sacred site to the Navajo people. The environmental lobby wanted the Bureau of Reclamation to keep Lake Powell at or below a level of 3600 ft, {{to prevent it from}} intruding into the monument. The Bureau of Reclamation proposed to build a <b>barrier</b> <b>dam</b> and pump system in order to keep water out of the monument. However, with the potential damage that would be caused to the remote environment, [...] "the cure would be far worse than the disease." [...] The proposal was fought over and litigated for years until it was permanently shelved in 1973.|$|E
40|$|A key {{challenge}} in lake sturgeon restoration is their {{limited access to}} historical riverine spawning grounds, which are often upstream of <b>barriers</b> (<b>dams,</b> road‐stream crossings). The removal or modification of instream barriers can restore migratory pathways for sturgeon and other important species, but the costs (economic, species invasions) and benefits (access to breeding habitats) differ among potential projects. The restoration community lacks a transparent method for comparing these costs and benefits to assess which barrier removal projects would offer the greatest return on investment. To address this problem, we are undertaking a three‐step project {{with the goal of}} providing a decision support tool for prioritizing barriers for removal. First, we have developed the most comprehensive database to date of the location of dams (n= 7, 091) and road‐stream crossings (n= 268, 818) in the Great Lakes Basin. Second, we have created a predictive statistical model to estimate the passability of each of these potential barriers for fishes. Third, we are currently developing mathematical optimization models to determine optimal barrier removal sequences to enhance the amount of breeding habitat made available for a given budget. We will discuss the key factors that drive barrier prioritization, future data needs, and the strengths and limitations of applying optimization approaches to enhance lake sturgeon restoration efforts. ...|$|R
50|$|About halfway {{along its}} course the Old River passes by the Clifton Court Forebay, where water is pumped from the Delta to support California's two primary water supply systems, the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. Because both {{projects}} derive their sources from the Sacramento River further north, pumping {{results in a}} reverse flow in the Old River as water flowing through the Delta Cross Channel is drawn southward through the Delta and up the Old River. (Naturally, the Old River would have flowed in a northerly direction). During dry summers, this often results in saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay. The reverse flow also confuses migrating salmon in the San Joaquin River which {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the species in the 20th century. Since the 1960s, the California Department of Water Resources has maintained temporary <b>barrier</b> <b>dams</b> to control the flow of water, a system which has improved water quality and circulation. The Head of Old River barrier is routinely installed during spring at the point where the Old River diverges from the San Joaquin, in order to prevent outmigrating young salmon from entering the longer, winding Old River where they are less likely to survive the journey to the sea.|$|R
40|$|Adaptation to novel {{habitats}} and phenotypic plasticity can be counteracting forces in evolution, but both are key {{characteristics of the}} life history of steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Anadromous steelhead reproduce in freshwater river systems and small coastal streams but grow and mature in the ocean. Resident rainbow trout, either sympatric with steelhead or isolated above <b>barrier</b> <b>dams</b> or waterfalls, represent an alternative life-history form that lives entirely in freshwater. We analyzed population genetic data from 1486 anadromous and resident O. mykiss from a small stream in coastal California with multiple barrier waterfalls. Based on data from 18 highly variable microsatellite loci (He 5 0. 68), we conclude that the resident population above one barrier, Big Creek Falls, {{is the result of}} a recent anthropogenic introduction from the anadromous population of O. mykiss below the falls. Furthermore, fish from this above-barrier population occasionally descend over the falls and have established a genetically differentiated below-barrier subpopulation at the base of the falls, which appears to remain reproductively isolated from their now-sympatric anadromous ancestors. These results support a hypothesis of rapid evolution of a purely resident life history in the above-barrier population in response to strong selection against downstream movement.

40|$|Abstract. —Dams provide many {{benefits}} to society, {{yet they have}} profound impacts on aquatic ecosystems. In addition to blocking fish migration, small surface-release dams on coldwater streams generally increase water temperature below the dam. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate how small, surface-release dams affect fish communities, separating the total effect into components related to fragmentation and habitat alteration. The approach taken in this study was to synthesize results of two large studies conducted in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. The first study focused on low-head barriers (< 0. 5 m in height) built to prevent the upstream migration of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. In this study, 24 streams with sea lamprey barriers and 23 nearby reference streams without barriers were sampled. The second study evaluated 10 small hydroelectric dams. Dams that do not substantially warm downstream water temperature cause a moderate shift in fish community composition, whereas dams that warm downstream water temperature by more than 2 °C cause substantial shifts in fish community composition. The abundance of stream resident coldwater species such as brook Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta does not appear to be affected by the presence of a <b>barrier.</b> <b>Dams</b> that increase water temperature result in substantial reductions in abundance, however. These results suggest that the effect of habitat alteration caused by dams on coldwater streams should receive as much, if not greater attention, as the effect of habitat and population fragmentation...|$|R

40|$|Rivers in the Great Lakes basin {{are highly}} {{fragmented}} {{due to the}} presence of thousands of in-stream <b>barriers</b> (<b>dams</b> and road-stream crossings). The removal or modification of barriers can restore migratory pathways for river-spawning fishes, but the costs (financial, species invasions) and benefits (access to breeding habitats) differ among potential mitigation projects. We are undertaking a three-phase project with the goal of providing a transparent method for comparing these costs and benefits to assess which barrier removal projects would offer the greatest return on investment. First, we collated several existing barrier databases to create a single, comprehensive database for the Great Lakes basin. Second, we used field surveys (n= 1088 barriers) of two components of barrier passability (vertical drop, water velocity) to create a statistical model predicting probability of fish passage for each barrier in the basin. Third, we developed mathematical optimization models to determine the most efficient barrier repair/removal strategies to maximize the amount of available breeding habitat. Our database of the location of dams (n= 7, 091) and road-stream crossings (n= 268, 818) is the most comprehensive inventory to date for the GL basin. Barrier passability was positively related to upstream drainage area and negatively related to stream channel slope. Across the Great Lakes basin, spatial patterns in drainage area and slope drive several characteristic patterns in barrier passability. Barrier removal strategies generated by the optimization models are characterized by a nonlinear relationship between budget and return on investment (i. e. access to breeding habitats). We will discuss key factors that drive barrier prioritization, future data needs, and the strengths and limitations of an optimization-based approach to river restoration planning...|$|R
