5000|$|The Hood (voiced by Jess Harnell) - A {{criminal}} {{wanted for}} loan sharking, smuggling, jewel heists, and other crimes. His true identity is Lawrence Lorenzo {{who was hired}} to be the police chief. Hood and his henchmen were planning to kidnap Mayor Tilton at the Coco Bongo Club and Lt. Kellaway was appointed to head up the stakeout with his visiting mother attending. When he and his henchmen kidnap Mayor Tilton as well as Lt. Kellaway's mother, Hood reveals his identity to Mayor Tilton and states that he will dispose of him and take over Edge City. The Mask managed to find Hood's hideout in the Cornitos Chips Factory and lured every policeman there. When Hood threatens to use Mrs. Kellaway as a human shield, she manages to stomp on his foot and beat him down with her purse enough to expose Hood's identity to the other cops while Mask tricked Hood's henchmen into going into the <b>bagging</b> <b>machine.</b> Hood and his men were arrested after that.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Bag silos made {{at three}} {{research}} farms in 2000 and 2001 were monitored at filling and emptying to determine densities and losses. A total of 47 bags (23 alfalfa, 1 red clover, 23 whole−plant corn) were made, and losses were calculated on 39 of the silos. Dry matter (DM) density ranged from 160 to 270 kg/m 3. Dry matter density increased with DM content in hay crop silages on average 2. 9 kg/m 3 − % DM, whereas the effect in corn silage varied by <b>bagging</b> <b>machine.</b> Density decreased with increasing particle size at 4. 1 kg DM/m 3 per mm. The operator and the <b>bagging</b> <b>machine</b> setup both affected density. A wide range (0 % to 40 %) of DM losses was observed. Average DM losses were 9. 2 % invisible plus uncollected losses and 5. 4 % spoilage losses, {{for a total}} loss of 14. 6 %. Six silos had excessive spoilage losses of more than 15 % and total losses above 25 % due to plastic integrity issues or overly dry silage (> 40 % DM) being fed out in warm weather. Invisible losses were reduced in high−porosity silages (where spoilage losses were exacerbated), greater in warm weather, and affected by emptying procedures. Spoilage losses in bags without plastic integrity issues were greater in dry silages, from emptying silos in warm weather, at lower feed−out rates, in bags stored for a long time, and if bags were emptied periodically rather than daily...|$|E
40|$|ARIES {{consists}} of a 6 -wheeled K 3 A mobile platform, a compact subturret, a sonar imaging system, a laser-based {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) navigation beacon system, and a camera positioning system. It has a sonar imaging system used in navigation and collision avoidance and an automatic docking/charging system. Drum-referencing algorithms and camera-positioning algorithms have been included in the primitive instruction set for the robot. The robot`s navigation is based on Synchro-Drive, a patented design that utilizes concentric shafts to distribute drive and steering power to the six wheels simultaneously. ARIES uses a virtual path concept in which only a limited amount of information needs to be provided to the control computer {{in order to get the}} vehicle moving. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, found several areas of concern including ergonomics, laser hazards, tripping hazards, fall-from-above and struck-by hazards, electrical hazards, and decontamination of the system. BOA is a self-propelled automated mini-enclosure, able to remove insulation from installed pipes, primarily of 4 inch nominal outside diameter. The system is designed for two operators: one oversees the abatement head operation from a distance of 10 or 15 feet using a pendant control and the other bags the debris at a cyclonic bagging station that is attached by a vacuum hose to the cutting head. Since the abatement head is its own enclosure, there may be no need for further enclosures to be built. The system wets and removes asbestos insulation automatically, cutting the debris into consistent chunks and moving the wave under a strong vacuum to a <b>bagging</b> <b>machine.</b> Prior to reaching the bagging operation, the material passes through a water separator which greatly reduces the weight of the debris and allows recirculation of water, after sufficient filtration. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, focused on: noise, dust concentrations, ergonomics, and computer software. Industrial hygiene sampling indicated that worker exposures may be kept low enough during normal operation of BOA to eliminate the need for respiratory or heating protection while working around the cutting head and bagging operation. Airborne particulate measurements showed a slight rise over background levels during the operation of BOA, but the average of all the readings during operation was 1. 6 % of the OSHA respirable dust standard. Air sampling and noise monitoring showed dust to be negligible. Noise was shown to be a potential exposure hazard depending on worker location...|$|E

40|$|Companies {{can lose}} a {{substantial}} portion of their revenues due to deterioration in value of their products as a result of processing impediments, which might occur in the entire supply chain. Sometimes, the reasons for a decline in product quality are not fully understood, and thus there are no appropriate measures taken to prevent it. Yet, it is vital to comprehend what is actually happening during production and material handling so that proper, well-informed decisions can be made. This project deals with one of the unexplored problems [...] quality loss due to product cross-contamination, which is a common occurrence in material handling, multi-product plants. It is a process of mixing product going through multi-purpose equipment and piping with leftover residue that is currently there, which takes place when there is no intermediate cleaning in between two consecutive products, though the precise character of it is usually not known. Omitting cleaning runs to save production time and money is a common practice in the industry. This research introduces a novel simulation method to quantify and predict the extent of cross-contamination as well as to assess its effects. Many models for material handling in multi-product plant {{have been made in the}} past but very few relate to the issue of cross-contamination, which is of extreme importance in quality assurance and informed decision-making. As no similar models have been developed previously, or other research done based on a real industrial setting, it is a truly innovative study, intended to establish foundation for further research, and to raise awareness of the issue by starting to fill a gap of knowledge about what can happen during material processing. Initially, a thorough literature research is done, dealing with issues of trade-offs in manufacturing, cross-contamination in production, as well as how to combine scheduling methodologies with a powder mixing model in a discrete event simulation (DES). Then modelling boundaries and assumptions are established together with a conceptual model. Based on that, a general DES building blocks [...] class models for a <b>bagging</b> <b>machine,</b> conveyor, mixer, silo as well as product batches and orders are created. Specific analysis is performed in Sloten, a young animal feed plant in Deventer, the Netherlands, in order to find a more precise character of cross-contamination over time, as well as to test the model application in a realistic setting. Contamination measurements using tracer [...] collector method over material flow with multiple intermediate sampling points help, together with relevant theoretical models, build mathematical representation of chaotic changes occurring within material flow. Obtained curves fitted with a sum of two exponentially decreasing curves correspond well to the measurements but do not explain everything that happens during the process. Nevertheless they are used to model the cross-contamination phenomenon. Two unique cross-contamination models suitable for implementation in DES are developed, basing on principles of segmentation, quantity conservation, product similarity and proportionality, and are fundamentally models of mixing between material flow and residue in the crossed container. More general one, called partial mass exchange model, allows to customize fraction of material mixed, characteristic to a given piece of equipment, while the other, mixing model, assumes homogeneous resulting composition. Finally, a case-specific simulation model, joining material handling system with cross-contamination calculations as well as customizable layout configuration and settable scheduling methodologies, is established. Experimental setup with four-stage production process consisting of ingredient feeder, a single mixer, limited intermediate storage buffers and multiple system exits, mostly bagging machines, connected by conveying equipment, is discussed. All of the machines involved are multi-purpose, flexible but with some limitations, together with the interconnections and logic among them, basing on a genuine example. Analysis shows considerable impact of system layout and scheduling rules on product contamination. In order to limit cross-contamination appropriate product sequencing, minimising the differences between consecutive products in all stages of the process in needed, while that might impede throughput because of resulting constraints. There is thus a trade-off relation among various aspects of production efficiency, as well as amidst that efficiency and flexibility, when number of storage buffers and their capacity is changed. In the end, research first benefits from measuring the extent of cross-contamination, then succeeding in giving an original example of how to build a cross-contamination model, and how to combine it with a stochastic DES, capable of suiting different designs and scheduling methodologies. Performed experiments show, that cross-contamination effects can be reasonably well simulated with a DES model. It also describes possible effects of certain interventions on various performance indicators, and demonstrates possible risks of increasing flexibility in the system. Additional, more thorough trials are needed in the future to improve the model and generalise it further. Yet, the very important first step to understand the issue has been taken, which will aid in application to other types of systems as well as help in mitigating product contamination.

50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum bag molding {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a {{flexible}} male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor.
