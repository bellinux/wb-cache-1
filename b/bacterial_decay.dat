40|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} of onions {{have become a}} serious threat to the sustainability of the New York onion industry. Losses up to 40 % can occur as a result of reduced onion quantity and quality. Ultimately, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach will be required to manage bacterial {{diseases of}} which cultural practices will be important components. Recently, studies with small-scale production of onions on plastic mulch showed that when plant spacing was reduced from 6 or 8 to 4, this provided 53 to 64 % control of <b>bacterial</b> bulb <b>decay</b> at harvest. Marketable yield also increased by 1. 4 to 2. 4 times due to more marketable jumbo-sized bulbs. Wide plant spacing produced big bushy plants with more leaves, thicker necks, delayed maturity and bigger bulbs, and it was these bigger colossal-sized bulbs that rotted. By narrowing plant spacing, having significantly more healthy jumbo bulbs more than made up for fewer colossal bulbs. Whether reduced plant spacing also reduces <b>bacterial</b> bulb <b>decay</b> in direct seeded onions that are already grown at high plant populations warranted investigation. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effect on <b>bacterial</b> bulb <b>decay</b> and yield of plant and row spacing, and bulb area in large-scale production of direct seeded and transplanted onions. An on-farm small-plot research trial was conducted using transplanted onions (c. v. Canady) and included 13 planting configurations. Plant size and maturity trends were generally opposite of what was found previously in studies with small-scale onion production: in this study, plant height, number of leaves per plant and maturity generally increased as plant population increased. Despite this, yield and bulb size distribution were similar to previous results. There was a general trend that total yield, boiler, small and medium sized bulb weight, and economic return increased as plant population increased. Within each row spacing (15, 10 and 7. 5), these parameters increased as the plant spacing decreased from 8 to 6 to 4. Although less dramatic, within each plant spacing (4, 6 and 8), these parameters increased as row spacing decreased from 15 to 10 to 7. 5. Generally, yield increased as plant population increased because there were more bulbs per area to contribute to yield. Our data suggests that plant spacing is a stronger predictor of yield and bulb size than row spacing or bulb area. <b>Bacterial</b> bulb <b>decay</b> 9 weeks after the onions were pulled from the field ranged from 0. 8 to 3. 6 % incidence and no significant differences occurred among planting configurations. There were no significant correlations between incidence of <b>bacterial</b> bulb <b>decay</b> and plant size, maturity, yield and bulb size distribution. There was no relationship between <b>bacterial</b> bulb <b>decay</b> and plant population. Repeating this study is certainly warranted in order to generate robust data from which to make recommendations for planting configurations to manage bacterial diseases in large-scale onion production...|$|R

Bacterial density was esti− mated by epifluorescence microscopy. Cell count data fitted a negative exponential model in all three cases (p < 0. 00001). However, the slopes of their curves were significantly dif− ferent (p < 0. 01), {{as well as the}} percentage of bacterial loss after a period of two months. This fact might be related to the limnological characteristics of the water bodies, though the individual genetic variability of their bacterioplankton should not be left aside. Original bacterial numbers in the samples could also be a reason of the differences observed in the pattern of decay in cell counts. Thus, applying a general decay function to any sample and assuming the idea that freshwater bacterioplankton samples can be stored for a two month−period before the <b>bacterial</b> counts <b>decay,</b> can lead to an erroneous estimation of bac− terial numbers with direct consequences in ecological investigations.

Here we demonstrate the full functional regeneration of a salivary gland that reproduces the morphogenesis induced by reciprocal epithelial and mesenchymal interactions through the orthotopic transplantation of a bioengineered salivary gland germ as a regenerative organ replacement therapy. The bioengineered germ develops into a mature gland through acinar formations with a myoepithelium and innervation. The bioengineered submandibular gland produces saliva in response to the administration of pilocarpine and gustatory stimulation by citrate, protects against oral bacterial infection and restores normal swallowing in a salivary gland-defective mouse model.

40|$|The exoribonuclease polynucleotide {{phosphorylase}} (PNPase, encoded by pnp) is a {{major player}} in <b>bacterial</b> RNA <b>decay.</b> In Escherichia coli, PNPase expression is post-transcriptionally regulated at the level of mRNA stability. The primary transcript is very efficiently processed by the endonuclease RNase III at a specific site and the processed pnp mRNA is rapidly degraded in a PNPase-dependent manner. While investigating the PNPase autoregulation mechanism we found, by UV-cross-linking experiments, that the ribosomal protein S 1 in crude extracts binds to the pnp-mRNA leader region. We assayed the potential role of S 1 protein in pnp gene regulation by modulating S 1 expression from depletion to overexpression. We found that S 1 depletion led to a sharp decrease of the amount of pnp and other tested mRNAs, as detected by Northern blotting, whereas S 1 overexpression caused a strong stabilization of pnp and the other transcripts. Surprisingly, mRNA stabilization depended on PNPase, as it was not observed in a pnp deletion strain. PNPase-dependent stabilization, however, was not detected by chemical decay assay of bulk mRNA. Overall, our data suggest that PNPase exonucleolytic activity may be modulated by the translation potential of the target mRNAs and that, upon ribosomal protein S 1 overexpression, PNPase protects from degradation a set of full-length mRNAs. It thus appears that a single mRNA species may be differentially targeted to either decay or PNPase-dependent stabilization, thus preventing its depletion in conditions of fast turnover...|$|R

It is suggested that the macrobiota became entrapped in mucous-secreting mats of surface water blooms of planktonic diatoms in lake Florissant. As the mats and the incorporated macrobiota were sedimented out of the water column, the mucosic mats and their associated <b>bacterial</b> communities arrested <b>decay</b> and promoted preservation of refractory tissues.

40|$|Hfq is a small, highly {{abundant}} hexameric {{protein that}} {{is found in}} many bacteria and plays {{a critical role in}} mRNA expression and RNA stability. As an “RNA chaperone,” Hfq binds AU-rich sequences and facilitates the trans annealing of small RNAs (sRNAs) to their target mRNAs, typically resulting in the down-regulation of gene expression. Hfq also {{plays a key role in}} <b>bacterial</b> RNA <b>decay</b> by binding tightly to polyadenylate [poly(A) ] tracts. The structural mechanism by which Hfq recognizes and binds poly(A) is unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of Escherichia coli Hfq bound to the poly(A) RNA, A 15. The structure reveals a unique RNA binding mechanism. Unlike uridine-containing sequences, which bind to the “proximal” face, the poly(A) tract binds to the “distal” face of Hfq using 6 tripartite binding motifs. Each motif consists of an adenosine specificity site (A site), which is effected by peptide backbone hydrogen bonds, a purine nucleotide selectivity site (R site), and a sequence-nondiscriminating RNA entrance/exit site (E site). The resulting implication that Hfq can bind poly(A-R-N) triplets, where R is a purine nucleotide and N is any nucleotide, was confirmed by binding studies. Indeed, Hfq bound to the oligoribonucleotides (AGG) 8, (AGC) 8, and the shorter (A-R-N) 4 sequence, AACAACAAGAAG, with nanomolar affinities. The abundance of (A-R-N) 4 and (A-R-N) 5 triplet repeats in the E. coli genome suggests additional RNA targets for Hfq.

50|$|Bacterial genomes are {{generally}} smaller and less variant in size among species {{when compared with}} genomes of animals and single cell eukaryotes. Bacterial genomes can range in size anywhere from about 130 kbp to over 14 Mbp. A study that included, but was not limited to, 478 bacterial genomes, concluded that as genome size increases, the number of genes increases at a disproportionately slower rate in eukaryotes than in non-eukaryotes. Thus, the proportion of non-coding DNA goes up with genome size more quickly in non-bacteria than in bacteria. This {{is consistent with the}} fact that most eukaryotic nuclear DNA is non-gene coding, while the majority of prokaryotic, viral, and organellar genes are coding. Right now, we have genome sequences from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Second-generation sequencing has yielded many draft genomes (close to 90 % of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing might eventually yield a complete genome in a few hours. The genome sequences reveal much diversity in bacteria. Analysis of over 2000 Escherichia coli genomes reveals an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Genome sequences show that parasitic bacteria have 500-1200 genes, free-living bacteria have 1500-7500 genes, and archaea have 1500-2700 genes. A striking discovery by Cole et al. described massive amounts of gene decay when comparing Leprosy bacillus to ancestral bacteria. Studies have since shown that several bacteria have smaller genome sizes than their ancestors did. Over the years, researchers have proposed several theories to explain the general trend of <b>bacterial</b> genome <b>decay</b> and the relatively small size of bacterial genomes. Compelling evidence indicates that the apparent degradation of bacterial genomes is owed to a deletional bias.|$|R

Although more likely to produce a colony, the larger droplet nuclei were small in number, and the greatest numbers of colonies were instead produced by nuclei from 1. 5 to 5. 7 mu m. Very few colonies were produced by smaller droplet nuclei, despite their very large numbers. The concentration of viable bacteria within the dried sputum comprising the droplet nuclei exhibited an orderly dual decay over time with two distinct half-lives. Nuclei exhibiting a rapid biological decay process with a 10 second half-life were quickly exhausted, leaving only a subset characterized by a half-life of greater than 10 minutes. This finding implied that a subset of bacteria present in the aerosol was resistant to rapid biological decay and remained viable in room air long enough to represent an airborne infection risk...|$|R

As a consequence of the degradation reaction, carbon dioxide, protons and electrons were produced [5, 11]. The electrons flow through the circuit and the protons pass through the salt bridge (i.e. the PEM) that is attached to the cathode. The protons and electrons react with oxygen on the cathode and become water molecules thereby diluting the seawater to brine [12]. Since the influent BOD ranged from 150 to 300  mg/l (i.e. a weak domestic sewage) and as both MFCs showed an average removal rate ranging from 40 to 60  %, respectively, it can be inferred that a typical normal sewage strength as influent ranging from 300 to 600  mg/l would achieve improved BOD removal rates with subsequent higher levels of bioelectricity generated due to greater electron transfer to the anode.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{predictive}} modelling of {{the growth}} of microbial communities requires the credible representation of the interactions of biological, chemical and mechanical processes. However, although biological and chemical processes are represented in a number of Individual-based Models (IbMs) the interaction of growth and mechanics is limited.

This study focuses on addressing these limitations by developing a flexible IbM that can robustly combine the biological, chemical and physical processes that dictate the emergent properties {{of a wide range of}} bacterial communities.

The proportion of dissolved to total EEA (66 - 89 %, 44 - 88 %, 57 - 82 % and 86 - 100 % for AGase, BGase, APase and LAPase, respectively) was generally higher than the cell-associated (i. e., particulate) EEA. The percentage of dissolved to total EEA was inversely proportional to the percentage of erythromycin-inhibited to total EEA.
