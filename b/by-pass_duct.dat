40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is to {{identify}} potential improvements on Passenger cars Aerodynimcs (Drag reduction and Downforce increase) to help to minimize fuel consumption and hence reduce exhaust emisions. The Ahmed body (Bluff body) is representative of a passenger car under aerodynamical point of view. A lot of studies and literature exists as far as test reports of the Ahmed body on wind tunel tests. This work can be divided onto 2 steps. First step is to perform qualitative numerical simulations of a 3 D model of an Ahmed body modified with different aerodynimc improvements such as difuser integration downstream on the underbody of the vehicle (studying different configurations such as diferent lenghts, diferent angles and number an d location of vanes), study of aerodynamic modifications on the rear bumper to improve the weak low pressure region, study of <b>by-pass</b> <b>ducts</b> integration from the front glass to the rear glass, Rear Spoiler integration, vortex generators integration downstream over the roof and a new "double roof" concept. After evaluation of the perormance of such modifications on the Ahmed body, the second step of this work consists to implement a single modification or multiple moidifications on the geometry of a real passenger car and compare (as conclusion of this work) the CFD results of the passenger car quantitative simulations {{before and after the}} modifications were implemented...|$|R
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of conducting penetration tests on high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters as installed in nuclear ventilation systems. The in-place penetration test, {{which is designed to}} yield equivalent penetration measurements as the standard DOP efficiency test, is based on measuring the aerosol penetration of the filter installation as a function of particle size using a portable laser particle counter. This in-place penetration test is compared to the current in-place leak test using light scattering photometers for single HEPA filter installations and for HEPA filter plenums using the shroud method. Test results show the in-place penetration test is more sensitive than the in-place leak test, has a similar operating procedure, but takes longer to conduct. Additional tests are required to confirm that the in-place penetration test yields identical results as the standard dioctyl phthalate (DOP) penetration test for HEPA filters with controlled leaks in the filter and gasket and <b>duct</b> <b>by-pass</b> leaks. Further development of the procedure is also required to reduce the test time before the in- place penetration test is practical...|$|R

The aircraft speed at which this signal occurred and the frequency content of the signal fell within the test conditions of the experiment {{and had to be}} eliminated prior to continuing. The signal was identified as an aerodynamic excitation of an acoustic mode in the simulated <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct</b> of the nacelle.

40|$|Finite Element {{methods are}} {{presented}} for predicting fan noise radiation from turbofan aero-engines. Fan noise {{is a major}} contributors to whole aircraft noise for current High-Bypass-Ratio (HBR) aero-engines. The work reported here seeks to develop robust prediction methods for forward and aft-radiated noise {{which can be used}} to study and optimize the acoustic design of engine ducts. The current article focusses on propagation through the <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct.</b> Two hybrid methods are described in which in-duct propagation is predicted by using two different Finite Element approaches. Both are designed to model the effects of non-axisymmetric liners within such ducts. In both cases, radiation is dealt with by matching an in-duct finite element solution at the exhaust plane to an analytic radiation model which takes into account refraction through the shear layer and reflection from a acoustically hard centrebody. Results will be presented to illustrate the capabilities of such models and a simple benchmark problem is presented in which the predictions obtained from each methods are compared for acoustic scattering by hard rectangular patch in a lined annular duct...|$|E

In addition, Virginia Tech {{is working in}} partnership with Goodrich Aerospace, Aerostructures Group for the analytical development needed to support the experimental endeavor, i. e. model development, design, and system studies. In this project, Herschel-Quincke (HQ) liner technology experiments will be performed at the NASA Glenn Active Noise Control Fan (ANCF) facility. A schematic of both inlet and aft HQ-liner systems installed in the ANCF rig {{as well as a}} picture of the Glenn facility is shown. The main goal is to simultaneously test in both the inlet and bypass duct sections. The <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct</b> will have HQ-systems in both the inner and outer duct walls. The main advantages of performing tests at the ANCF facility are that the effect of the inlet HQ-system on the by-pass HQ-system and vice versa, can be accurately determined from the in-duct modal data. Another significant advantage is that it offers the opportunity to assess (on a common basis) the proposed noise reduction concept on the ANCF rig which in the past has been used for assessing other active and passive noise reduction strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} NOx {{emissions}} from marine engines proves a challenge. Diesel engine manufacturers have been investigating {{a variety of}} methods with aim of reducing NOx emissions. Currently, the plasma technology is undergoing rapid development in application to diesel engine exhausts. A combination of non-thermal plasma with catalysts can be referred to plasma assisted catalysts technology. This paper briefly describes research efforts aimed at non-thermal plasma reactor development for ship use with primary focus on NO oxidation condition.

40|$|Summary. [...] The 4 × 3 ft Wind Tunnel {{was erected}} {{as a model}} of larger tunnels to {{investigate}} unconventional design features directed towards obtaining a high standard of flow. Diffusers of- 5 deg cone angle are used, except for the rapid expansion through three wireTgauze screens up to tile maximum section. The contraction ratio is 31. 2 : 1 and nine screens are fitted in the maximum section. A speed control is used operating independently of the fan by means of a <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct.</b> The velocity distribution across the working-section is constant to- ± ~ per cent. The standard deviation of the velocity with time measured over a period of 50 sec is 0 " 03 per cent. The flow in the diffusers shows no tendency to separate and the velocity distribution approaching tile first screen is very satisfactory. The installation of cascades with gap/chord ratio of ~ gives uniform outlet flow without appreciable increase in the pressure drop. There is no separation in the rapid expansion of the bulge, but the flow in the contraction cone is not satisfactory. A longer contraction would have been advantageous. The power factor has been measured as 0. 27 with. all screens fitted but could be improved slightly if all the leaks were sealed...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the journal Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power and the definitive published version is available at [URL] manage the increasing turbine temperatures of future gas turbines a cooled-cooling air system has been proposed. In such a system some of the compressor efflux is diverted for additional cooling in a heat exchanger located in the <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct.</b> The cooled air must then be returned, across the main gas path, to the engine core for use in component cooling. One option is do this within the combustor module and two methods are examined in the current paper; via simple transfer pipes within the dump region or via radial struts in the pre-diffuser. This paper presents an experimental investigation to examine the aerodynamic impact these have on the combustion system external aerodynamics. This included the use of a fully annular, isothermal test facility incorporating a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine representative outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and combustor geometry. Area traverses of a miniature five-hole probe were conducted at various locations within the combustion system providing information on both flow uniformity and total pressure loss. The results show that, compared to a datum configuration, the addition of transfer pipes had minimal aerodynamic impact in terms of flow structure, distribution and total pressure loss. However, the inclusion of pre-diffuser struts had a notable impact increasing the pre-diffuser loss by a third and consequently the overall system loss by an unacceptable 40...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. As aero gas {{turbines}} strive for higher efficiencies and reduced fuel burn, {{the trend is}} for engine overall pressure ratio to increase. This means that engine cycle temperatures will increase and that cooling of various engine components, for example the high pressure turbine, is becoming more difficult. One solution is to employ a cooled cooling air system {{where some of the}} compressor efflux is diverted for additional cooling in a heat exchanger fed by air sourced from the <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct.</b> Design of the ducting to feed the heat exchangers with coolant air is challenging as it must route the air through the scenery present in the existing engine architecture which leads to a convoluted and highly curved system. Numerical predictions using ANSYS Fluent demonstrated that a baseline design was unsuitable due to large amounts of flow separation in the proximity of the heat exchangers. This paper is mainly concerned with the aerodynamic design of this component of the duct. In order to produce a viable aerodynamic solution a numerical design methodology was developed which significantly enhances and accelerates the design cycle. This used a Design of Experiments approach linked to an interactive design tool which parametrically controlled the duct geometry. Following an iterative process, individually optimized 2 D designs were numerically assessed using ANSYS Fluent. These designs were then fed into an interactive 3 D model in order to generate a final aerodynamic definition of the ducting. Further CFD predictions were then carried out to confirm the suitability of the design. RANS CFD solutions, generated, using a Reynolds stress turbulence model, suggested that the new design presented significant improvement in terms of diffusion and flow uniformity...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. The trend for higher overall {{pressure}} ratios means that turbine entry temperatures are continually increasing. Furthermore, {{the development of}} lean, low-emission combustion systems reduces the availability of cooling air and is accompanied by new problems at the combustor/turbine interface. For example, the exit temperature traverse differs from that found in traditional rich-burn combustors with increased swirl and a much flatter profile. Effectively cooling the turbine components is becoming increasingly difficult. One solution is to employ cooled cooling air (CCA) {{where some of the}} compressor efflux is diverted for additional cooling in a heat exchanger located in the <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct.</b> An example CCA system is presented which includes an off-take within the dump cavity and the addition of radial struts within the pre-diffuser through which the cooled air is returned to the engine core. This paper addresses the impact this CCA system has on the combustion system external aerodynamics. This included the development of a fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine relevant outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and combustor geometry. A datum aerodynamic performance was established for a non-CCA configuration with a clean, un-strutted prediffuser. Results for this baseline CCA system demonstrated that inclusion of a bleed in the dump cavity had limited effect on the overall flow field. However, the inclusion of struts within the pre-diffuser caused a reduction in area ratio and a notable increase in system loss. Consequently an alternative pre-diffuser was designed (using CFD) with the aim of increasing the area ratio back to that of the un-strutted datum. A so-called hybrid diffuser was designed in which the CCA bleed was moved to the pre-diffuser outer wall. The bleed was then used to re-energize the boundary layer, preventing flow separation, enabling the area ratio to be increased close to the datum value. The mechanisms of the hybrid diffuser are complex; the geometry of the off-take and its location with respect to the OGV and strut leading edge were seen to be critical. Experimental evaluation of the final design demonstrated the effective operation the hybrid diffuser with the result that the system loss returned to a level close to that of the datum. Only small differences were seen in the overall flow field...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at {{considering}} the aircraft engine conversion into peak or short-used energy unit, which is relevant for the task of developing the northern regions of the Russian Federation. The three-shaft turbojet engine with a twelve-stage compressor and a four-stage turbine is adopted as an aircraft engine under consideration. The afterburner with a block of jet nozzles {{is removed from the}} gas generator module, and a heating chamber is set at the outlet of the <b>by-pass</b> <b>duct</b> to raise electric power of engine and not complicate the construction by the presence of a mixing chamber. In addition, the heating chamber serves to equalize the total pressure and flow temperature in the section before the free turbine and allows the use of a short adapter between the gas generator module and the free turbine, which reduces the loss of total pressure. Then a free turbine and a diffuser with an exhaust device are installed. The output shaft of the power turbine is connected by means of a coupling to an alternating current (a. c.) generator or other special load. To find the parameters of the plant, a calculation was made in which the initial data were taken, namely a gas temperature in front of the turbine of 1530 K (the gas temperature in front of the turbine is reduced by 100 K in order to prolong the engine life; therefore, the gas temperature before the turbine was 1630 K); air flow of 364 kg/s; bypass ratio of 1. 36 (the ratio of the air flow passing through the bypass duct to the air flow entering the core). As a result, it consumes 0. 296 kg / (kWh) (fuel-aviation kerosene) and a power capacity of 78. 5 MW. For the received value of capacity the ТЗФП- 80 - 2 У 3 a. c. electric generator has been chosen as the load. As a result, the power plant, equipped with a converted engine and electric generator, has an electric power of 77. 3 MW and an efficiency of 27. 8 %. To assess the effect of introduced preheating chamber on the parameters of the gas turbine engine, a calculation was performed with no heating chamber, and it was obtained that the introduction of a heating chamber in the bypass duct to heat the bypass duct airflow from 402 K to 967 K, reduces the engine efficiency by 2 %, but increases its power by 79 % - from 43. 8 MW to 78. 5 MW. Due to the sufficiently high gas temperature, the converted engine has a relatively short lifetime. On the contrary, the free turbine has a longer life, and therefore {{there is no need to}} manufacture a free turbine for each converted engine. For an approximate evaluation of the free turbine life before the overhaul of the engine hot section, the maximum stress at the root of the working blade was calculated. For temperature values of 1000 K and stress of 242 MPa it is possible to create a turbine with a lifetime of over 30, 000 hours. </p...|$|E
