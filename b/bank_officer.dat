40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} accounting knowledge and experiences of Iranian <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> on the audit expectation gap, and investigates whether the gap mediates (or explains) the individual factor-loan decision performance relationship. Copies of a structured questionnaire were distributed to 113 loan officers from five large commercial banks in Iran and responses of 111 <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> were analysed. The results show {{the existence of a}} fairly large audit expectation gap among the Iranian <b>bank</b> loan <b>officers,</b> and accounting knowledge was found to significantly mitigate the extent of the gap. More importantly, this study found a highly significant negative relationship between the audit expectation gap and loan decision performance of the Iranian <b>bank</b> <b>officers.</b> Further analyses indicate that the audit expectation gap fully mediates the individual knowledge-performance relationship. The findings of this study have important policy implications for recruitment and training of the <b>bank</b> <b>officers.</b> accounting knowledge; audit expectation gap; accounting experience; Iran; bank officers; loan decisions; performance evaluation; commercial banks; recruitment; training. ...|$|R

40|$|Companies require {{capital to}} be able to finance their {{business}} and for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), credits from banks is {{the most common form of}} external financing. In <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> assesment of a company, information asymmetry occurs between <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> and business leaders. In order to reduce this information asymmetry <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> assess different information signals that the companies send out. In order to evaluate the financial information signals <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> mainly look at the companies financial statements. This may be a problem for knowledge-intensive companies regarding the abilty to be granted credits, because their assets consist mainly of intellectual capital, which is not shown in the financial reports. The purpose of this study is therefore to create an understanding of the bank officers’ credit assessment process for knowledge-intensive SMEs in an information asymmetric context. This by describing the information signals that <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> assess in the credit assessment process and the importance of these. The study also aims to identify the possible causes of the similarities and differences in the credit assessment of the knowledge-intensive SMEs compared to SMEs in general. The study is characterized by a qualitative method and has been conducted through interviews with twelve <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> involved in the administration of business loans. One conclusion in this study is that all <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> generally assess the same information signals but they put different emphasis and importance to them. The information signals that all <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> assess are; business leader, industry, competition, nature of the investment and business, financial ratios, repayment capacity and collateral. In addition to these, four additional information signals are identified that only some of the <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> assesses. These are; allocation between equity and borrowed capital, the environment and sustainability, ethics and which auditor the companies have. Another conclusion is that the information signals in terms of business leader, repayment capacity and the nature of the investment and business are more important than others in relation to each other, while the information signal collateral is of less importance. The study also shows that there are differences and difficulties in the credit assessment of the knowledge-intensive SMEs compared to SMEs in general. This because these companies have a greater dependence on individuals, have a small amount of material assets and because these companies often are more complex and sometimes operates in more niche markets.

40|$|Small {{businesses}} {{account for}} 99 % {{of the total}} amount of companies in Sweden, and thus are small businesses essential for Swedish industry. Bank loans are currently the most common external source of capital for small businesses seeking funding and when it involves a risk for the bank to lend money it requires that <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> makes a financial assessment. Financial assessment is characterized by asymmetric information, in order to manage the problem of information asymmetry, it is required that <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> collect and interpret signals from the small firms. Where there is room for <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> to interpret signals from the small businesses, it is relevant to study how the <b>bank</b> <b>officer's</b> knowledge structures affect the financial loan assessment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to create an understanding of how cognitive knowledge structures can be expressed in the <b>banking</b> <b>officer's</b> financial assessment of small business loan applications, this by, (1) identify key signals in the financial assessment of small business loan applications, and, (2) develop a model consisting of strategies for handling signals in the financial assessment for acceptance and rejection. This study shows that financial assessment is characterized by high complexity, which means that officer takes many signals into consideration in the loan assessment. The study has been able to identify key signals in the financial assessment of small business loan applications, where signals that affect the entrepreneurs, cash flow and collateral known as important. Additional evidence of this study proves the results of earlier studies, that <b>bank</b> <b>officers</b> knowledge structures are designed to handle the problems of information asymmetry.

This {{study was designed to}} explore the perceptions held by <b>bank</b> loan <b>officers</b> of male and female business owners, using Bourdieu's theory of practice and Kelly's personal construct methodology. The research literature might lead to an expectation that the characteristics of the business owners would be relatively homogenous but that men and women business owners would be construed differently (for example women might be seen to lack drive). However, the results demonstrate heterogeneity in the constructs held by <b>bank</b> loan <b>officers,</b> and a particular concern with the character of the business owner. Significant gender differences were observed in only 20 of the 325 constructs elicited from 35 <b>bank</b> loan <b>officers.</b> Female <b>bank</b> loan <b>officers</b> were as likely as male <b>bank</b> loan <b>officers</b> to draw gender distinctions between business owners.
