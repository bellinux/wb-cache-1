This project {{was commissioned by}} the V&A to redress this balance, focusing upon London couture, an area of British fashion which lacked academic and museological scrutiny. I case studied the work of leading couturier Catherine Walker. My research questions in curating this exhibition were to compare this business with the Parisian industry (identical apart from not staging a show); to identify the couturiers signatures (influenced by 1930 s <b>bias</b> <b>cuts</b> and flesh tones; lingerie; flowers and a preoccupation with flattering the feminine body) and reveal the commissioning and crafting of a couture garment. This evidence {{was not in the}} public domain. I contextualized Walker’s work within a continuum of London couture by examining the paper and clothing archives of historical couturiers at the V&A; and undertook research at Vogue House and LCF’s Special Collections.

The question of <b>bias</b> <b>cuts</b> to the core of what mediation is {{and the ways in which}} mediators can help the parties reach peace. Focusing on research on the role of neutrality and bias in international peace diplomacy in civil wars, this article draws out the policy implications of my own empirically-based work on the role of bias in the mediation of internal armed conflicts. This article suggests that neutrality should not be part of the definition of mediators, and that instead type and degree of bias should be treated as independent variables. In fact, my research has shown that biased mediators, under some conditions, outperform neutral mediators, and also importantly, that it matters in civil wars to which side the mediator is biased: for the government or for the rebel-side. This does not imply that neutral mediators have no role to play in peacemaking processes around the globe: this article discusses explicitly the implications of my research on how neutral mediators should engage themselves in order to bring about peace in civil wars. The article also discusses the notion of “insider-partial”, that is, third party actors within the conflict societies and it suggested that it is important to tap these domestic resources for peace...|$|R

40|$|Clothing damage {{analysis}} is a forensic discipline which provides mainly qualitative evidential value to criminal cases. This two-part investigation strengthens {{the value of}} clothing damage analysis through both quantitative and qualitative assessment. The aim of the first {{study was to determine}} whether the direction of a weapon (n= 6) has any influence on the force required to penetrate a 50 : 50 polyester/cotton blend fabric. This was carried out at 2 speeds - 100 mm/min and 2000 mm/min - in a controlled manner using a universal strength tester. Only 2 weapons displayed any distinct differences in forces between some, but not all directions. The variability and overlap of results dictates that caution must be exercised when reporting on the force required to stab fabric. The cut lengths were examined to determine whether stab cuts lengths reflected the weapon width. The cuts were always smaller than the blade width and the <b>bias</b> <b>cuts</b> were always smaller than those in the warp and weft; this was due to the natural stretch which is more pronounced in the bias. The aim of the second study was to discover the evidential value of clothing damage after weathering. Stab cuts were created by different knives (n= 2) into the same fabric draped over polystyrene, in the warp and bias directions. The samples were mounted and placed outside for periods of 1, 4 and 8 weeks. The damage was analysed through measurements of the cuts (quantitative), and the identity of the weapon was determined through the cut morphology (qualitative). The stab cuts lengths changed progressively through time, more so in the bias than the warp, but the weapon types remained identifiable. This outcome suggests that the evidential value of clothing after outdoor weathering remains high...|$|R

Critics question the jury 2 ̆ 7 s factfinding ability in cases with business and corporate parties, and doubt whether lay jurors can understand the often complex and esoteric evidence of business wrongdoing. Others claim that bias and prejudice, rather than evidence, determine jury decisions about businesses and corporations. The presumed <b>biases</b> <b>cut</b> both ways. The generally positive regard in which the public holds business is credited with creating leniency toward business wrongdoing. In contrast, other critics perceive harsh treatment for businesses in cases that pit corporations against individual litigants. Jurors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of and experiences with business, their understanding of business transactions, and their beliefs about the responsibilities of corporations in contemporary society may all play a role in their determination of liability and damages in specific trials.

The issue of jury competence in business cases is best addressed by analyzing existing research on jury decisionmaking. Two key questions about jury competence, reflecting two criticisms of the jury in business cases, will be explored here. First, what are the jury 2 ̆ 7 s factfinding abilities in such cases?

5000|$|During {{this entire}} period, a ball or evening dress was synonymous with court dress, as balls {{took place at}} court or in the palaces and salons of the nobility who copied the latest fashions at the courts. Starting with the late 18th century, the term [...] "evening or ball gown" [...] emerged, as balls and formal dances were no longer the sole domain of royals and aristocrats. The French Revolution had caused social upheaval, and firmly {{cemented}} the place of upper-middle and upper class citizens in society. A common silhouette for evening wear, just as for day wear, was the high-waisted Empire or Regency dress. Evening versions featured lower necklines, short sleeves and elaborate fabrics and embroidery. Evening styles changed dramatically during the 19th century, and evolved from the relatively simple classically inspired lines of the early decades to progressively fuller skirts and, at times, sleeves (1830s and 1840s). The styles ranged from having huge sleeves in the 1830s, to off-the-shoulder and with wide flounces in the 1840s, to very low-necked in the 1850s, to having low necklines and short sleeves in the 1860s, to long and lean with a bustle and very short sleeves in the 1870s, to sleeveless, low-necked, and worn with gloves in the 1880s, to having a squared decolletage, a wasp-waist cut, and skirts with long trains in the 1890s. The 19th century distinguished between relatively high-necked dinner gowns for formal dinners and soirees, evening gowns for dances and theatre events, and ball gowns for the most formal affairs including balls and the opera.During the Edwardian era, or Belle Epoque, the s-shaped figure was fashionable, which included a very narrow waist. Immediately preceding and during World War I, lines became looser and more fluid as a precursor to the boyish silhouettes of the 1920s. Later, in the 1920s, the hemlines of evening gowns rose and cuts were very simple to match the new life style of the Flapper era. The 1930s introduced <b>bias</b> <b>cuts</b> and artificial fibres. Along with the Empire cut, {{over the years the}} sheath, mermaid, A-line, and trumpet shapes became popular. Also, the dropped waist and princess styles were popular, depending on the era. Grace Kelly is noted for wearing understated evening gowns.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, Vionnet {{had created}} a stir by {{developing}} garments utilizing the <b>bias</b> <b>cut,</b> a technique for cutting cloth diagonal to {{the grain of the}} fabric, enabling it to cling to the body while stretching and moving with the wearer. While Vionnet herself did not invent the method of cutting fabric on the bias, she was the first to utilize bias cuts for the entirety of a garment. Her work contrasted existing garments that utilized bias cutting for trims and embellishments placed on fabric pieces cut along the straight-of-grain. Vionnet's use of the <b>bias</b> <b>cut</b> to create a sleek, flattering, body-skimming look revolutionized women's clothing and carried her {{to the top of the}} fashion world. Although sometimes credited with its invention, Vionnet claimed to have applied the technique, already used in skirts, trims, and embellishments, to full-body dresses. As an expert couturier, Vionnet knew that textiles cut on the bias could be draped to match the curves of a woman's body and express fluidity of motion. She used the cut to promote the potential for expression and motion, integrating comfort and movement as well as form into her designs.|$|E

These fault array models varied in the number of relay zones, relative position of fault segments, size of overlap zones, and number of relay faults. We automatically generated a flow model from each fault array model in four main steps: (1) stochastic computation of relay fault throw, (2) horizon building, (3) generation of a flow simulation grid, and (4) definition of the static and dynamic parameters. Flow simulations performed on these stochastic fault models with deterministic petrophysical parameters entailed significant variability of reservoir behavior, which cannot always discriminate between the types of fault segmentation.

40|$|Enumeration of bounded size cuts is an {{important}} step in several logic synthesis algorithms such as technology mapping and re-writing. Since the standard algorithm enumerates all cuts, it does not scale beyond 6 or 7 input cuts (because there are many such cuts). We address the enumeration problem by introducing the notion of factor cuts. The set of factor cuts of a network is a small and efficiently enumerable subset of the set of all cuts that has the property that any cut of the network can be obtained easily from. In this paper we present the theory behind factor cuts and consider their use in depth-oriented FPGA mapping for large (upto 12 -input) LUTs and macrocells. In LUT mapping, we find that considering only factor cuts guarantees depth optimality for most nodes in the network. For the remaining, other cuts need to be generated from factor cuts and examined. In macrocell mapping, we focus on a particular 9 -input macrocell, and use factor cuts as a heuristic method to improve depth by reducing structural <b>bias.</b> Factor <b>cuts</b> are used to map the macrocell as a whole whenever possible instead of mapping its parts separately.
