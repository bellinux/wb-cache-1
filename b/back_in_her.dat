5|$|Throughout the day, Warren's {{squadron}} closed {{from the}} north-east while Bompart made frantic {{efforts to reach}} open water. Both fleets were hindered by a gale which swept the sea shortly before 20:00. All three of Hoches topmasts were blown down and her mizzensail shredded, leaving her substantially slower than her compatriots and forcing them to hold <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> defence. Other ships suffered too, as the French Résolue sprang a severe leak and HMS Anson lost her mizzenmast and several topmasts.|$|E
5|$|Olivia rejoins Henry {{and then}} leaves him to swim {{the rest of}} the way in and make her way to the {{isolation}} tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters the tank and soon finds herself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E

However, Gothel, unwilling to lose Rapunzel, chains her up and gags her with a white handkerchief. When Flynn, having managed {{to escape from the}} castle, arrives at the tower, Gothel stabs him. Desperate to save him, Rapunzel promises to do whatever Gothel pleases in return. Gothel complies, but just as Rapunzel is about to heal him, Flynn cuts her hair short, causing it to turn brown and lose all of its magical powers and might never be long again, resulting in Gothel's death. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms and she cries bitterly. However, the flower's magic manifests itself through Rapunzel's tears and returns Flynn to life. Flynn returns Rapunzel to the palace, where she is finally reunited with her parents.|$|E
5|$|During {{her return}} from Korea, Sydney ferried Spitfires and Vampires between several British bases in Southeast Asia. After a brief refit, Sydney {{embarked}} the 20th CAG in June 1952, before proceeding on a round-Australia cruise. The carrier visited Manus Island, was present {{off the coast}} of the Montebello Islands for the first British atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, on 3 October, and arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> namesake city in November. On 25 March 1953, Sydney departed for England with representatives from each of the three branches of the Australian and New Zealand militaries for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The carrier and her aircraft participated in the Coronation Fleet Review on 15 June, and visited Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, Panama, Hawaii, and New Zealand on the return voyage, before reaching Sydney on 15 August. The carrier's 10,000th deck landing occurred during this voyage: a Firefly completed the landing on 17 July, while Sydney was en route to Pearl Harbor.|$|E

60|$|I {{advanced}} {{towards the}} noise, {{and found myself}} standing before {{the open door of}} a large store-room at the extreme end of the passage. In {{the middle of the room}} (issuing household commodities to the cook) sat Mrs. Finch. She was robed this time in a petticoat and a shawl; and she had the baby and the novel laid together flat on their <b>backs</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap.|$|R
25|$|Vélez's ire and jealousy {{was often}} {{targeted}} at fellow actresses whom she deemed as rivals, professionally or otherwise, a habit which began <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> vaudeville days and continued in films.|$|E
25|$|When {{they get}} back to the classroom, they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The Flyboat also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming is always the first one to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes a bite out of the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|E
25|$|Yorktown arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{home port}} on 18 June 1963 and resumed normal {{operations}} until the fall, {{then went into}} drydock at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard facility at Long Beach Ca. The Yorktown came out of yard {{in the spring of}} 1964. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.|$|E

25|$|After Marcella {{divorced}} Agrippa, Octavia Minor received Marcella <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> house. Octavia Minor married Marcella to {{the future}} consul Iullus Antonius, the second son of Mark Antony from his third wife Fulvia who was held in high regard by Augustus. Marcella bore Iullus Antonius one son. The son Lucius Antonius was sent to study in Marseilles (not an official exile) sometime after the disgrace of his father. In 2 BC, Iullus Antonius was forced to commit suicide after being found guilty of adultery with Julia the Elder.|$|E
25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E
25|$|The two land in an {{isolated}} village called Wormwood Creek, whose residents have come to despise outsiders after an attack by the Gittish Empire hundreds of years ago. The main character is met with hostility {{by all of the}} town's residents except for the mayor's nephew, Wallace, who sympathizes with the main character and helps him/her recover. Thinking he/she may be an accomplice of Barbarus, the townspeople kick the main character out of town, despite Wallace's protests. Wallace then suggests that the main character travel to the town of Upover and enlist the help of Barbarus' mortal enemy: Greygnarl, the legendary dragon that lives atop a volcano called the Magmaroo. In order to open the path to Upover, Wallace directs the main character to a sealed cave known as the Bowhole. Along the way, the main character and Stella meet a ghost named Serena who is searching for Corvus, the former guardian Celestrian of Wormwood Creek and Aquila's mentor. Serena reveals that she was the daughter of Wormwood Creek's elder who nursed Corvus back to health after he fell from the Observatory. When the Gittish Empire invaded the town and tried to take Serena, Corvus fought <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> defense and forced them to retreat, only for them to return later and kill her.|$|E

25|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{home state}} of California, Anderson competed for the National Wrestling Alliance's Pro Wrestling Revolution (PWR) {{promotion}} {{in a series of}} matches fought under the ChickFight banner. After her first loss in an NWA World Women's Championship match against MsChif, (see below) she went on a winning streak under the gimmicks of both Cheerleader Melissa and Raisha Saeed. This streak included a victory against Lacey Von Erich in one of her first matches, as well as double victories over Christie Ricci, Christina Von Eerie and Rain, the latter two under both characters. This long series of wins led to her, under the Alissa Flash name, competing against the luchadora Lady Apache to crown the inaugural PWR Women's Champion on January 30, 2010. In losing her first match in 20 months, she lost out on the championship. A year later, on February 5 she wrestled in Shantelle Malawski's retirement match, picking up the victory. On February 23, 2013, Melissa defeated Dark Angel to win the vacant PWR Women's Championship for the first time. She lost the title to Ivelisse Vélez on April 21 at a pay-per-view held by the Puerto Rican World Wrestling League (WWL) promotion. She regained the championship three weeks later at a PWR event on 11 May.

500|$|The 1907 edition runs to some 30 full-page colour plates, {{and over}} 100 full-page {{illustrations}} in monochrome. These include photographs, such {{as of the}} housekeeper standing with hands behind her <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> kitchen (pictured), facing {{the first page of}} Chapter 2, [...] "The Housekeeper". An idea of the amount of detail may be gained from {{the fact that there are}} 11 illustrations of types of fish (one pictured), such as [...] "steamed sole" [...] and [...] "soused mackerel", and another of [...] "fish entrées".|$|E

50|$|Rick {{was very}} worried about Cal, which led to him {{breaking}} off with Meg and throwing <b>her</b> financial <b>backing</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face. After she was well enough to do so, she and Rick got married. She {{proved to be a}} fantastic mother to Hank, Rick's son by his first marriage to Barbara Sterling. After all the trouble they went through dealing with the unrepentant Meg, Cal, Rick and Hank left Rosehill and moved to Montreal to begin a new life together.|$|R
500|$|Aguilera {{performed}} [...] "You Lost Me" [...] for {{the first}} time at the season finale of the ninth season of American Idol on May 26, 2010. Following the rendition of Aguilera's songs [...] "Beautiful" [...] and [...] "Fighter" [...] by the top six female contestants, Aguilera appeared onstage as the stage went dark. Wearing a [...] "demure black ensemble", her hair was pulled <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> curls. On June 8, 2010, Aguilera performed the song again with several of her tracks, [...] "Fighter", [...] "Bionic", [...] "Not Myself Tonight", and [...] "Beautiful". According to James Dinh from MTV News, the performance of [...] "You Lost Me" [...] "brought a subtle and gentle ambience" [...] to the show, and it was not aired on television.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film character has been generally negative. For instance, Richard Corliss of TIME wrote Mila Kunis was [...] "not up to the task" [...] and GameZone's David Sanchez opined that [...] "Mila Kunis ain't got nothin' on Kathy Tong". In 2011, Complex ranked Kunis as the tenth-most miscast action movie hero, because [...] "her character, Mona Sax, is a heart-attack-serious Russian assassin, a description that brings to mind Amazon woman Brigitte Nielsen <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> Red Sonja days; Kunis, on the other hand, is petite and angelic-faced." [...] Nevertheless, Kunis was nominated in the category [...] "Choice Movie Actress: Action Adventure" [...] at Teen Choice Awards 2009 for her portrayal of Mona in the film. She was also ranked as the [...] "eighth-hottest game girl" [...] by Phil Hornshaw of GameFront in 2010 because the role, along with her enjoyment of World of Warcraft, earned her [...] "some digital street cred".|$|E
500|$|Black's {{voice has}} been {{described}} as raspy, death growls often appearing in her music. In an interview with The Advocate, Black revealed that she has always had this talent and that it is something she has never practiced. RedOne, the producer who signed her to his label, says that Black's voice and attitude reminded him of Joan Jett. He concluded that [...] "he can scream and do things with her voice that nobody can do. She is uncompromising in pursuing her own creative vision. She's taking everything that's old and making it futuristic and bringing rock and roll <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own way." [...] Black styled her musical genre [...] "horror-pop". It {{has been described}} as the love child between Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears, a fusion of dance-pop and darker industrial themes. Black cites that Spears inspires her deep love for choreography, while Manson inspires the sound and attitude of her lyrics and performance style.|$|E
5000|$|After an ACL injury {{during her}} sophomore year, which {{caused her to}} miss all of the 2006 NCAA postseason games, Dew came <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> junior year to anchor the central defense, guiding freshmen Lauren Fowlkes and Julie Scheidler, and junior {{transfer}} Elise Weber, to form an impressive defense that saw a 17-game unbeaten streak in 2007.|$|R
