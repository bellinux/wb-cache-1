5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German <b>barbwire</b> defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, the {{battalion}} relocated to Bullecourt {{in preparation for}} {{an attack on the}} Hindenburg Line. On the night of 11 April, seven battalions of the 4th Australian Division assembled for the advance, which was launched at 04:30. Murray's company seized a section of German trench, but were quickly isolated. By 07:00, ammunition was running low and casualties were high. Murray sent for artillery support, but conflicting messages meant that it was not provided, so the Australians were forced to withdraw. During the action, the 4th Division lost 2,339 of the 3,000 men that it had committed, with 1170 captured as prisoners of war. Among the dead was Percy Black, who had been killed while trying to find a gap in the <b>barbwire</b> surrounding the German trenches. Murray was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for his efforts during the battle, and was promoted to temporary major. He was later informed by General Birdwood that had the attack at Bullecourt been successful, he would have instead been awarded a Bar to his Victoria Cross.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} verse, a mad scientist, portrayed by Kinney, {{seemingly}} tortures Gaga, who {{is wearing a}} yellow dress with glasses made of <b>barbwire,</b> as another version of the singer, with teal-colored hair, performs a dance routine with her backup dancers in a barn. As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yüyi the Mermaid, with gills {{on her face and}} neck, as she lies in a tub filled with dirty water. At the end of the chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings [...] "You and I" [...] in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yüyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a chair with a conveyor belt. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yüyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yüyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black.|$|E

50|$|Tada {{served as}} the {{director}} of the Miyako Nanseien Sanatorium during World War II. He intensified the strict segregation of patients through the construction of <b>barbwired</b> fences, and the building of a special prison. At that time, two nurses performed a vasectomy and an artificial abortion, with no records of him performing either operation. Tada declared that the mark of a red cross would prevent air-raids, but the sanatorium was destroyed by air-raids. Since the houses of the sanatorium workers were also destroyed, he and other leaders of the sanatorium escaped in a shelter of the army, while 110 in-patients died either of malaria, malnutrition, or as direct effect of air-raids in 1945.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the availability of safety and security facilities in public primary schools in Kaduna state. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design. A questionnaire titled “Availability of Safety and Security Facilities in Public Primary Schools” (ASSFPPS) was used for data collection. Twenty (20) randomly selected primary schools {{were used for the}} study. A total of Fifty (50) head teachers and teachers participated by responding to the items on the questionnaire. The data collected were analysed using frequencies and percentages. The findings of the study revealed the dearth of safety and security facilities in primary schools in Kaduna, as there were only very few of such facilities available in the schools that were visited. It was recommended as a matter of urgency that government should provide safety and security facilities such as fences with security <b>barbwires,</b> lockable gates, metal detectors, fire extinguishers, uniformed armed security personnel, close circuit television cameras, among others. Head teachers and other school personnel should be security conscious and alert at all times. School authorities should beef up security in all nooks and corners of their schools to make their schools safe havens for teaching and learning. All staff should be trained in safety and security management. Safety and security concepts {{should be included in the}} universal basic education curriculum across all classes to create the necessary awareness in the most vulnerable children in our society. A school environment devoid of crime, abduction, rape, violence and the likes is a place where meaningful learning can take place. Safety and security should be regarded as the business of all and the responsibility of all. Therefore, all hands must be on deck to make our society safe and sound in order to achieve global security...|$|R
