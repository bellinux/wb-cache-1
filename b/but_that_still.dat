If it is Cornish then 'Dun' would mean Fort. Oliver Padel proposes 'Dun' '-tagell' meaning narrow place in his book on place names.

He had not had any medical insurance through his employer and had been unable to purchase insurance due to a pre-existing condition. Although he had been able to receive medical care he required over the course of his illness, when he died the bills for that care amounted to about $400,000. His friends, including Paul, were able to raise about $50,000, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> left $350,000 to be passed to his estate — or left unpaid (and passed on to other consumers and taxpayers).|$|E
500|$|Prefix writer Craig Hubert {{rated the}} album 5 out of 10, {{and said it}} had more [...] "definable hooks" [...] than most other metal albums, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> made the record no better or more accessible.

Speaking from his perspective as an aged listener and someone who is not a fan of modern rock music, Jay Bennett of the Phoenix New Times gave the album a grade of B. He described the album as “a pleasant surprise”, saying that he was not a fan of metal from recent years but that the album has “a lot more in common with the late-‘70s and early-‘80s-era Judas Priest and Iron Maiden”, which he liked.|$|E
500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E

2500|$|Seyferts {{were first}} {{classified}} as Type I or II, {{depending on the}} emission lines shown by their spectra. The spectra of Typenbsp&I Seyfert galaxies show broad lines that include both allowed lines, like Hnbsp&I, Henbsp&I or Henbsp&II and narrower forbidden lines, like Onbsp&III. They show some narrower allowed lines as well, but even these narrow lines are much broader than the lines shown by normal galaxies. However, the spectra of Typenbsp&II Seyfert galaxies show only both permitted and forbidden narrow lines. Forbidden lines are spectral lines that occur due to electron transitions not normally allowed by the selection rules of quantum mechanics, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> have a small probability of spontaneously occurring. The term [...] "forbidden" [...] is slightly misleading, as the electron transitions causing them are not forbidden but highly improbable.|$|E

The Five Owls review journal noted the [...] "innovative mixture of history and fiction" [...] and said the book was [...] "expertly crafted and consistently involving, it is sure to excite, enthrall, and challenge readers."

60|$|On one occasion, {{and that}} at night, the {{dew-point}} was as low as 11.5 degrees, with a temperature of 66 degrees, a depression rarely equalled at so low a temperature: this phenomenon was transient, and caused by {{the passage of a}} current of air loaded with dust, whose particles possibly absorbed the atmospheric humidity.

That if his majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to spare your life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he humbly conceived, that by this expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor, {{as well as the}} fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to be his counsellors.

I recollected a passage in Grimm's Correspondence, that while the unexhausted Voltaire sent forth tract after tract to the very close of a long life, the first impression made by each as it appeared, was, that it was inferior to its predecessors; an opinion adopted from the general idea that the Patriarch of Ferney must at last find the point from which he was to decline. But the opinion of the public finally ranked in succession the last of Voltaire's Essays on the same footing with those which had formerly charmed the French nation. The inference from this and similar facts seemed to me to be, that new works were often judged of by the public, not so much from their own intrinsic merit, as from extrinsic ideas which readers had previously formed with regard to them, and over which a writer might hope to triumph by patience and by exertion.
