Previously, the hammerhead ribozyme conjugated with aptamer through its stem II module {{showed a significant}} <b>blank</b> <b>signal</b> by self-cleavage. To reduce or remove its self-cleavage activity {{in the absence of}} target molecule, rational designs were attempted by reducing the binding affinity of the aptazyme to its RNA substrate, while maintaining the ribonuclease activity of the aptazyme. Interestingly, the bis-aptazymes which comprise the two aptamer-binding sites at both stem I and stem III of the hammerhead ribozyme showed very low <b>blank</b> <b>signals,</b> and their ratios of reaction rate constants, i. e. signal to noise ratios, were several tens to hundred times higher than those of the stem II-conjugated bis-aptazymes. The reduction in the <b>blank</b> <b>signals</b> seems to be caused by a higher dissociation constant between the main strand of the bis-aptazyme and its substrate arising from multi-point base-pairing of the bis-aptazymes. The bis-aptazymes for HCV replicase and helicase showed high selectivity against other proteins, and a linear relationship existed between their ribozyme activities and the target concentrations. In addition, a bis-aptazyme of dual functions was designed by inserting both aptamers for HCV replicase and helicase into the stem I and stem III of hammerhead ribozyme, respectively, and it also showed greater sensitivity and specificity for both proteins without <b>blank</b> <b>signal...</b>|$|R
