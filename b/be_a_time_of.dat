25|$|Based on Jesus' {{doctrine}} of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds and their omission is a reason for damnation. Because the Messianic Age will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> mercy, and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures, Catholics perform the works of mercy.|$|E
25|$|After {{succeeding}} his father, Osorkon II {{was faced}} with the competing rule of his cousin, king Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Osorkon feared the serious challenge posed by Harsiese's kingship to his authority but, when Harsiese conveniently died in 860 BC, Osorkon II ensured that this problem would not recur by appointing his own son Nimlot C as the next High Priest of Amun at Thebes. This consolidated the pharaoh's authority over Upper Egypt and meant that Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> large-scale monumental building and prosperity for Egypt.|$|E

Prayers may be recited from memory, read {{from a book}} of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events {{in the life of}} a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.|$|E

In 1984, the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall, its original home until 1926, when it moved to Darlington (a section of Mahwah {{centered on a}} grand mansion and estate). The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987. With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 and 1988, and the purchase of an off-campus apartment building in 1990, the University made significant changes to account for {{a larger number of}} student residents. Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus, providing living space for about 2100 students.|$|E

Mr Apjohn was very much praised for his energy in having forced the man to take his action against Mr Evans, and no one was more inclined to praise him than Mr Evans himself.

60|$|Indeed, {{sense and}} reason saith, it is a fearful {{thing for the}} church of God {{to be exposed to}} the rage of her enemy all over the world at once; and that all nations should shut up their gates, let down their portcullises, bolt up their doors, and set open their flood-gates to destroy them: but so will be the {{dispensation}} of God, to the end deliverance may be the sweeter, and the enemies fall the more headlong, and the arm of God the more manifest, both for the one, and against the other. And in this will that scripture be fulfilled: 'And there shall <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> trouble, such as never was since there was a nation--and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book' (Dan 12:1).|$|E
60|$|I do {{not believe}} that the {{majority}} of the Northern people at that time were in favor of negro suffrage. They supposed that it would naturally follow the freedom of the negro, but that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> probation, in which the ex-slaves could prepare themselves for the privileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred; but Mr. Johnson, after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regard the South not only as an oppressed people, but as the people best entitled to consideration of any of our citizens. This was more than the people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union were prepared for, and they became more radical in their views. The Southerners had the most power in the executive branch, Mr. Johnson having gone to their side; and with a compact South, and such sympathy and support as they could get from the North, they felt that they would be able to control the nation at once, and already many of them acted as if they thought they were entitled to do so.|$|E
