5|$|Ticks {{have four}} stages to their lifecycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ixodid ticks have three hosts, taking {{at least a}} year to {{complete}} their lifecycle. Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a <b>blood</b> <b>meal.</b> Because of their habit of ingesting blood, ticks are vectors of at least twelve diseases that affect humans and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{infection}} develops via two phases: {{one that}} involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically {{for a period of}} 8–30 days.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent <b>blood</b> <b>meal.</b>|$|E
40|$|Blood fed Culex quinquefasciatus were {{collected}} from residential and wetland sites in Tucson, Arizona for three years using CDC gravid traps. An ELISA distinguishing human, bird, dog, cat, and rabbit <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> was used. In residential areas, approximately 47 % of all identified <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> were from humans, with fewer <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> from bird, dog, cat, and rabbit. At Sweetwater Wetland, humans were also the most common host, with 11 (41 %) identified <b>blood</b> <b>meals.</b> Birds were the hosts of 19 % <b>blood</b> <b>meals.</b> Ten (seven residential, three wetland) mosquitoes were identified to have blood from both bird and human hosts. Since the transmission of West Nile Virus to humans is dependent on mosquitoes feeding both on birds and humans, this finding is particularly relevant. These data only describe the feeding choices of the mosquitoes collected from {{a limited number of}} sites in Tucson, and therefore, may not reflect feeding preferences more generally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) heteroduplex assay (HDA) was developed to identify avian derived mosquito <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> to the species level. The assay used primers amplifying a fragment of the cytochrome B gene from vertebrate but not invertebrate species. In Culex tarsalis fed on quail, PCR products derived from the quail cytochrome B gene were detected seven days post-engorgement. In an analysis of wild-caught mosquitoes, 85 % of blood-fed mosquitoes produced detectable PCR products. Heteroduplex patterns obtained from bird-derived PCR products were found to permit the unambiguous identification of all species examined. No intraspecific variation in HDA patterns was found. The PCR-HDA was used to characterize <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> in wild caught Cx. tarsalis. Of the 67 <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> analyzed, 60 % were derived from avian sources. Of the avian <b>blood</b> <b>meals,</b> 65 % were derived from a single host, the common grackle...|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} Chrysops spp biting habits showed that C. silacea and C. dimidiata take human <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> {{approximately}} 90% of the time, with hippopotamus, wild ruminant, rodent, and lizard <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> {{making up the}} other 10%. The fact that no simian (ex: monkeys or apes) <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> were taken {{suggests that there is}} no crossover between the human and simian types of Loa loa. A related fly, Chrysops langi, has been isolated as a vector of simian loiasis, but this variant hunts within the forest and has not as yet been associated with human infection.|$|R
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E
5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} host {{specificity}} of blood-sucking invertebrates may have both ecological and evolutionary {{implications for the}} parasites they are transmitting. We used <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> from wild-caught blackflies for molecular identification of parasites and hosts to examine patterns of host specificity and how these may affect the transmission of avian blood parasites of the genus Leucocytozoon. We found that five different species of ornithophilic blackflies preferred different species of birds when taking their <b>blood</b> <b>meals.</b> Of the blackflies that contained avian <b>blood</b> <b>meals,</b> 62 % were infected with Leucocytozoon parasites, consisting of 15 different parasite lineages. For the blackfly species, {{there was a significant}} association between the host width (measured as the genetic differentiation between the used hosts) and the genetic similarity of the parasites in their <b>blood</b> <b>meals.</b> The absence of similar parasite in <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> from blackflies with different host preferences is interpreted {{as a result of the}} vector-host associations. The observed associations between blackfly species and host species are therefore likely to hinder parasites to be transmitted between different host-groups, resulting in ecologically driven associations between certain parasite lineages and hosts species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To date, no {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} diagnostic technique exists to directly identify mammalian <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> from mosquitoes by sized DNA fragments following agarose gel electrophoresis. We have developed a vertebrate-specific multiplexed primer set based on mitochondrial cytochrome b to identify the mammalian blood hosts of field-collected mosquitoes. Although designed {{for the study of}} African malaria vectors, the application of this tool is not restricted to this disease system. Validation of this diagnostic technique on dried anopheline and culicine field specimens collected in Zambia and Mali demonstrated that <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> could be identified 2 – 7 months after collection. Time course experiments showed that host DNA was detectable in frozen mosquito abdomens 24 – 30 hours post-feeding. Additionally, multiple <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> from different mammals could be detected in a single mosquito. This diagnostic assay will be a valuable tool for identifying the <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> of field-collected mosquitoes where people and alternative mammal hosts are present...|$|R
5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{transmission}} {{involves the}} direct {{transmission of the}} same individual trypanosomes taken from an infected host into an uninfected host. The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to mechanical injection with a syringe. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as horse-flies, can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Ixodes holocyclus {{consists}} of four (4) stages- egg, larva, nymph, adult. Ticks hatch as six-legged larvae after an incubation period of 40 to 60 days. Larvae search for a <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> from a host, feed for four to six days, then drop from the host and moult to become an eight-legged nymph. Nymphs require a second <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> before they can moult again to become an adult. Female adults then require a further <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> of up to ten days before dropping off to lay up to 3000 eggs in leaf litter. Male adults will search for females on the host for mating, and to parasitise the females for blood meals. This life cycle takes around a year to complete (average 365 days, minimum 135 days, maximum 437 days).|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{proportion}} of <b>blood</b> <b>meals</b> that mosquitoes take from a host species {{is a function}} of the interplay of extrinsic (abundance and location of potential hosts) and intrinsic (innate preference) factors.

25|$|In the {{mosquito}} Anopheles stephensi Liston, trypsin activity is restricted {{entirely to the}} posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut {{to a maximum of}} 12 EU at 30 hours after the <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. Alpha-glucosidase is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, alpha-glucosidase activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of alpha-glucosidase is located in the anterior midgut. After <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminoptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. Alpha-glucosidase activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the <b>blood</b> <b>meal,</b> whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.|$|E

Simulium soubrense Beffa form, S. squamosum C and S. sanctipauli Pra form were the most anthropophagic (HBI[*]=[*] 0. 92, 0. 86 and 0. 70, respectively); S. squamosum E, S. yahense and S. damnosum (sensu stricto) (s. s.) /S. sirbanum were the most zoophagic (HBI[*]=[*] 0. 44, 0. 53 and 0. 63, respectively). The degree of anthropophagy decreased (but not statistically significantly) with increasing ratio of non-human/human blood hosts. Vector to human ratios ranged from 139 to 1, 198 blackflies/person.

25|$|Typically, {{both male}} and female {{mosquitoes}} feed on nectar and plant juices, but in many species the mouthparts of the females are adapted for piercing the skin of animal hosts and sucking their blood as ectoparasites. In many species, the female needs to obtain nutrients from a <b>blood</b> <b>meal</b> before it can produce eggs, whereas in many other species, it can produce more eggs after a <b>blood</b> <b>meal.</b> A mosquito has a variety of ways of finding its prey, including chemical, visual, and heat sensors. Both plant materials and blood are useful sources of energy in the form of sugars, and blood also supplies more concentrated nutrients, such as lipids, but the most important function of blood meals is to obtain proteins as materials for egg production.|$|E
