In the criminal case filed before the Judicial First class Magistrate's Court in Trivandrum, the producer, director, writer and artists Jayaram, Jayasurya, Bhavana, Reema Kallungal, and Samwrutha Sunil are the accused. The artists, according to the complainant are offenders for abetting the crime. The Court has, as of 23 March 2012, taken the complaint to the file and is proceeding with it. The complainant, it is learnt, alleges that the script of the movie is a scene by scene <b>blind</b> <b>copy</b> of the Hindi movie.

The key {{idea is that the}} similarity between the copied and moved blocks from the LL 1 subband should be high, while the one from the HH 1 subband should be low due to noise inconsistency in the moved block. We sort pairs of blocks based on high similarity using the LL 1 subband and high dissimilarity using the HH 1 subband. Using thresholding, we obtain matched pairs from the sorted list as copied and moved blocks. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method over competitive methods using DWT and the LL 1 or HH 1 subbands only.

Data analyses have revealed that real-world clusters exhibit {{a broad spectrum of}} τ-values, 0. 7 (tuna fish schools) ≤τ≤ 2. 95 (galaxies). We show that allelomimesis is a fundamental mechanism for adaptation that accurately explains why a broad spectrum of τ-values is observed in animate, human and inanimate cluster systems. Previous mathematical models could not account for the phenomenon. They are hampered by details and apply only to specific systems such as cities, business firms or gene family sizes. Allelomimesis is the tendency of an individual to imitate the actions of its neighbors and two cluster systems yield different τ values if their component agents display different allelomimetic tendencies.

Theoretical models predict that <b>blind</b> <b>copying</b> of others' behavior is more likely when individuals are only able to observe the decisions (here "social cues") of others rather than the cues (here "public information") on which such decisions are based. We investigated information use by nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) in a two-patch foraging context. Social cues were provided by the number of demonstrator fish present at each patch (two versus six), which either conflicted with the demonstrators' observed feeding rate at each patch (public information) or was the only information available. Consistent with predictions, observers preferred the patch previously associated with six demonstrators when social cues were the only available source of information but preferred the patch previously associated with two demonstrators ("rich" patch) when also provided with public information. On the bases of these experiments, we argue that it is because these fish preferentially base decisions on public information rather than social cues that they can potentially avoid engaging in erroneous informational cascades.
