50|$|NetVault Backup {{is based}} on a {{client-server}} architecture. A central NetVault <b>Backup</b> <b>Server</b> provides the job management, media management, device management, client management, reporting, notifications and logging functions. The NetVault <b>Backup</b> <b>Server</b> maintains a history of backups in the NetVault Backup database, enabling users to identify the object(s) they want to restore. NetVault Clients are “agents” that work with the NetVault <b>Backup</b> <b>Server</b> to back up and recover the respective servers, applications and data. The client software is installed on each machine to be protected. The NetVault WebUI enables centralized administration of a NetVault <b>Backup</b> <b>Server</b> from any browser.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{available}} server management in Internet connected network environments. The local <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> are hooked up by LAN and replace broken main server immediately and several different types of <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> are also considered. The remote <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> are hooked up by VPN (Virtual Private Network) with high-speed optical network. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) {{is a way to}} use a public network infrastructure and hooks up long-distance servers within a single network infrastructure. The remote <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> also replace broken main severs immediately under the different conditions with local backups. When the system performs a mandatory routine maintenance of main and local <b>backup</b> <b>servers,</b> auxiliary servers from other location are being used for backups during idle periods. Analytically tractable results are obtained by using several mathematical techniques and the results are demonstrated in the framework of optimized networked server allocation problems. The operational workflow give the guidelines for the actual implementations. </p...|$|R
50|$|On {{a backup}} network, {{there is no}} need for hosts to reach each other. Hosts should only reach their backup destination. Backup clients can be placed in one Isolated VLAN and the <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> can be placed as {{promiscuous}} on the Primary VLAN, this will allow hosts to communicate only with the <b>backup</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most {{customers}} {{also have}} a <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> in a remote location for disaster recovery. There are standard products to keep the data of the production and the <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> in sync, hence there is fast takeover and no data loss also in a disaster situation with the production server being disabled or destroyed.|$|E

5000|$|NDMP, or Network Data Management Protocol, is a {{protocol}} invented by the NetApp and PDC, acquired by Legato and now [...] EMC companies, meant to transport data between {{network attached storage}} (NAS) devices and backup devices. This removes the need for transporting the data through the <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> itself, thus enhancing speed and removing load from the <b>backup</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|A single <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>server</b> is {{assigned}} the standalone <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>server</b> role.

50|$|Large environments {{may contain}} {{multiple}} <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>servers</b> responsible for backing up many different client systems. <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>servers</b> in large environments can run independently {{of each other}} if each server is managed separately. Separate server management {{may not be an}} issue if there are only two or three <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>servers,</b> but it can become unwieldy as the environment grows. Backup Exec can centralize the management of multiple <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>servers</b> using an add-on option called the Backup Exec Central Admin Server Option (CASO). CASO ensures that everything throughout the network is protected by a single system that can be managed from one console and also balances the workload across all <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>servers</b> in the environment.|$|R

50|$|Similarly to the {{migration}} mechanism described above, failover allows the VM to continue operations if the host fails. However, in this case, the VM continues operation from the last-known coherent state, {{rather than the}} current state, based on whatever materials the <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> was last provided with.|$|E

50|$|A sender {{subjected}} to greylisting might {{move to a}} <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> and reattempt delivery. In order for greylisting to work in such cases, all backup mail servers (as specified by lower-priority MX records for the domain) should implement the same greylisting policy and share the same database. Traffic to those backup servers increases merely {{as a result of}} greylisting.|$|E
50|$|A {{workaround}} {{to this is}} {{to install}} temporary disk storage in the <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> {{to use as a}} cache for the backup process. This storage is split into hundreds of small 1-5 gigabyte data blocks. Backups to the data blocks can be done in parallel, and each of the separate disk-based backup jobs are configured to duplicate and append to tape when completed.|$|E
50|$|In a CASO environment, one <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>server</b> can be {{configured}} {{to be the}} Central Admin Server (CAS), {{while other}} Backup Execs become managed <b>Backup</b> Exec <b>servers</b> (MBESs) that are managed by the CAS.

50|$|Lustre {{file system}} high {{availability}} features include a robust failover and recovery mechanism, making server failures and reboots transparent. Version interoperability between successive minor {{versions of the}} Lustre software enables a server to be upgraded by taking it offline (or failing it over to a standby server), performing the upgrade, and restarting it, while all active jobs continue to run, experiencing a delay while the <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> takes over the storage.|$|E
5000|$|June 1993: Sybase announces {{its latest}} {{generation}} of software—named the System 10 product family; this {{consisted of the}} Database server, Replication Server for keeping replicate data up-to-date in near real time, and Navigation Server which had been developed in partnership with NCR to do shared nothing parallelisation across large numbers of databases. <b>Backup</b> <b>Server</b> was introduced to do high performance parallel backups and restores. SQL Monitor and SA Companion were provided to manage multiple servers.|$|E
40|$|A key {{strategy}} to build disaster-resilient clouds is to employ backups of virtual machines in a geo-distributed infrastructure. Today, the continuous and acknowledged replication of virtual machines in different servers is a service provided by different hypervisors. This strategy guarantees that the virtual machines {{will have no}} loss of disk and memory content if a disaster occurs, {{at a cost of}} strict bandwidth and latency requirements. Considering this kind of service, in this work, we propose an optimization problem to place servers in a wide area network. The goal is to guarantee that backup machines do not fail {{at the same time as}} their primary counterparts. In addition, by using virtualization, we also aim to reduce the amount of <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> required. The optimal results, achieved in real topologies, reduce the number of <b>backup</b> <b>servers</b> by at least 40 %. Moreover, this work highlights several characteristics of the backup service according to the employed network, such as the fulfillment of latency requirements. Comment: Computer Networks 201...|$|R

5000|$|Metastore: Stores {{metadata}} {{for each}} of the tables such as their schema and location. It also includes the partition metadata which helps the driver to track the progress of various data sets distributed over the cluster. The data is stored in a traditional RDBMS format. The metadata helps the driver to keep a track of the data and it is highly crucial. Hence, a <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> regularly replicates the data which can be retrieved in case of data loss.|$|E
50|$|Initial backups {{may take}} several hours via LAN or days over the internet, {{depending}} {{on the amount of}} data and bandwidth available, but afterwards, continuous and incremental backups are conducted without user intervention. Data is encrypted, password-protected and stored in a proprietary format. There is also an option for a more secure private key. Corporate users that have CrashPlan PROe back up to private servers instead of Code42's data centers in four out of five cases. The software has an option to create a private on-site <b>backup</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{techniques}} {{that are used}} in ARP spoofing {{can also be used to}} implement redundancy of network services. For example, some software allows a <b>backup</b> <b>server</b> to issue a gratuitous ARP request in order to take over for a defective server and transparently offer redundancy. There are two companies known to-date that have tried to commercialize products centered around this strategy, Disney Circle and CUJO. The latter has recently run into significant problems with its ARP-spoofing strategy in consumer's homes; they have now completely removed that capability and replaced it with a DHCP-based strategy.|$|E
