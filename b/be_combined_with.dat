5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea. It may <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E

50|$|In 1823, {{a portion}} of Seneca County <b>was</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> {{a portion of}} Ontario County to create Wayne County. The same year, a portion of Steuben County <b>was</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a portion of Ontario County to create Yates County.|$|R
50|$|One {{method of}} {{maintaining}} the effectiveness of individual strategies <b>is</b> to <b>combine</b> them <b>with</b> others that work in complete different ways. Thus seed targeting has <b>been</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> herbicides. In Australia seed management has <b>been</b> effectively <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> trifluralin and clethodim.|$|R
5|$|Beyond {{the letters}} themselves, {{there are a}} variety of {{secondary}} symbols which aid in transcription. Diacritic marks can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> IPA letters to transcribe modified phonetic values or secondary articulations. There are also special symbols for suprasegmental features such as stress and tone that are often employed.|$|E
5|$|Earth usually {{requires}} {{some sort of}} processing for use in construction. It may <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> water to make mud, straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement {{may be used to}} harden the earth, and the earth may be compacted to increase strength.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} the tumour is not easily {{accessible}} or is too large to ensure an optimal distribution of irradiation to the treatment area, brachytherapy can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> other treatments, such as EBRT and/or surgery. Combination therapy of brachytherapy exclusively with chemotherapy is rare.|$|E

50|$|In 1861 part of Watauga County <b>was</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> {{parts of}} Burke, Caldwell, McDowell, and Yancey {{counties}} to form Mitchell County. In 1911, the county {{was reduced to}} roughly its current size when portions of it <b>were</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> parts of Caldwell and Mitchell counties <b>were</b> <b>combined</b> to form Avery County.|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{teleportation}} can {{be performed}} {{if and only if}} a message <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a maximally entangled state. Bennett et al. originally claimed this feasibility condition. In this paper, I give a proof of that condition. Moreover, I specify the condition for teleportation when a single-qubit message <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a three-qubit state distributed among three parties. I also consider the situation that a single-qubit message <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> an $n$-qubit state distributed among $n$ parties. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author. Discussions in Sec. III and IV are wron...|$|R
5|$|Nethermost Pike {{also has}} an east ridge which gives an {{alternative}} route to Helvellyn from Grisedale, which many walkers overlook. It can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a scramble on Eagle Crag, or this part can be bypassed by taking the path to Nethermost Cove before joining the ridge.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy may <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> {{palliative care}} in the {{treatment}} of the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E

5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid vigour, and allows complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E
5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|Emissions {{of bonds}} are backed by {{guarantees}} {{given by the}} euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paid-up capital of the European Central Bank. The €440 billion lending capacity of the facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the eurozone countries' governments and may <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> loans up to €60 billion from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (reliant on funds raised by the European Commission using the EU budget as collateral) and up to €250 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to obtain a financial safety net up to €750 billion.|$|E

5|$|In 1965 Hornchurch Urban District was {{abolished}} and {{its former}} area was transferred from Essex to Greater London, to <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> {{that of the}} Municipal Borough of Romford in order to form the present-day London Borough of Havering. In 1993 the Greater London boundary, {{to the east of}} Cranham and north of the railway line, was locally realigned to the M25 motorway, returning some mostly unpopulated areas of open land to Essex and leaving North Ockendon as the only part of Greater London outside the bounds of the motorway.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{transport}} authorities began a {{feasibility study}} in 2006 {{to evaluate the}} introduction of congestion pricing. The charge would <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> other traffic reduction implementations, allowing money to be raised for public transit improvements and bike and pedestrian enhancements. The initial pricing scenarios were presented in public meetings conducted in December 2008, and the final study results were announced in November 2010, proposing modified alternatives based on the public's feedbacks, and the updated proposal calls for implementing a six-month to one-year trial in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Smallpeice {{arrived back}} in London during March 1964 and {{returned}} to meet with Cobbold, informing him of the offer with Cunard, a position which initially would be the management of Cunard's London operation, with a trip to Cunard's headquarters in Liverpool {{once a week for}} management and board meetings. Cobbold also had a job offer for Smallpeice, an accountancy position within the Queen's Household, a position formally to be titled Administrative Adviser. This position could <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> the work at Cunard quite comfortably, but would preclude taking further directorships in the short term, as a result, Smallpeice was forced to turn down non-executive director positions with Charterhouse Group and Rugby Portland Cement.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
