5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E

5|$|Liddy's revised Gemstone plan {{included}} {{a range of}} illegal activities, including a proposal to break into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex.

5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising. Reproduction for corporate use was similarly prohibited and such infractions were classified as offenses against public property. The 2003 Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding so as not to mislead the public into thinking that a commercial product has been endorsed by a government organization.|$|E

Fired from the P90, the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200m (219yd), or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing.|$|E
5000|$|Kent {{pleaded guilty}} in February 2009 to {{obstruction}} of justice for lying to a judicial committee investigating an allegation he sexually harassed an employee. He also acknowledged {{that he had had}} non-consensual sexual contact with two female employees between 2003 and 2007. He was sentenced on May 11, 2009, to serve 33 months in federal prison on the charge of obstructing justice in the investigation of the sexual abuse accusations. The obstruction charge carried a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison. As part of a plea agreement, Kent admitted that the sexual conduct was non-consensual. Kent had to pay a $1,000 fine and a total of $6,550 in restitution to the two victims. While in prison he was required {{to take part in the}} <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Prisons <b>Alcohol</b> Treatment Program. In pronouncing sentence over Kent, visiting Judge Roger Vinson stated, [...] "Your wrongful conduct is a huge black X ... a stain on the judicial system itself, a matter of concern in the federal courts". On June 15, 2009, Kent reported to the Federal Medical Center, Devens in Devens, Massachusetts to begin his sentence. In November 2009, he was moved to a state prison in Florida and held in solitary confinement for his own safety.|$|R

5|$|As part of {{his plea}} bargain, Bell pleaded guilty in July 1997 to {{collecting}} the names and home addresses of IRS employees, and the home addresses of FBI, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco and Firearms agents and police in Clark County, Washington; Bell also accepted responsibility for conducting a stinkbomb attack in the Vancouver IRS office. He was convicted of the two low-level felonies and sentenced in December 1997 to eleven months in prison followed by three years of federal probation. As a condition of his sentence, Bell was compelled to pay, upon his release, $1,359 in restitution for the stinkbomb attack. He was also subjected to three years of supervised release, during which he was barred from accessing computers and from possessing chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{investigations}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) were launched, {{and they}} interviewed witnesses, checked documentation, and conducted on-scene {{examination of the}} plant. OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours. Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

Special Agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) from the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Police {{seized a}} rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three pistols {{from the men}} {{at the time of the}} arrest. They were {{detained}} in Bells, Tennessee for a few days before being moved to another facility. During interrogation, the men told authorities of their plan to kill Obama. The <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives handled the initial federal investigation of the case. The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have found no evidence that anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 reward {{for information leading to}} the arrest of the perpetrator.

The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.|$|E
