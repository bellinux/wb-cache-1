5|$|A mutant who is {{the field}} leader of the X-Men and a teacher at Xavier's Institute, he shoots {{uncontrollable}} <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> concussive force from his eyes and wears a visor to control them. Cyclops is captured and brainwashed by Stryker. He is engaged to Jean.|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, {{is thought to be}} responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> a {{microwave}} antenna is dispersive, consequently the resolution becomes a function <b>of</b> range. The <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> an IR radar (laser) is non dispersive, the radar footprint is therefore independent of range.|$|R

50|$|Scientists {{use this}} <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> charged {{particles}} {{to determine the}} elemental composition of solid materials (minerals, glasses, metals). The chemical composition of the target can be found from the elemental data extracted through emitted X-rays (in the case where the primary <b>beam</b> consists <b>of</b> charged electrons) or measurement of an emitted secondary <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> material sputtered from the target (in the case where the primary <b>beam</b> consists <b>of</b> charged ions).|$|R
5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require {{manipulation of the}} Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Institut Laue–Langevin, Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> neutrons, measuring the neutron magnetic moment and finding a limit to its electric dipole moment. As President of the Universities Research Association during the 1960s {{he was involved in}} the design and construction of the Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. He also headed a 1982 National Research Council committee that concluded that, contrary to the findings of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations, that acoustic evidence did not indicate the presence of a second gunman's involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{mainstay}} of early Rydberg atom experiments relied on charge exchange between a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> ions and {{a population of}} neutral atoms of another species, resulting in the formation <b>of</b> a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> highly excited atoms, ...|$|R

During {{the dawn of the}} summer solstice (December 21) a months later, the last <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the Sun crosses the inverse way.|$|R
5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> matter are flung away into space at speeds near that of light.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, {{as far back as}} the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> light at targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
2500|$|Matter {{behaving}} as a wave {{was first}} demonstrated experimentally for electrons: a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> electrons can exhibit diffraction, {{just like a}} <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light or a water wave. [...] Similar wave-like phenomena were later shown for atoms and even molecules.|$|R

5|$|Progression through Shadow of the Colossus {{occurs in}} cycles. Beginning at a central point in an {{expansive}} landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is {{then returned to}} the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

5|$|In this work, the {{inscriptions}} are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature, and in {{some places}} seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult. Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated. The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the Book of Isaiah (53:6–9, 12), Revelations (20:13, 21:3–4) or the Book of Deuteronomy (32:23–24). In the right hand panel, {{the wings of the}} figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words CHAOS MAGNVM ("great chaos"), with UMBRA MORTIS ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right. A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> light seemingly hurled from the heavens. Also in the section are letters reading ME OBVLIVI.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The mosque's {{interior}} {{is supported by}} 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.|$|E

50|$|The Telstar 26 MK 3 is {{a further}} {{development}} of the MK 2. The improvements included an increase in <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the main hull to improve the interior volume.

25|$|When a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light {{crosses the}} {{boundary}} between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light is not orthogonal (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in {{a change in the}} direction <b>of</b> the <b>beam.</b> This change <b>of</b> direction is known as refraction.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} myths {{regarding}} {{the construction of}} the Faidherbe Bridge which are present even today and are depicted in some tourist guides. The construction of the bridge is attributed to Gustave Eiffel. In general it says that the metallic parts of the bridge represents a gift from the French government and that the parts were originally designed for the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube River in Romania. Other sources say that the metallic parts were intended for a bridge in Austria–Hungary over the Danube River in Vienna or Budapest. Finally another myth regarding the <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the bridge says that the parts were intended for an unspecified site but the vessel transporting mysteriously sunk and the authorities in Senegal took advantage of this situation and built a local bridge.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, Doria {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 54mph (87km/h) and storm tides 5.3feet (1.6m) above normal in Atlantic City. The outer bands of the storm spawned an F2 tornado near Cape May. It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971USD, $ USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47km) path. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29inches (261mm) in Little Falls. Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84inches (199mm) and Trenton with 7.55inches (192mm). The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state. The Beden Brook crested at over 5feet (1.5m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton. The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8feet (3m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The heavy rainfall overtopped the levee system in Zarephath, causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening {{in the fall of}} 1971. The rainfall also flooded two fire houses in Somerville with several feet of water, and the water treatment plant in Bridgewater Township with 18inches (457mm) of floodwaters in what was catalogued as a 50-year flood event. Following the flooding to the water treatment plant, officials raised the <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the plant to withstand a 500-year flood event. Eleven houses experienced flooding damage in Montgomery Township. Doria killed three people and caused $138million in damage (1971USD) in the state.|$|E
