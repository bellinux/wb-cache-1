50|$|In {{common with}} the whole Networker fleet, wheel slide {{protection}} (WSP) operates on every axle. Under braking conditions a <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve</b> releases air from the brake cylinder of any axle if the rotational speed varies significantly from the average axle speed on the train.|$|E
50|$|By pumping {{slightly}} more water in {{than can be}} evaporated, the output {{was a mixture of}} steam and a bit of water with concentrated dissolved solids. A steam separator removed the water before the steam was fed to the train. An automatic <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve</b> would be periodically cycled to eject solids and sludge from the separator. This reduced limescale buildup caused by boiling hard water. Scale build-up that occurred had to be removed with acid washouts.|$|E
50|$|The four Nelson {{locomotives}} {{were never}} fitted with superheaters. Instead, they were equipped with smokebox <b>blowdown</b> <b>valves</b> {{on the right-hand}} side of the locomotive, the only NZR locomotives to be fitted with this modification. This was intended to increase the steaming capacity of the locomotives, making it easier to eject the ash, cinders and soot that would collect in the smokeboxes of the locomotives. A small port on the left-hand side of the smokebox was opened to assist this process, allowing one of the crew to brush down the smokebox and clean the spark arrestor.|$|R
50|$|Prior to each 'Leaf fall season' many train {{companies}} arrange low adhesion {{training for}} their newly qualified drivers. This consists of taking over {{a section of}} line during a quiet period. Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a Full Service brake under normal adhesion conditions. The railhead is then treated with a contaminant that has a low coefficient of friction. On the second run the driver will experience the sound and sensation of the WSP activating and operating <b>blowdown</b> <b>valves</b> on the brake cylinders, and the stopping distance will be considerably greater.|$|R
5000|$|Modern WSP {{systems are}} {{microprocessor}} controlled and employ two stage valves that permit fine {{control over the}} air pressure in the brake cylinders. This is essential {{to be able to}} capture and control a sliding wheel and to minimise the amount of air resource used by the WSP. When the brake is applied, the WSP first applies the dynamic brake. If that is not successful it then “blends” the friction and dynamic braking systems. If control is still not established the system reverts to friction braking only where <b>blowdown</b> <b>valves</b> rapidly cycle the air in the brake cylinders [...] Examples of this kind of equipment are manufactured by Knorr Bremse (EP compact, EP2002) Faiveley Transport (EPAC) and POLI Wabtec (ATHENA).|$|R
50|$|Bottom {{blowdown}} piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve.</b> The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on emission formation processes, such as particulate, nitric oxide and total hydrocarbon, {{in a small}} D. I. diesel engine {{was carried out by}} using a newly developed total in-cylinder sampling technique. The sampling method was composed of rapidly opening a <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve</b> attached {{to the bottom of the}} piston cavity, and quickly transferring most of the in-cylinder contents into a large sampling chamber below the piston. The sampling experiment gave a history of spatially averaged emission concentrations in the cylinder. The effects of several engine variables on the emission formation processes were investigated...|$|E
40|$|During the {{generation}} of steam, most water impurities are not evaporated with the steam and thus concentrate in the boiler water. The concentration of the impurities is usually regulated by the adjustment of the continuous <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve,</b> which controls {{the amount of water}} (and concentrated impurities) purged from the steam drum. Since a certain amount of continuous blowdown must be maintained for satisfactory boiler performance, a significant quantity of heat is removed from the boiler. It is necessary to provide a simple-to-use method to calculate the total amount of heat that is recoverable using this system. In the present work, a simple-to-use predictive tool, which is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations and minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps, is formulated to arrive at an appropriate estimation of the percent of blowdown that is flashed to steam as a function of flash drum pressure and operating boiler drum pressure followed by the calculation of the amount of heat recoverable from the condensate. Since all of the heat in the flashed steam is recoverable, the total percent of heat recoverable from the flash tank and heat-exchanger system is calculated in the final step. Results show that the proposed predictive tool has a very good agreement with the reported data wherein the average absolute deviation percent was observed to be around 1. 47 %...|$|E
50|$|Early {{designers}} fitted curved sheets {{below the}} steam collector pipe, {{but these were}} not successful as {{the whole of the}} steam space could contain foam. In districts where the feed water is unsuitable, <b>blowdown</b> <b>valves</b> ("scum valves"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed, are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove precipitated solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the cylinder cocks, which are designed to release trapped water. Once occurring, the problem can affect the level indicated in the boiler's gauge glass and for this reason is difficult to put right without reducing the water level {{to the extent that the}} firebox crown becomes dangerously exposed.|$|R

40|$|Safety-instrumented {{systems are}} {{implemented}} in the industry to prevent accidents to occur and escalate. The blowdown system on a oil production ship {{is one example of}} such system. If a fire breaks out on the ship, the blowdown system's role is to remove the flammable gases from the current production lines on the ship. This is done by opening of the <b>blowdown</b> <b>valves,</b> that are installed on the different production lines. In this thesis, the blowdown system on a new Teekay ship, and espesically the valves, are applied as case. Since such systems are imporant to maintain the safety on the installation, they are subject to strict reliability performance requirements. Before the SIS is put into operation, it is required to state a certain reliability target for the system. At present, Teekay estimates the reliability based on generic reliability data or reliability data provided from the manufacturer of the equipment. There are uncertainties related to both of these sources. Generic reliability data are collected from different installations where the equipment are operating under different conditions and environment. The reliability is affected by its surroundings, and the generic data then reflects the average reliability in the entire industry. This implies that this data may not be accurate for equipment on a new ship, which has brand new equipment. The manufacturer data, on the other hand are tested under controlled conditions, typically in a laboratory. This implies that the reliability reflects how the equipment performs when it is applied just as intended by the manufacturer. In industry, the equipment will most likely be handled more thoughly, and failures can be introduced during for example, maintenance. This thesis suggests a new way of predicting the reliability. The estimated reliability is based on the mentioned sources, in addition to reliability data collected from the other ships in the Teekay fleet. By using expert opinions (e. g., opinions from operators and engineers) these sources are weighted to create a best possible estimate of the reliability. From these estimates, a probability distribution is constructed. This distribution states how likely the different estimates of the reliability are, where the thesis suggests to choose a rather conservative estimate even if it is not the most likely estimate. After the system is put into operation, failure data becomes available from operation and testing. This data constitutes a reliability estimate based on operational data alone. Since safety systems are designed to be highly reliable, few failures occur and this estimate is uncertain. Because of this, the thesis provides a method on how the operational data can be included in the probability distribution constructed in the design phase. As more operational data become available, the less is the contribution from the design phase assumptions. If it comes to a point where the operational data proves that the reliability of the system differs significantly from what was assumed, it can be assessed whether the regular testing of the system can or should be changed. This thesis suggests that only operational data should be applied to decide such a change. A point which indicates that a sufficient amount of operational data is collected to trust this estimate solely, is provided. Teekay performs annual testing on the entire blowdown system where the results are recorded and applied in further reliability calculations. In addition to these test, they perform monthly manual testing on the <b>blowdown</b> <b>valves.</b> This is because the valves fail more often than the other parts, and the operators on the ship {{want to be sure that}} they are functioning. It is shown how these tests influence on the average availability of the valves, and it is discussed how these tests can be applied as a means to increase the length between the more comprehensive annual tests. The last part of the thesis investigates the uncertainty aspects related to the provided methods, models, and other relevant aspects in the process of collecting and applying reliability data. It is shown that there are a high degree of uncertainty related to all the aspects. Application of generic reliability data is a high contributor to uncertainty. The thesis provides a method on how the generic data can be compared to the data collected in Teekay. This comparison aims at providing a factor which reflects how the specific conditions on Teekay ships influences the reliability, compared to the average reliability found in generic data sources. </p...|$|R
40|$|Compressors {{are used}} {{throughout}} the natural gas industry to move natural gas from production and processing sites to customer distribution systems. Compressors must periodically be taken off-line for maintenance, operational stand-by, or emergency shut down testing, and as a result, methane may be released to the atmosphere {{from a number of}} sources. When compressor units are shut down, typically the high pressure gas remaining within the compressors and associated piping between isolation valves is vented to the atmosphere (‘blowdown’) or to a flare. In addition to blowdown emissions, a depressurized system may continue to leak gas from faulty or improperly sealed unit isolation valves. Natural Gas STAR Partners have found that simple changes in operating practices and in the design of blowdown systems can save money and significantly reduce methane emissions by keeping systems fully or partially pressurized during shutdown. Though pressurized systems may also leak from the closed <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve</b> and from reciprocating compressor rod packing, total emissions can be significantly reduced. Four options for reducing emissions when taking compressors off-line are discussed in this paper. These include: ��Keeping compressors pressurized when off-line. ��Connecting blowdown vent lines to the fuel gas system and recovering all, or a portion, of the vented gas to the fuel gas system. ��Installing static seals on compressor rod packing. ��Installing ejectors on compressor blowdown vent lines. Keeping compressors fully pressurized when off-line achieves immediate payback—there are no capital costs and emissions are avoided by reducing the net leakage rate. Routing blowdown vent lines to the fuel gas system or to a lower pressure gas line reduces fuel costs for the compressor or other facility equipment, in addition t...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have {{identified}} {{health and safety}} risks to workers who manually gauge or sample fluids on production and flowback tanks from exposure to hydrocarbon gases and vapors, exposure to oxygen-deficient atmospheres, {{and the potential for}} fires and explosions. This Hazard Alert describes the safety and health hazards when workers manually gauge or sample fluids from production, flowback, or other tanks. It recommends ways to protect workers by eliminating or reducing exposures to hazardous atmospheres, and actions employers should take to ensure that workers are properly aware of the hazards and protected from exposure to hydrocarbon gases and vapors. This alert is a supplement to the OSHA Alliance Tank Hazard Alert released in 2015 [National STEPS Network 2015]. NIOSH and OSHA also identified nine worker fatalities that occurred while workers manually gauged or sampled production tanks from 2010 - 2014 [NIOSH 2015]. Exposures to hydrocarbon gases and vapors and/or oxygen-deficient atmospheres are believed to be primary or contributory factors to the workers' deaths [Harrison et al. 2016]. NIOSH & OSHA Recommendations for Manual Tank Gauging and Fluid Sample Collection: 1. Implement alternative tank gauging and sampling procedures that enable workers to monitor tank fluid levels and take samples without opening the tank hatch. 2. Retrofit existing tanks with dedicated sampling ports (i. e., tank sampling taps [American Petroleum Institute 2013]) that minimize worker exposures to hydrocarbon gases and vapors, thereby eliminating the need to routinely open thief hatches to sample. These sampling taps should minimize the magnitude of hydrocarbon plumes and should limit the need for workers to access the top of tanks. 3. Install thief hatch pressure indicators to provide an immediate visual indicator of tank pressures and potential hazards. Pressure indicators can show workers the pressure in the tank and allow a trained worker to follow appropriate procedures, such as actuating a <b>blowdown</b> <b>valve,</b> venting gas to a flare, or using appropriate respiratory protection, such as a self-contained breathing apparatus or an air-line respirator. 4. Conduct worker exposure assessments to determine exposure risks to volatile hydrocarbons and other contaminants. Employers may consult an occupational safety and health professional trained and certified in industrial hygiene and who has knowledge and experience with combined flammable gas and vapor exposures to ensure that an appropriate air-sampling strategy is used. 5. Provide hazard communication training in a language that employees understand to ensure that general site workers, tank gaugers and samplers, water haulers, drivers, and others who open tank hatches understand the hazards associated with opening tanks and the precautions necessary to conduct this work safely. These hazards include reduced oxygen environments, flammability hazards and possible ignition sources, and the potential for concentrations of hydrocarbons that can approach or exceed IDLH concentrations. Post hazard signage at access stairs, catwalks, and/or tanks to alert workers about the hazards associated with opening thief hatches and precautions that must be taken. 6. Ensure that workers are trained on - and correctly and consistently use - calibrated multi-gas and oxygen monitors that measure percent LEL and oxygen concentration. Workers should understand the limitations of these monitors as well as appropriate actions to take whenever an alarm occurs or they experience health symptoms (e. g., leave the hazard area, report symptoms to supervisors). 7. Do not permit employees to work alone when tank gauging or working around tanks, thief hatches, or other areas where they may encounter process fluids. Observers should be trained on proper rescue procedures and be stationed outside potentially hazardous areas. 8. As an interim measure, where remote gauging or sampling is not feasible or engineering controls are not implemented, (a) train workers in proper work practices, such as tank-opening procedures, that can minimize risks for exposures, (b) ensure intrinsic safety by proper grounding and prohibiting the use of spark producing devices or equipment, (c) establish administrative controls {{to reduce the number of}} times throughout a shift a worker is required to manually gauge tanks, (d) safely reduce tank pressure prior to gauging, and (e) use appropriate respiratory protection, including a supplied air respirator (SAR) and/or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in areas where IDLH VOC exposures may occur (i. e., during manual tank gauging/sampling). Employers should consult with a trained occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate respirator to be used. NIOSH guidance for selecting respirators is at: [URL] 9. Wear flame-resistant clothing to protect against burns from fires and explosions. Also, use appropriate impermeable gloves to limit risks for skin exposures to chemicals (e. g., benzene). 10. Establish and practice emergency procedures to provide on-scene, immediate medical response in the event of an incident, such as a collapsed worker, or workers experiencing symptoms of chemical overexposures or exposure to an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.

40|$|AbstractThe {{two phase flow}} of air {{and water}} is studied in a safety relief valve {{commonly}} used in the industrial refrigeration industry. In some <b>blowdown</b> conditions a <b>valve</b> which has been specified for gas only operation may encounter flows which include liquid droplets, these having been entrained from upstream processes. Of particular interest is the operation under two phase flow conditions which will be dominated by the altered flow capacity and forces acting on the valve. To examine these effects {{the characteristics of the}} flow through the valve and the forces acting on the valve disc have been examined for an air water mixtures for a range of pressures, 5 - 14 bar, and a wide range of gas mass fractions for various different opening positions. These characteristics determine the capacity of the valve to control pressure, the sizing of the spring and the dynamics of the valve during operation. The data on such effects for safety valves is very limited and here we show the trends that result from the introduction of two phase flow mixtures and reflect on the limited previous work in the literature that is available. The tested range of conditions the results indicate that the flow and force characteristics are influenced by liquid injection with a significant influence on the flowrate. The disc forces resulting from the two phase impacts show a small but notable effect from liquid mass fractions. This is in contrast to previous limited data found in the literature...|$|R
