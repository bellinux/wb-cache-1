5|$|The Sihanaka {{share the}} belief common {{throughout}} the island that {{the spirits of}} ancestors can possess the living, placing them in a trance state called a tromba. The Sihanaka traditionally believe that looking at a cuckoo roller (an indigenous bird) will induce the tromba. Communities look to ombiasy (wise men) for spiritual guidance, to commune with the ancestors, and to determine which days are auspicious for undertaking particular tasks or endeavors. By the 1600s, a uniform religious <b>belief</b> <b>system</b> had grown around a group of sampy (idols) believed to channel the protective spiritual power of 11 deities. The origin of these amulets {{is said to have}} been in the western territories under Sakalava control.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their <b>belief</b> <b>system</b> to the jury.|$|E
5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held {{a variety of}} beliefs in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no evidence}} of a unified <b>belief</b> <b>system</b> shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E

5|$|Built out {{of earth}} and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow {{consisted}} of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the Early Neolithic. Osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals, a mixture of men, women, children and adults. At least one of the bodies had been dismembered before burial, potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial. As with other barrows, Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead, perhaps as part of a <b>belief</b> <b>system</b> involving ancestor veneration, although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious, ritual, and cultural connotations and uses.|$|E
5|$|The gospel Epiphanius {{attributed}} to the Ebionites is a valuable source of information that provides modern scholars with insights into the distinctive characteristics of a vanished branch of Jewish Christianity. However, scholars disagree on whether the information contained within the seven fragments preserved by Epiphanius accurately reflects {{the traditions of the}} second-century Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus, or if their <b>belief</b> <b>system</b> changed, perhaps greatly, over a span of 200 years compared to this early group. The Ebionites known to Irenaeus (first mentioned in Adversus Haereses 1.26.2, written around 185) and other Church Fathers prior to Epiphanius were described as a Jewish sect that regarded Jesus as the Messiah but not as divine. They insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites and they used only the Jewish–Christian gospel. The Ebionites rejected the epistles of Paul of Tarsus, whom they regarded as an apostate from the Law.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the <b>belief</b> <b>system</b> through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{shed light}} on the role of religious, spiritual and secular beliefs in individuals’ {{recovery}} from problematic substance use in Scotland. The findings are based on semi-structured interviews with twenty individuals, living in Scotland, who had past experience of problematic substance use. The methodology was influenced by narrative theory and the analysis drew on a thematic narrative approach. It is suggested that individuals in recovery construct personal <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> by drawing chiefly on established cultural <b>belief</b> <b>systems.</b> Personal <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> are learned and reinforced through practice, notably, engaging with belief-orientated communities and practising personal rituals. Participants use their personal <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> as frameworks to interpret and give meaning to fundamental experiences that were part of their recovery. Personal <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> are also integral to the construction of identity in recovery, helping individuals to establish a new self or reclaim an idealised past self. While personal <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> did not often fit within neat religious, spiritual or secular categories, those with religious and/or spiritual beliefs often stressed the importance of their beliefs and associated practices to their recovery. Secular existential beliefs were also important to some people. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of research, policy and practice...|$|R

The second is the central focus of their mythology on human blood, which signified life among the Maya. Within their <b>belief</b> <b>system,</b> human blood was partially made up of the blood of the gods, who sacrificed their own divine blood in creating life in humans. Thus, in order to continually maintain the order of their universe, the Maya believed that blood had to be given back to the gods.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine a hypothetical model regarding influences of sociostructural determinants, collaborative decision-making and patient's <b>beliefs</b> <b>system</b> on diabetes self-management. Methods: In a cross-sectional descriptive study from Dec 2010 to Mar 2010, 500 patients of Iranian adult patients with type II diabetes attended the outpatient diabetic clinics of the Shariati Hospital in Tehran were selected by convenience sampling. Data were collected by The Demographical Information, Social- Economical Status and Diabetic History Questionnaire and eleven self-reported scales of this research. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with LIZREL software applied for data analysis. Results: The modified model had a desirable fitness to the observed data.
