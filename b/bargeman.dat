2500|$|The bout {{was set for}} 13 November 1815. [...] Once again, {{it was to be}} staged at Donnelly's Hollow on the Curragh in County Kildare. [...] News of Napoleon's {{defeat at}} Waterloo was resounding around Europe. [...] George Cooper was a hotter {{favorite}} than the Iron Duke had been in his bout with the Little Corporal. [...] Cooper was a <b>bargeman</b> with a fearful reputation. [...] He was of gypsy blood and he was 10/1 on to batter Dan Donnelly.|$|E
2500|$|Unknown to Dyer, on 30 March 1896, {{a package}} was {{retrieved}} from the Thames at Reading by a <b>bargeman.</b> [...] The package Dyer dumped was not weighted adequately, {{and had been}} easily spotted. It contained {{the body of a}} baby girl, later identified as Helena Fry. In the small detective force available to Reading Borough Police, Detective Constable Anderson made a crucial [...] breakthrough. As well as finding a label from Temple Meads station, Bristol, he used microscopic analysis of the wrapping paper, and deciphered a faintly legible name—Mrs Thomas—and an address.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many regions}} of England {{there are few}} {{distinctive}} local instruments and many songs were shared {{with the rest of}} Britain and with Ireland, although the distinct dialects of the regions sometimes lent them a particular stamp and, with one of the longest coastlines of any English region, songs about the sea were also particularly important. Along with the West Country, {{this was one of the}} regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century. [...] Also like the West Country it is one of the few regions where there is still an active tradition of step dancing and like the Midlands the tradition of Molly dance died out in the 1930s. The region was relatively neglected by folk song collectors of the first revival. Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp collected in Cambridgeshire, as did and Vaughan Williams as well as in Norfolk and Essex from 1905, but most important regional figure was composer Ernest John Moeran, who collected over 150 songs in Norfolk and Suffolk in the 1920s. The second folk revival led to the discovery of many East Anglian folk musicians, including Suffolk melodeon player Oscar Woods, Norfolk singers Sam Larner (1878–1965), Harry Cox (1885–1971) and Walter Pardon (1914–96); Suffolk fiddler Harkie Nesling (1890–1978); Suffolk singer and <b>bargeman</b> Bob Roberts (1907–82), many of whom recorded for Topic Records. Perhaps the most influential folk dance musical album was English Country Dance Music (1965), put together by Reg Hall and Bob Davenport with largely Norfolk musicians, it was the first instrumental recording of folk instruments. Also from Norfolk was Peter Bellamy, who in solo projects, with the Young Tradition and in theatrical productions was probably one of the most influential musicians of the post revival period. The Norfolk melodeon player and singer Tony Hall has given the tradition a unique style. East Anglia made a contribution to the British folk rock scene of the 1970s, producing the short-lived, but more recently reformed, bands Midwinter and Stone Angel, based in Great Yarmouth and the more successful Spriguns of Tolgus from Cambridge, who produced four albums. The most successful folk artists from the region in recent years are probably the Essex born Billy Bragg and the Norfolk born Beth Orton. The region is home to numerous folk clubs and hosts many folk festivals, including Steeleye Span’s Spanfest at Kentwell Hall, Suffolk and the Cambridge Folk Festival, generally seen as the most prestigious in the calendar. Since 2000 the East Anglian Traditional Music Trust has been promoting folk music in the region, organising a ‘Traditional Music Day’ every year in August.|$|E

60|$|Of {{course there}} was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe liked {{sometimes}} to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders from my sister to call {{for him at the}} Three Jolly <b>Bargemen,</b> that evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the Three Jolly <b>Bargemen,</b> therefore, I directed my steps.|$|R
50|$|The Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and <b>Bargemen</b> was a {{trade union}} in the United Kingdom.|$|R
60|$|The <b>bargeman</b> turned back. Approaching nearer and nearer, the <b>bargeman</b> became Bradley Headstone, {{in rough}} water-side {{second-hand}} clothing.|$|E
60|$|So one {{of those}} to whom he spake {{took him to a}} certain place where was that barge, and the deaf and dumb <b>bargeman.</b> And the <b>bargeman</b> was a very old man with a long beard as white as snow and he gazed very steadfastly upon Sir Lavaine as he drew near thitherward. So Sir Lavaine came close to the <b>bargeman</b> and he made signs to him, asking him if he would ferry him down the stream to the King's town, and the dumb <b>bargeman</b> {{understood}} what Sir Lavaine would have and he made signs in answer that it should be as Sir Lavaine desired.|$|E
60|$|The <b>bargeman</b> and {{his wife}} gazed {{at each other in}} astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... [ROBERTS {{faces the}} crowd, probing {{them with his}} eyes till they [...] {{gradually}} become silent. He begins speaking. One of the [...] <b>bargemen</b> rises and stands.] ...|$|R
60|$|Something {{came into}} my head which induced me to run after him, as he was {{going down to the}} Jolly <b>Bargemen,</b> where he had left a hired carriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, young men, however did {{you manage}} to get here?" [...] one of the <b>bargemen</b> asked. [...] "It's lucky for you you weren't taken out to sea with the tide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [EVANS {{throws up}} his arm at a threat from BULGIN. The <b>bargeman,</b> [...] who has lighted the lantern, holds it high above his head.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{very much}} fear so,' said Boots; 'as how the <b>bargeman</b> {{who told me}} saw Mr. Coningsby in the Lock House laid out in flannels.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then the <b>bargeman</b> trimmed {{the sail}} {{and so the}} barge drew slowly away from that place, many {{standing}} upon the landing-stage and watching its departure.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the chapel}} {{is still a}} parish for the <b>bargemen,</b> {{but it is also}} a place for help by {{services}} intended for freshwater marines but for people on land, as well.|$|R
6000|$|Ten miles, as he computed, {{from where}} {{he had left the}} <b>bargemen,</b> leisurely passing a public house of a little village on the roadside, {{thinking}} himself now pretty safe--hark, what is this he hears?-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... [EVANS {{throws up}} his fists, parries the blow, and returns it. [...] They fight. The <b>bargemen</b> are seen {{holding up the}} lantern and [...] enjoying the sight. Old THOMAS steps forward and holds out his [...] hands.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wentworth {{told me that}} he {{was afraid}} Buckhurst was drowned. He heard it at the Brocas; a <b>bargeman</b> told him about a quarter of an hour ago.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a-coming, sure enough," [...] the <b>bargeman</b> said. [...] "I'd bet {{a pot of}} beer as the fog {{will have}} lifted in {{a quarter of an}} hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} one, miss; {{you can come}} and look at it. That is where the second hand always sleeps when the <b>bargeman</b> has got his wife on board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>bargemen</b> {{generally}} like {{a bit of}} a flag, that is to say if {{they take}} any pride in their boat. You cannot trade in the barge until you have had it registered; shall I get that done for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that {{it could}} be in anywise {{necessary}} to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly <b>Bargemen</b> to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes,--"well--no. No, he ain't." ...|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the fourth}} year of my {{apprenticeship}} to Joe, {{and it was a}} Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly <b>Bargemen,</b> attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud. Of that group I was one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jump {{into the}} boat, boys," [...] the good-natured <b>bargeman</b> said; [...] "I will put you ashore at once. There is the station {{close to the}} end of the bridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|If, in so doing, he {{took another}} glance at the <b>bargeman,</b> he did it by stealth. He cast himself on the grass by the Lock side, in an {{indolent}} way, with his back in that direction, and, having gathered a few blades, fell to chewing them. The dip of Eugene Wrayburn's sculls had become hardly audible in his ears when the <b>bargeman</b> passed him, putting the utmost width that he could between them, and keeping under the hedge. Then, Riderhood sat up {{and took a long}} look at his figure, and then cried: 'Hi--I--i! Lock, ho! Lock! Plashwater Weir Mill Lock!' ...|$|E
60|$|Riderhood nodded, and {{the figure}} of the <b>bargeman</b> went its way along the soft turf {{by the side of the}} towing-path, keeping near the hedge and moving quickly. They had turned a point from which a long stretch of river was visible. A {{stranger}} to the scene might have been certain that here and there along the line of hedge a figure stood, watching the <b>bargeman,</b> and waiting for him to come up. So he himself had often believed at first, until his eyes became used to the posts, bearing the dagger that slew Wat Tyler, in the City of London shield.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{hastened to}} the shore and ordered <b>bargemen</b> to row him downriver to where HMS Vulture was anchored, which then took him to New York. From the ship, Arnold {{wrote a letter to}} Washington, {{requesting}} that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia, a request that Washington granted.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} villagers were in {{the main}} farm workers, but some <b>bargemen</b> and mill workers also lived in the village. In the late 19th century, industrial mill workers became more commonplace in the village, and the first furniture makers and workers began to settle too, with Flackwell Heath's close proximity to High Wycombe - well known for the Chair and Furniture industry.|$|R
50|$|Then Vernon Harvey {{bought the}} barge from trade {{and she was}} re-rigged with the gear from the famous racing barge, Veronica when her career ended in 1963. Regarded as a latter day racing Queen, the Edith May {{dominated}} the Sailing Barge Matches of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s {{and to this day}} her reputation is still revered amongst <b>bargemen.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} the whole town was talking of the affair, and in the {{afternoon}} the <b>bargeman</b> {{went up to the}} head-master and accused one of the boys of an attempt to murder him.|$|E
60|$|The <b>bargeman</b> {{looked down}} into the water and frowned. He was slow of speech, but as the minutes went on and he did not {{absolutely}} refuse the boys exchanged glances of excitement and hope.|$|E
60|$|But {{one bright}} morning, Israel is hailed from the deck. A <b>bargeman</b> of the commander's boat is sick. Known for a sailor, Israel for the nonce is {{appointed}} {{to pull the}} absent man's oar.|$|E
2500|$|Horace Walpole entered Eton in 1726 {{and later}} wrote that [...] "playing cricket {{as well as}} {{thrashing}} <b>bargemen</b> was common". The Sackville family which produced the Dukes of Dorset, most notably the 3rd Duke, sent its sons to Westminster, the 1st Duke studying {{there at the end}} of the 17th century; and it was through playing cricket at school that the game became a Sackville family tradition.|$|R
60|$|The soft {{movement}} of the barge upon the water had a soothing influence; and he was certainly in a less suffering state, though silent and dreamy, as he lay half raised on cushions under an awning, James anxiously watching over him, and Malcolm with a few other attendants near at hand; stout <b>bargemen</b> propelling the craft, and the guard keeping along {{the bank of the}} river.|$|R
50|$|One of his {{earliest}} film roles {{was in the}} Carol Reed's film musical of Lionel Bart's Oliver!, he played one of the London Bridge <b>bargemen</b> - a small uncredited speaking part. His other film roles included Burke & Hare (1971), the 1972 film Made (1972) starring Carol White, the comedy short The Waterloo Bridge Handicap (1978), A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (1979), Deadly Game (1982), Scrubbers (1983) and Underworld (1985).|$|R
