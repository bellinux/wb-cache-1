5|$|Gliese 3634 (Often {{shortened}} to GJ 3634) is a {{red dwarf}} star in the Hydra constellation. One planet has been discovered in its orbit, Gliese 3634 b. GJ 3634 is under half the mass {{and size of the}} Sun, and is estimated to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> billion years younger, and lies near to Earth, with a distance of 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years). It was targeted by astronomers during an over six-year survey of red dwarfs. The astronomers had recently changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits so they could narrow down candidates that transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from the Earth. The Super-Earth GJ 3634 b was the first planet discovered using this new strategy. The planet was confirmed using Doppler spectroscopy, or the observation and extrapolation of data from a recorded Doppler effect in the star's light, but later observations found no transiting pattern. The planet was published by its discoverers on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the clique problem has led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> polynomial in the clique size.|$|E

25|$|The law of {{treasure}} trove in the United States varies {{from state to}} state, but certain general conclusions may be drawn. To be {{treasure trove}}, an object must be of gold or silver. Paper money is also deemed to be treasure trove since it previously represented gold or silver. On the same reasoning, it might be imagined that coins and tokens in metals other than gold or silver are also included, but this {{has yet to be}} clearly established.

25|$|Not all {{cardinals}} are bishops. Domenico Bartolucci, Karl Josef Becker, Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye {{are examples}} of 21st-century non-bishop cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law introduced the requirement that a cardinal must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> priest. Previously, they need only be in minor orders and not even deacons. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was the last non-priest cardinal. In 1962, Pope John XXIII made it a rule {{that a man who}} has been nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already, but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement. It is rare that the Pope will appoint Cardinals who are priests only and not consecrated as a bishop.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} the Danube Sich reached its height, {{numbering}} 10,000-15,000 men, and controlling all of the Danube delta region with six villages being in personal control of the Kosh. In the Upper Dunavets there were 38 kurens under old traditional names of the Zaporozhian Sich. However, the new Sich was noticeably different from its predecessor. There were no longer any Host Starshynas, and only un-married Cossacks were considered as eligible for service. Polkovnyks were assigned temporarily by the Kosh. The Host lacked any cavalry, only infantry in boats. The social structure also began to fragment; instead of the former equality of all Cossacks, many fishing, tradesmen and landowners became the Rayah. In order to gain permission to do so, there had to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> marriage link to a Cossack family.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of 52 rests both upon its proposed early dating and upon its geographic dispersal from the presumed site of authorship, traditionally {{thought to have}} been Ephesus. As the fragment is removed from the autograph by at least one step of transmission, the date of authorship for the Gospel of John must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> few years prior to the writing of 52, whenever that may have been. The location of the fragment in Egypt extends that time even further, allowing for the dispersal of the documents from the point of authorship and transmission to the point of discovery. The Gospel of John is perhaps quoted by Justin Martyr, and hence is highly likely to have been written before c. 160 CE; but 20th century New Testament scholars, most influentially Kurt Aland and Bruce Metzger, have argued from the proposed dating of 52 prior to this, that the latest possible date for the composition of the Gospel should be pushed back into {{the early decades of the}} second century; some scholars indeed arguing that the discovery of 52 implies a date of composition for the Gospel no later than the traditionally accepted date of c. 90 CE, or even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Requiring {{the task}} force commander's {{permission}} to send out the relief force and to accompany it, Townsend telephoned Jackson. Concerned {{for the safety of}} the entire force, Jackson was initially reluctant to authorise its dispatch should it weaken the position at Nui Dat. Although he was unsure of the size of the Viet Cong facing D Company, from Smith's reports it appeared to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> regular battalion. Intelligence suggested it was likely from the 275th Regiment, although the location of its remaining two battalions were unknown, as was that of D445 Battalion. The whereabouts of the 274th Regiment was equally unclear. While radio direction finding suggested it may have been near Phuoc Tuy's northern border, three weeks earlier it had been reported close to the western side of the Australian TAOR, and one of its battalions had (incorrectly) been believed involved in an attack on Phu My in the south-west of the province on 11 August. Consequently, Jackson reasoned that if the battle unfolding near Long Tan was the opening phase of an attack on Nui Dat the main assault was still to come, and he would need the bulk of his forces to defend {{the task force}} base. He considered the commitment of A Company would tie up the bulk of 6 RAR and the artillery. Yet Townsend believed Nui Dat's defences sufficient to deter such an attack, even if they remained incomplete, while the strategic reserve held by US II FFV could also be enacted if required. Ultimately Jackson gave in-principle support to the plan but would not release the relief force until he thought it warranted.|$|E

Alex Henderson from AllMusic gave the album {{four and a}} half stars out of five, saying that the album was [...] "arguably the finest and most essential album that she recorded in the 1990s" [...] and also stated that besides its lyrics, the album would impress even non-Spanish-speaking listeners with its [...] "attractive melodies and the emotion that the artist brings to her songs". He finished his review saying, [...] "if you're acquiring your first Shakira release, this would be the ideal choice".

Mark Kemp, writing for the book The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, said that the album mined a familiar territory in Shakira's music, but it [...] "holds together with stronger songs, a beefier sound, and more confident vocals". He finished his review by saying that it was [...] "hard to imagine a singer barely into her 20s having written and recorded such an inventive set of songs", while complimenting Estefan's production, calling it [...] "surprisingly tasteful and evenhanded".|$|E

Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents {{a time when the}} show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning.

[...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out."
