5|$|Completing stages rewards {{the player}} with medals {{that can be}} spent on {{challenge}} stages, music, and costumes for Qbby. Additional medals can be earned by collecting crowns found on each stage, which must be collected before {{a certain number of}} <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> used. The game makes use of the Nintendo 3DS' Play Coin feature; Play Coins can be used to request hints to the puzzle solutions. BoxBoy! features a black and white monochrome graphical style. The game features a minimal story, in which Qbby meets two additional characters, Qucy and Qudy, after progressing through certain worlds.|$|E
5|$|From 1933, {{the threat}} of Japanese {{invasion}} forced the evacuation {{of the most important}} parts of the Museum's collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Communists' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artefacts, 2,972 <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> {{found to}} have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is {{examined}} and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul {{from one of his}} old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> his. Walter tries to remember what he put in the boxes and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men.|$|E

5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic {{structure and}} {{a high degree of}} sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. <b>Boxes</b> <b>are</b> created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E

25|$|At each station, <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> {{handed over}} to a local dabbawala, who {{delivers}} them. The empty <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> collected after lunch {{or the next day}} and sent back to the respective houses. The dabbawalas also allow for delivery requests through SMS.|$|E
25|$|The last task of {{the agent}} is to ensure that, on the close of voting, the ballot <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> still secure and the seals are intact. This may be done at a {{designated}} counting centre instead of the voting centre. The <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> opened once the agents are certain {{that there is no}} tampering.|$|E

50|$|The No 1 Jcn <b>box</b> <b>was</b> {{closed in}} 1887 {{and after that}} the former S&DJR main line between it and No 3 Jcn became a dead-end, {{accessed}} only from No 3 Jcn and serving the S&DJR loco shed and lower yard. In 1933, the B <b>box</b> <b>was</b> closed and the frame in the A <b>box</b> <b>was</b> altered (and possibly extended) to control the S&DJR movements. In the same year the No 3 Jcn <b>box</b> <b>was</b> closed and its functions transferred to the No 2 Jcn box, in which the lever-frame was extended.|$|R

25|$|Each {{candidate}} is allowed one agent per voting centre. Their job starts early and begins by inspecting that the metal ballot boxes {{have not been}} tampered.

50|$|The {{station was}} built {{next to the}} level {{crossing}} of the Ottery Road which was operated by the station staff. A signal <b>box</b> <b>was</b> provided in 1875 at {{the east end of}} the station {{on the north side of}} the line, opposite goods yard. Because it was too far from the level crossing a small signal <b>box</b> <b>was</b> provided at that end of the station to control the level crossing. The main signal <b>box</b> <b>was</b> closed on 21 May 1967 but the level crossing <b>box</b> <b>was</b> retained. The line through the station reduced to just a single track on 11 June 1967. In 1974 the level crossing gates were replaced by lifting barriers; the level crossing <b>box</b> <b>was</b> abolished at the same time and the barriers are operated from a panel within the station building.|$|R
