The cover's caption–"Eva Perón: <b>Between</b> <b>two</b> <b>worlds,</b> an Argentine rainbow"–was {{a reference to the}} name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E

25|$|Changing Times (Les temps qui changent) (2004) is a warmhearted {{exploration}} of cultural collision in contemporary Morocco, oscillating <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>worlds</b> and two {{ideas about the}} meaning of experience and the enduring power of love.

They eventually cross paths in a supermarket. Téchiné weaves together a half dozen subplots, creating a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness.|$|E

The song Hent-eon (foam path) describes the wish of a man from Lesconil {{to be buried in}} such a path so that he will be watched over by nature. This idea of a link <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>worlds,</b> between life and death, also appears in Daouzek huñvre, where seven lost spirits clothed in flesh walk in line on a foam path.|$|E

500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. J. Hoberman, author of Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film <b>Between</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Worlds,</b> writes that the Lower East Side had reached a total population of 540,000 and the world [...] "ghetto" [...] became a buzzword. Other 1910 films on the subject included Yankee's The Ghetto Seamstress and D. W. Griffith's A Child of the Ghetto. Patricia Erens, author of The Jew in American Cinema says these films highlight the hard-working Jewess in melodramatic situations that are only resolved with improbable solutions. The setting for the film included scenes in Manhattan's Chinatown and was advertised as [...] "a study of settlement conditions in the great East Side of New York City. It was produced right {{in the heart of}} the ghetto to assure a faithful presentation of East Side localities and life. Representatives of all races and nationalities pass through the picture, from the slow-stepping Russian to the gliding Chinee." [...] Some of the details of the production were recorded due to the flaws in the depicting a sweatshop and the fact the Hebrew characters are not recognizable as Hebrews.|$|E
