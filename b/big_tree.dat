5|$|Continuing {{northwest}} through Wales, NY78 {{remains a}} two-lane rural street known as Strykersville Road until intersecting with US20A (<b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road) at a T-intersection. US 20A and NY 78 become concurrent along <b>Big</b> <b>Tree,</b> proceeding west {{through the town}} of Wales. The routes remain a two-lane residential street for a distance, intersecting with CR383 (Reiter Road) as it winds west. Now {{in the town of}} Aurora, US 20A and NY 78 enter a large interchange with NY400 (the Aurora Expressway). A short distance later, the routes enter the village of East Aurora. Now known as Main Street, US 20A and NY 78 proceed west as a two-lane village street, intersecting with NY16 (Olean Road) and the southern continuation of CR6 (Pine Street).|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{state highway}} renumbering, NY5 was {{truncated}} even further {{to begin in}} downtown Buffalo. The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY62. Southwest of Buffalo, Southwestern Boulevard, an alternate route of US20 between Irving and <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> (east of Athol Springs) became NY20B. Further southwest, another alternate route of US20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek, running along the shore of Lake Erie, was designated as NY20A. The NY20A and NY20B designations proved to be short-lived. US62 was extended into New York , causing NY62 to be renumbered. Around the same time, US20 was realigned to follow NY20B from Irving to <b>Big</b> <b>Tree.</b> NY5 was extended along part of old NY62 to Athol Springs, from where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US20's old routing to Irving and all of NY20A.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} listed residences in Dunham Massey, most {{dating from the}} 18th or early-19th century, and many feature Flemish bond {{brickwork}} and slate roofs. They include: Dunham Massey Lodge, on Dunham Road; Willow Cottage; numbers 1 and 2 Barns Lane; number 1 Orchard View; The Hollies, on Station Road; numbers 1, 3 and 4 Woodhouse Lane; <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Cottages, on Woodhouse Lane. Agden View, also on Woodhouse Lane, dates from 1725 and has both garden wall bond and Flemish bond brickwork. <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> House, on Charcoal Road, dates from the mid-18th century and features English bond brickwork. Yew Tree Cottage and Lime Tree Cottage are also on Charcoal Lane; both houses date to the 17th century and exhibit garden wall bond brickwork with slate roofs.

5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Just outside Athol Springs, NY75 passes {{under two}} {{railroad}} bridges, carrying the Norfolk Southern Railway-owned Lake Erie District {{line and the}} CSX Transportation-owned Lake Shore Subdivision line over the highway. On {{the other side of}} the overpasses, NY75 curves northeastward as it becomes Saint Francis Drive, leaving Camp Road to continue northwestward to the lake as a two-lane street. The route continues on, passing south of Saint Francis High School before ending shortly afterward at a partial interchange with NY5. NY75 northbound merges directly into NY5 eastbound, a limited-access highway, while NY75 southbound begins as an offshoot of NY5 westbound. The remaining connections are made by way of a loop road leading from <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road, which NY5 and NY75 both intersect just south of the interchange.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
25|$|As <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road once more, US20A acts as {{the major}} eastwest {{thoroughfare}} for Lakeville, connecting the hamlet to I-390 {{in the west to}} the village of Livonia to the east. In the center of Lakeville, US20A intersects the north–south NY15. The two routes converge on <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road, following the roadway around the northern tip of Conesus Lake and southeastward through the rural landscape between Lakeville and Livonia. In Livonia, <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road continues to the southeast as <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Street; however, US20A and NY15 leave <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road to follow Main Street instead. NY15 remains on US20A for one more block to the center of Livonia, at which point it continues southward on Commercial Street toward Conesus while US20A heads east on Main Street and out of the village as Richmond Mills Road.|$|E

40|$|Aims Many {{mechanisms}} of forest patterns {{have been examined}} in tropical rain forest; however, {{there are only a}} handful of similar studies on subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest. Our objective is to analyze the main {{mechanisms of}} distribution pattern of Castanopsis eyrei and Schima superba in GTS (Gutianshan) forest plot. Methods Based on a stem map of a 24 hm 2 permanent plot in the middle subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest at Gutianshan National Reserve, we analyzed the distribution pattern of the dominant species C. eyrei and S. superba in saplings, juvenile trees, adult trees, large trees and old trees using spatial point pattern analysis. We also examined spatial associations among different growth stages. Important findings Castanopsis eyrei and S. superba had a clustered distribution across a range of scales (0 – 100 m). Saplings, juvenile trees and adult trees tended to be more clumped than <b>big</b> <b>trees.</b> Old trees tended to be somewhat more clumped than <b>big</b> <b>trees.</b> Our results suggested that the two species have obvious habitat preferences at larger scales. For C. eyrei, saplings were significantly positively associated with juvenile trees at scales ≤ 100 m, as were saplings and adult trees, juvenile trees and adult trees, adult <b>trees</b> and <b>big</b> <b>trees.</b> Generally there was no correlation between <b>big</b> <b>trees</b> and old trees at scales ≤ 10 m, whereas their association tended to be positive at larger scales (10 – 100 m). Generally there were negative or no correlations between other size classes. For S. superba, the saplings were significantly positively associated with juvenile trees at scales ≤ 100 m, as were saplings and adult trees, juvenile trees and adult trees. Generally there were negative or no correlations between juvenile trees and old trees, adult trees and old <b>trees,</b> <b>big</b> <b>trees</b> and old <b>trees,</b> saplings and <b>big</b> <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> and <b>big</b> <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> and <b>big</b> <b>trees.</b> Generally there was negative correlation between saplings and old trees at scales ≤ 20 m, whereas their association tended to be positively at larger scales (25 – 100 m). These results suggested that dominant species facilitated coexistence of other species through emptying space for colonization of other species, which is probably attributed to density dependence or the Janzen-Connell effect. Both processes depended on species in intensity and acting time...|$|R

25|$|NY35 {{was largely}} {{replaced}} by US20 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York in 1927. At the time, US20 entered the Buffalo area on modern NY5 and followed <b>Big</b> <b>Tree</b> Road and current US20A east to East Aurora, where it overlapped NY16 {{to reach the}} former routing of NY35. From there, it continued east over former NY35 to Geneseo before proceeding to Avon on modern NY39. Meanwhile, NY4 was renumbered to NY2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4 in the Capital District. The portion of former NY35 between Geneseo and Lakeville went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became the westernmost portion of NY254, an east–west highway that initially extended eastward along modern US20A and CR32 to a junction with NY21 west of Canandaigua. NY254 was truncated westward to NY64 in Bristol by the following year.|$|E
25|$|After Peta Nocona's death (c. 1864), being now Parra-o-coom ("Bull Bear") {{the head}} {{chief of the}} Quahadi band and Kobay-o-burra ("Wild Horse") the second ranking, Quanah was {{introduced}} into the Nokoni band, where the head chief Tirhayaquahip also called Kiyou ("Horseback") took him under his wing. After Peta Nocona and Pohebits-quasho, Tirhayaquahip taught Quanah {{the ways of the}} Comanche Warrior and he grew to considerable standing as a warrior. He left and joined again the Quahadi (Antelope Eaters) band with warriors from another band. Quanah Parker surrendered to Mackenzie and was taken to Fort Sill, Indian Territory where he led the Comanches successfully {{for a number of years}} on the reservation. Quanah was never elected principal chief of the Comanche by the tribe. The U.S. government appointed him principal chief of the entire nation once the people had gathered on the reservation and later introduced general elections. In October 1867, when Quanah was only a young man, he had come along with the Comanche chiefs as an observer at treaty negotiations at Medicine Lodge, Kansas. Tirhayaquahip made a statement about Quanah's refusal to sign the treaty. In the early 1870s, the Plains Indians were losing the battle for their land with the United States government. Following the capture of the Kiowa chiefs Sitting Bear, <b>Big</b> <b>Tree,</b> and Satanta, the last two paroled in 1873 after two years thanks to the firm and stubborn behaviour of Guipago, the Kiowa, Comanche, and Southern Cheyenne tribes joined forces in several battles.
