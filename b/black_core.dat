There she stands, her body a little bent, her arms outstretched, her head held forward with the lips parted, just as though she were about to embrace somebody, and in one of her hands, cut also from the white sap of the umzimbiti, she grasps a human heart--Saduko's, I presume, or perhaps Umbelazi's.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to 1565 (some {{sources say}} {{as early as}} 1500), a large deposit of {{graphite}} was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England.

40|$|Elemental (carbon, sulphur and {{biogenic}} opal) {{analysis was}} performed on the bulk sediments recovered from four core sites (MAR 00 - 5, MAR 00 - 6, and MAR 00 - 8) in the <b>Black</b> Sea and <b>core</b> site MAR 98 - 11 in the Marmara Sea. Isotopic (δ¹³C and δ ³⁴S) analysis was also performed on the bulk organic matter in the sediments. Linear extrapolations based on ¹⁴C dates in the three <b>Black</b> Sea <b>cores</b> indicate that while MAR 00 - 6 is characterized by continuous and uniform sediment deposition, cores MAR 00 - 5 and MAR 00 - 8 lack a record of the last ∼ 5000 years. δ¹³C values from ∼- 26 ‰ to ∼- 23 ‰ for the TOC in the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>cores</b> indicate the mixing of isotopically light land-derived material with isotopically heavier autochthonous carbon derived from primary marine production. Interpretations from proxy data extracted from the cores suggest that relatively higher TOC contents in core MAR 00 - 6 compared to the other <b>Black</b> Sea <b>cores</b> can be explained by better preservation of organic matter. This is attributed to the existence of a more stable stratified water-column well below wave base and/or greater salinity contrast between surface and bottom waters at this site before 5000 yr BP. [...] Lithostratigraphic correlation to nearby core MAR 98 - 12 with its ¹⁴C dates places sapropel deposition in core MAR 98 - 11 between ∼ 9800 to ∼ 6600 yr BP, which coincides with the contemporaneous sapropel S 1 in the Aegean Sea. δ¹³C values, the relatively high terrestrial organic-carbon component and other proxy data during this period point to a predominantly terrestrial source for the organic matter and reduced oxygen levels in the bottom waters.

5000|$|During the Spanish Civil War, {{where the}} Luftwaffe participated through the Condor Legion, {{aircraft}} were repainted {{with a white}} Andrea's Cross in a black circle. The tail was all white with Andrea's Cross on the rudder. In Germany itself, the Balkenkreuz was once again used as the national insignia on the fuselage and wings in six locations, initially with a very narrow set of four white [...] "flanks", which were widened around 1938-39, with the usual Hakenkreuz on the vertical tail surfaces, usually on the fixed fin, but sometimes instead on the rudder (as done on some Arado-designed aircraft) and on airframe designs that either had a small fin or one braced with struts. Medical aircraft were painted with a red cross on a white circular background. Later on in the war when camouflage was more necessary, the Balkenkreuz had only a white or black outline in a [...] "low-visibility" [...] format, consisting only of the four right-angle [...] "flanks" [...] that had previously bordered the now-absent central <b>black</b> <b>core</b> cross of the Balkenkreuz, with the Hakenkreuz also frequently being done with a white or black border only, omitting the central black shape.|$|E

From 1933 to 1935, civilian aircraft were painted with a bright red horizontal band with a black Hakenkreuz (swastika) in a white circle superimposed, shown only on the vertical stabilizer. From 1936, the Balkenkreuz (national cross with four equal arms), basically inherited from the early spring 1918 period of Luftstreitkräfte service when it first appeared in World War I, was applied in black and white, with somewhat different proportions (one-quarter as wide as its length from end-to-end) than the WW I-period insignia, and without the white border outlining the [...] "ends" [...] of the cross, the white borders forming four right-angled [...] "flanks" [...] around the central <b>black</b> <b>core</b> cross. It was painted on the fuselage about halfway between the wing and the tail and on the upper and lower sides of each wing. The flanks came in two regulation dimension formats, with much narrower flanks before July 1939 used in all six positions on an airframe — a wider-flanked variation, for use underneath wings and on the fuselage sides, came into use from July 1939 onwards. This helped in immediate identification.|$|E

Thus his goal is to blast away the surface using a {{hexagonal}} <b>Black</b> <b>Core</b> explosion field to both rid the world of weak humans while also giving the sun to the mazoku. Near the end of the manga, it was revealed that in order to achieve immortality, Vearn separated his body into two parts. The body he directly controls retains the intelligence and magic power, while the body that was given to Myst retained his physical strength. The second body became Myst-Vearn. Vearn used his great magic power to use the spell of Frozen Time on Myst-Vearn. As Myst is a unique case of being able to manipulate a body that is affected by that spell, Myst-Vearn's body effectively acquired immortality, while Vearn's body, while growing in intelligence and magic power, kept aging. After being defeated by Dai, Vearn decided to restore his original body and became more powerful than ever. He was defeated again with great difficulty by Dai and turned into stone. Vearn has the ability to cast almost every type of magic available, including one of his strongest types: Mera type magic (his Mera is stronger than Pop's Merazoma). Because Vearn can also cast healing spells, he is considered a Wiseman class, one of the highest class of magicians. Vearn also had a staff given to him by Lon Berk, which can turn magic power into physical attack power, though it eats power at an immense rate. Vearn's most powerful attacks are a phoenix-shaped Merazoma, Kaiser Phoenix, and Calamity Wall, a wall of rushing energy created by his legendary staff weapon.|$|E

40|$|A new {{finding of}} the {{observation}} of an elemental gradient or zoning of calcium and sulphur in fired brick bodies is described, that {{does not appear to}} have been reported in the literature before. Many raw clays used in brickmaking and pottery contain sulphur and calcium evenly distributed in low amounts in the unfired clay body. However, when the clay body is fired in the kiln at 1050 °C, the elements sulphur and calcium appear to combine to a compound, most probably calcium sulphate. The formation of calcium sulphate, visualised using energy dispersive imaging micro X-ray fluorescence (?-XRF), only occurs around a so-called reduction core, also known as ‘black core’, caused by reduced magnetite Fe 3 O 4 in the centre of the brick body. The presence of a <b>black</b> reduction <b>core</b> appears to cause the formation of a calcium sulphate layer around the <b>black</b> reduction <b>core.</b> This research contributes to the understanding of phenomena like salt formation, efflorescence and durability in solid clay brick bodies. Large sums are spent on building conservation by national economies and improvement of bricks is of key interest to them. <br/...|$|R

However, Kamen Rider Core proves too powerful and the two go underground to destroy the Gaia Memory's source of power to even the odds. Kamen Rider Double CycloneJokerXtreme and Kamen Rider OOO Latorartar Combo manage to outrun Kamen Rider Core and discover a giant crystal near the Earth's core - the source of Kamen Rider Core's power. Back on the surface, Ryu persuades Akiko to allow him to become Kamen Rider Accel to protect her from the Pteranodon Yummy before Shintaro Goto arrives as Kamen Rider Birth and backs up Accel in destroying the Yummy. Back underground, after Ankh shows up, which disturbs Shotaro, the Kamen Riders manage to destroy the crystal which only angers Kamen Rider Core. The two Kamen Riders call him a mockery of what a Kamen Rider truly is. Ankh gives Kamen Rider OOO the Medals required to transform into Tajadol Combo, and the resulting wind from the transformation allows Kamen Rider W to transform into CycloneJokerGoldXtreme. The two Kamen Riders execute a combination Prominence Drop and Golden Xtreme Double Rider Kick that destroys Kamen Rider Core and shatters his core components. With a renewed sense of faith in the Kamen Riders, Akiko and the others hurry to her wedding while Eiji finds himself in Rio de Janeiro where Chiyoko Shiraishi just happens to be on vacation. At the wedding, Akiko discovers that Melissa is attending, and learns that Sokichi asked her to take his place at the wedding as he knew he can never see his own daughter again, while pulling his sleeve up revealing that the Spider Bomb didn't die with the Dopant. With that knowledge in mind, and her father with her in spirit, Akiko's marriage to Ryu goes without any hitch.

5000|$|Baran (Baran) [...] - The {{commander}} of the Super Dragon Brigade, Baran is a fierce fighter with strong morals. He is the true Dragon Knight of the era and in his youth he defeated Velther. After the fight he was mortally wounded and would have died {{if not for the}} help of Soara, the princess of Alkeed who nursed him back to health. The two fell in love, but when her father the king discovered that Baran was not human he was thrown out of the castle (after being accused of being a follower of a demon) only to be followed by Soara, who announced to him that she was pregnant. Some months later, Baran and Soara lived happy and without concerns, taking care of baby Dai (whom they named Dino.) When the king found the two, Baran voluntarily gave himself up to protect his wife and child. He was brought back to Alkeed and sentenced to death. When Baran was to be executed with fire spells, Soara jumped in the way to protect him and was fatally wounded. Soara's father claimed her to be a disgrace, and in a rage Baran destroyed the entire kingdom of Alkeed. He then desperately tried to search for his son but was unable to find Dai. Having lost his wife and his child by the hands of humans, whom he was tasked to protect, he decided that all humans should be exterminated. He was later reunited with Dai as enemies. Upon seeing Dai's dragon knight symbol, he realized that he is his son and wipes Dai's memories. He tried to persuade Dai to join him but Dai refused to believe he is Baran's son. Pop sacrifices himself to return Dai's memories during the second time they fight, but fails to scratch Baran with Megante. Later, Baran joins with Dai to fight against Vearn but is killed when he shields Dai from the explosion of a <b>Black</b> <b>Core</b> Crystal when fighting Hadlar. Baran has a high mastery of his crest and can transform into a Ryuumajin, the ultimate form of a Dragon Knight, which is a combination of a demon, human, and dragon. In this form, he is unable to discern between friend and foe until everything is dead. He also has Giga Break (a powerful move utilizing the ultimate electricity spell, Gigadein, and his legendary sword, the Demon Dragon Blade), Raidein type magic, and Draconic Aura. Baran's ultimate spell is Draura (Dragon Touki Cannon). This spell channels Draconic Aura into a cannon blast that can annihilate a whole country, and can only be used in his Ryuumajin form.|$|E
