5|$|As Liz Lemon is {{returning}} to studio 6H, the TGS with Tracy Jordan studio, she meets Jack Donaghy returning from Washington. Jack tells her {{that he intends to}} get his old job back and Liz tells him of her upcoming adoption evaluation. When he confronts Devon Banks in his office, Devon offers Jack a position in the mail room, laughing, but Jack accepts. Jack later tells Liz of his plan to work his way back to his old job through honest means, though Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) shows a sexual interest in Jack he could leverage into a quicker promotion. When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her <b>business</b> <b>adviser.</b> Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he can sue the drivers.|$|E
5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business. Martinez became a <b>business</b> <b>adviser</b> to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{consider}} the methods used by publicly supported <b>business</b> <b>advisers</b> to assess their client <b>businesses.</b> These <b>business</b> <b>advisers</b> are increasingly required to diagnose the problem or opportunities that face their clients before recommending types of business support. Design/methodology/approach: The study reports semi‐structured interviews with 39 <b>business</b> <b>advisers,</b> from accountants to publicly funded <b>Business</b> Link <b>business</b> <b>advisers.</b> Findings: The study suggests {{that one of the}} key to understanding the way in which <b>advisers</b> assess <b>businesses</b> is through congruence, that is does the business reflect the aims and objectives of the management in its operations and processes. Failure to be congruent can deliver error messages to advisers that suggest a problem diagnosis. Practical implications: Business advice is shown to be a process that involves judgemental decision making. In turn, this may enable advisers to focus on solutions to these identified problems. Originality/value: This paper builds on a significant gap in the extant knowledge on the processes of making diagnosis of business problems in a holistic manner...|$|R

In 1983, Landy was re-employed as Wilson's therapist, subsequently becoming his executive producer, business manager, co-songwriter, and <b>business</b> <b>adviser.</b> Landy went on to co-produce Wilson's debut solo album and allegedly ghostwrote portions of Wilson's disowned memoir [...] In 1989, Landy agreed to let the state of California revoke his professional license amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct.

On the basis of small firms in Norway the aim {{of this article is to}} contribute to our understanding of the determinants of such variations.

[...] "Bob West was a prosperous man and very careful about his own investments; so he became a sort of <b>business</b> <b>adviser</b> to my father and Mr. Thompson, and arbitrated any {{differences}} of opinion they might have. For several years, due to West's good offices, the two oddly mated friends were successful in their ventures, and added to their capital. Finally West came to them himself with a proposition. He had discovered {{a chance to make}} a good deal of money by purchasing an extensive pine forest near Almaquo, just across the border in Canada. West had taken an option on the property, when he found by accident that the Pierce-Lane Lumber Company was anxious to get hold of the tract and cut the timber on a royalty that would enable the owners to double their investment." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{having no}} <b>business</b> <b>adviser,</b> I was doing honorable {{things in a}} foolish way. With no {{knowledge}} of how to publish my work I was bringing out a problem novel here, a realistic novelette there and a book of short stories in a third place, all to the effect of confusing my public and disgusting the book-seller. But then, no one in those days had any very clear notion of how to launch a young writer, and so (as I had entered the literary field by way of a side-gate) I was doing as well as could have been expected of me. My idea, it appears, was to get as many books into the same market {{at the same time as}} possible. As a matter of fact none of them paid me any royalty, my subsistence came from the sale of such short stories as I was able to lodge with The Century, and Harper's, The Youth's Companion and The Arena.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{the relatively high}} failure rate of small firms.

The paper then analyses variations in the use small firms in Norway make of authorized accountants as <b>business</b> <b>advisers.</b> The analysis reveals that the quality, rather than the longevity, of the relationship is an important precondition for accountants being used as <b>business</b> <b>advisers.</b> However, the study also indicates that the firm has to have a competency orientation...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{have been}} made to systems of {{publicly}} funded business advice to implement a 'strategic sounding board' role for <b>business</b> <b>advisers.</b> Previous literature has shown how this role could be modelled in a 'coupole'. The 'coupole' administers a programme but does not deliver it. The shifting of policy towards this strategic sounding role takes place within the context of existing organisations, however. We review three streams of the literature on business advice: small firm policy, critical management consulting, and organisational development consulting. We introduce a triad of producer, process, and client to understand the implications of changes to the <b>business</b> <b>adviser's</b> role. The paper examines two case studies where public policy has changed to shift <b>business</b> <b>advisers</b> into this sounding board role: England and Scotland. The research suggests: (1) that the new role increases the skills demanded of public sector business advisers; (2) that changes to one part of the triad impacts on all the others; (3) the existing organisation contributes {{to the way in which}} the producers react to change in the other parts of the triad. The responses in the networked English support organisations have been innovative but fragmented with little evaluation. In the more hierarchical Scottish organisations, the response has been more measured, both in the sense of being cautious and in the sense of being evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The aim is {{to examine}} the {{perceptions}} of small business entrepreneurs regarding the efficacy of external <b>business</b> <b>advisers</b> in delivering sustainable strategic and operational guidance. Design/methodology/approach The research is interpretivist, exploring the narratives of SME owner/managers in manufacturing. Five in depth interviews were carried out, revealing a range of decision stories about the use of external <b>business</b> <b>advisers.</b> Research limitations/implications A small scale study, it would be worthwhile to examine the perceptions of additional entrepreneurs to <b>business</b> <b>advisers,</b> in order to compare research findings. Findings Whilst there was some scepticism towards the use of advisers in certain situations, the research revealed that levels of trust, relationship building and the credibility of the consultant are substantial factors in determining whether the engagement is successful or not. Practical implications Policy regarding advice to small businesses should be framed in terms of the local context of the firm and its owner, rather than on broad and generalisable systems of business knowledge. Time and effort is required in order to build a sustainable relationship between advisers and owners and it is recommended particular attention is paid to the process. Social implications The research suggests that potentially, industrial policy regarding current delivery of small business advice requires readjustments towards more of a relationship focus. Originality/value Little established research appears to exist in relation to the tendency or otherwise, for SME decision makers to pursue and utilise external advice. This paper helps to fill an important gap in the literature whilst offering some significant and nuanced insights into the perceptions of SME owner managers...|$|R
