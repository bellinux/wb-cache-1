5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E

5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears.

Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E
5|$|While {{many of the}} failings in Australian command {{arrangements}} {{evident from}} {{the initial stages of}} the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard operating procedures, future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without them. Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry.|$|E

5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser‚Äîa central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{part of the}} {{strategy}} {{of the game is}} to begin by selecting a relatively powerful button. However, buttons may be stronger or weaker when playing against other buttons with certain characteristics. For example, a button with small Poison dice might <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> in general because it has fewer dice worth positive points for its opponent to capture. However, a button with large Shadow dice might <b>be</b> <b>powerful</b> against that button specifically because it can allow the round to end with the Poison and Shadow dice unable to capture each other, and therefore still counted towards their owners' scores.|$|E
