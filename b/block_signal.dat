5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's <b>block</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E
25|$|SUGEN, {{a company}} focused on protein kinase inhibitors, {{was founded in}} 1991 in Redwood City, California, and {{acquired}} by Pharmacia in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> transduction. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, {{with the loss of}} over 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included sunitinib (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1billion in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010. A related compound, SU11654 (Toceranib), was also approved for canine tumors, and the ALK inhibitor Crizotinib also grew out of a SUGEN program.|$|E

25|$|The TTC is {{converting}} its <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> {{system to}} {{automatic train control}} on Line 1 Yonge–University {{at a cost of}} $562.3 million. With ATC, the TTC will be able to reduce the headway between trains on Line 1 from 2.5 minutes to 1 minute and 55 seconds during rush hours, and allow a 25 per cent {{increase in the number of}} trains operating on Line 1. ATC will be introduced to Line 1 in phases. The first phase is to activate ATC between Spadina and Wilson stations by fall 2017. With the opening of the Toronto–York Spadina Subway Extension in December 2017, ATC will be extended north from Wilson Station to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre. The entire line would be converted to ATC in 2019. By November 6, 2017, the TTC had successfully tested ATC in regular service over a 13-day period between Dupont and Yorkdale stations.|$|E
25|$|The CBTC {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 1994 {{and approved by}} the MTA in 1997. Installation of the signal system was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous automatic <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system. The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. In the 2015–2019 Capital Program, funding was provided for three more electrical substations for the line so that it could accommodate even more trains per hour. Also included in the Capital Program is the installation of automatic signals on the line to facilitate the movement of work trains between interlockings.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E
25|$|The system {{currently}} uses <b>block</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{which is}} used in other systems such as the Toronto subway and RT. The <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> that the New York City Subway currently uses is identical to those on the RT's signaling system.|$|R

25|$|As {{with many}} other rail lines, the signal system on the Market–Frankford Line has progressed from the {{original}} lineside <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> using semaphores, to three-aspect Type D color light (green, over yellow, over red) signals, to cab signalling, eliminating the lineside <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> except at interlockings.|$|R
500|$|The Walt Disney World Railroad {{utilizes}} block {{signals to}} notify the engineers, firemen, and conductors on each train whether the track segments along the railroad's [...] of main-line track are clear or occupied by other trains. The WDWRR's track is divided into seven such segments, or blocks, and each block has a track-side <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> to communicate its status. Block signals are located {{at each of the}} three stations, alongside the three main-line blocks between the stations, and alongside the spur line connecting the WDWRR's roundhouse to the main line.|$|E
500|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to Disneyland's entrance, where a pump-style handcar {{built by the}} Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company {{can be seen on}} a siding, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. The train will take around 18 minutes to complete a round trip on the main line when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running; on any given day, between two and four trains run, with three trains running on average. An engineer accompanied by a fireman operates the locomotive, while conductors {{at each end of the}} train supervise the passengers. Prior to departing Main Street, U.S.A. Station, the engineer must confirm whether the signal light in the locomotive's cab is green, indicating that the track segment ahead is clear, or red, indicating that the track segment ahead is occupied by another train. The DRR's route is divided into eleven such segments, or blocks, and each locomotive has a <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> in its cab to communicate the status of each block. Prior to the installation of cab signalling in the locomotives around 2005, the status of each block along the railroad's [...] of main-line track was displayed by track-side block signals, of which only the ones at the four stations remain.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, Mrozowski’s {{study of}} rear yards {{associated}} with the Boott Mill boardinghouses and tenements that housed workers revealed that these yards mainly served practical functions and were not primarily used to grow foodstuffs, and may not have served an integral part in {{the daily lives of}} the low-wage workers hired (99-100). Mrozowski also argues that yards also represented social distance and distinctiveness between socio-economic classes of people, due to the particular placement, use, and overall function.

During the 1950s and 1960s the Montauk Branch between Jamaica and Babylon continued going through a massive grade crossing elimination project, with the line being elevated from street level {{over a number of}} years. Mandated by federal and state agencies after the 1950 Kew Gardens (Richmond Hill) train collision, the railroad began to install an Automatic Speed Control system to supplement (and later replace) the wayside automatic <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system on a majority of its lines. Finally, the LIRR was able to completely replace its steam locomotives with diesels, with the last steam-hauled trains running on October 8, 1955.
