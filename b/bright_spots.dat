40|$|Data are {{presented}} which show {{the power of}} a long-slit IR spectrograph to yield spectral and spatial coverage of the Jovian auroral zones in an efficient manner. Strong 3 micron H 3 (+) lines are observed on the eastern <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> and moderately strong 3 micron H 3 (+) lines in the central meridian and western region of the northern aurora. Higher temperatures are found in the central meridian and western region of the northern aurora compared with a temperature of 1000 K +/- K on the eastern <b>bright</b> <b>spot,</b> suggesting an enhanced abundance of H 3 (+) on the <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> compared to other auroral regions. The H 2 quadrupole lines of Q 1 (1), Q 1 (3), S 1 (1), and several H 3 (+) lines between 2 and 2. 5 microns are identified in the northern auroral region. The eastern <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> as seen in the 2 micron H 2 and H 3 (+) emission lines is at nearly the same position as the eastern <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> due to the 3 micron H 3 (+) fundamental band lines...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the location of the pituitary <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> in patients with pituitary macroadenomas before surgery. METHODS: A total of 54 patients with pituitary macroadenomas were retrospectively in-cluded in this study. Nonenhanced spin-echo T 1 -weighted MR images were reviewed to identify the location of the high-intensity-signal posterior pituitary lobe that indicates antidiuretic hormone (ADH) storage. Images were acquired with a 1. 5 -T machine by using 3 -mm-thick contiguous sections in two or three orthogonal planes and a 300 512 matrix. RESULTS: The <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> corresponding to ADH storage was identified in 44 (81 %) patients. Two groups of patients were defined by the height of the macroadenoma: Group A patients (n 27) had pituitary macroadenomas less than 20 mm in height, and group B (n 27) had macroadenomas 20 mm or larger. In group A, the <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> was identified in 25 patients (93 %); it was located in the sella in 24 of these cases (96 %). In group B, the <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> was identified in 19 patients (70 %); it was in an ectopic location in 14 of these cases (74 %). CONCLUSION: MR imaging can be used to depict the pituitary <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> in most patients with pituitary macroadenomas before surgery. The <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> is usually identified at it...|$|R

5|$|Zethus Crater is {{the largest}} (diameter about 40km) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter's moon Thebe. There are several <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> at the rim of this crater. It {{is located on the}} far side of Thebe, facing away from Jupiter. It was {{discovered}} by the Galileo spacecraft. It is named for Zethus, the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was left}} with a weak side of young and inexperienced players which would stumble to a franchise-worst record of only 3 wins against 10 losses during the 2008 Super 14 season, and {{finished}} as the lowest-placed New Zealand team on the table. Jimmy Cowan, one of the team's few <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> through this period, was appointed team captain for 2009, but things would improve little over the following two seasons as the team again limped to the worst record of the New Zealand clubs. When Moore was released as coach following the 2010 season, the franchise had compiled a record of only 10 wins against 29 losses in three seasons under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, Michigan lost 75–52 in its rivalry {{game against}} (#8 AP/#8 Coaches) Michigan State. Among those in {{attendance}} were Rick Snyder, Matthew Stafford, Mark Dantonio, Brady Hoke, and Lloyd Carr. It {{marked the first}} time both teams were ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll, and resulted in Michigan losing back-to-back games and three consecutive road games {{for the first time since}} the 2010–11 team did so. Burke's 18 points, 4 assists and 3 steals were one of Michigan's few <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in their February 12 contest.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in {{this stretch}} was Iginla, who {{captured}} the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies in 2001–02 as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points. Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy, tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk, with 41 goals in 2003–04. Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. Regehr had suffered two broken legs {{in a car accident}} the summer of 1999, but recovered in time to play 57 games at the age of 19.|$|E
5|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was hired}} soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired {{away from the}} UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its {{national}} prominence of Dodd's era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver, replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director, and attempted to reinvigorate Tech's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry, who had no experience as a head coach, but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry's first two Tech teams from 1980–1981 went 2-19-1 with the only <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> being a brilliant 24-21 victory over Bear Bryant's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3-3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so bad, they could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17-14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl.|$|E

25|$|The Pacers {{finished}} their inaugural NBA {{season with a}} record of 36–46. Billy Knight and Don Buse represented Indiana in the NBA All-Star Game.

25|$|The {{next major}} {{happening}} that summer was in July with {{the announcement that}} GM Ron Knol was leaving the team to pursue other interests.

25|$|Despite {{the slow}} finish, {{there were still}} a few <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in the second half.

40|$|We present near-infrared, H-band (1. 45 - 1. 85 µm) {{observations}} of the eclipsing dwarf nova, IP Peg, in quiescence. The light curves are composed of ellipsoidal variations from the late-type secondary star and emission from the accretion disk and the <b>bright</b> <b>spot.</b> The light curves have two eclipses: a primary eclipse of the accretion disk and the <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> by the companion star, and a secondary eclipse of the companion star by the disk. The ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star were modeled and subtracted from the data. The resulting light curve shows a pronounced double-hump variation. The double-hump profile resembles those seen in the light curves of WZ Sge and AL Com and likely originates in the accretion disk. The primary eclipse was modeled using maximum entropy disk mapping techniques. The accretion disk has a flat intensity distribution and a cool brightness temperature (Tbr ≃ 3000 K) in the near-infrared. Superimposed {{on the face of}} the disk is the <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> (Tbr ≃ 10, 000 K); the position of the <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> is different from the observed range of visible <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> positions. The near-infrared accretion disk flux is dominated by optically thin emission. The secondary eclipse indicates the presence of some occulting medium in the disk, but the eclipse depth is too shallow to be caused by a fully opaque accretion disk...|$|R
