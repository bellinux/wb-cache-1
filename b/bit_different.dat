Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a <b>bit</b> <b>different</b> to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

The New York Times called it a [...] "low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution" [...] and considered the songs featured in the film to be [...] "catchy". Geoff Andrew of Time Out noted that the [...] "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars. Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader on the other hand considered the wit to be [...] "too weak to sustain a film" [...] and thought that the [...] "songs all sound the same".|$|E

[...] She stated that the games have strong, epic images, and that she easily adapted her style to Wolfman's writing as he [...] "did really good work showing both dramatic and epic scenes." [...] Sorrentino used color to give importance to each scene, adding hot colors (red, orange, or brown) in action scenes and cold ones (green or light blue) in others so that readers could immediately have an emotional reaction.|$|E

50|$|To {{gain some}} of the {{advantages}} afforded by both lower and higher bit lengths, many instruction sets have <b>different</b> <b>bit</b> widths for integer and floating-point data, allowing CPUs implementing that instruction set to have <b>different</b> <b>bit</b> widths for <b>different</b> portions of the device. For example, the IBM System/360 instruction set was primarily 32 bit, but supported 64-bit floating point values to facilitate greater accuracy and range in floating point numbers. The System/360 Model 65 had an 8-bit adder for decimal and fixed-point binary arithmetic and a 60-bit adder for floating-point arithmetic. Many later CPU designs use similar mixed bit width, especially when the processor is meant for general-purpose usage where a reasonable balance of integer and floating point capability is required.|$|R
