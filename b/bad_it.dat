That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{problems in the}} 1970s, {{in the wake of}} the 1973 oil crisis marked a difficult period for Bordeaux. A series of scandals coincided with a commercial crisis in Bordeaux. The vintage of 1972 had been overpriced as was 1973 and 1974. And when the market crashed the négociants were stuck with overpriced wine that they could not sell. The early 1980s saw a new trend. Inheritance taxes were doubled in 1981 and on top of the crisis in the 1970s, many families found it increasingly difficult to hang on to their châteaux. Enter domestic and foreign insurance companies, banks and other corporate giants. Some of these companies were looking for a quick profit, others were in it as a long-term investment. But the 1980s decade wasn't all <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> also saw more great vintages in a single decade than ever before and a new era in other respects. First, wine critics (rather than just official classifications) started to have an influence on demand and prices. Wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. reviewed the 1982 Bordeaux vintage as the most sumptuous vintage in decades. Not only was this a turning point for Bordeaux wine economically, it also represented the beginning of an American domination of the reviewing of wine, especially Bordeaux. The result was a broader appeal of Bordeaux wine where the presence of fruit became a much more important factor than previously.|$|E

500|$|Decades {{after the}} film's release, {{contemporary}} reviews of The Brute Man were similarly negative, with many commentators criticizing {{the exploitation of}} Hatton's real-life acromegaly. Film reviewer Leonard Maltin gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars. John Stanley, host of the KTVU television show Creature Features, {{described it as a}} dull and [...] "shoddy thriller", criticizing both the performances and the mood from the direction and photography. The authors of Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946 were highly critical of the film's dialogue, and claimed much of the script seemed to be [...] "time-killing stuff" [...] to pad the film's already-short running time.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2009 by Magnet Films, and in the United Kingdom in August by Momentum Pictures. The American discs feature both the original Swedish dialogue and an English dubbed version, while the European versions feature only the Swedish, and an audio-descriptive track in English. Icons of Fright reported that the American release had been criticized for using new, oversimplified English subtitles instead of the original theatrical subtitles. Following customer complaints, Magnet stated that they would release an updated version with the original theatrical subtitles, but will not exchange current discs. Director Alfredson also expressed his dissatisfaction with the DVD subtitles, calling it a [...] "turkey translation". [...] "If you look on the 'net, people are furious about how <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> is done", he added. The UK release retains the theatrical subtitles.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm {{idea of what it}} is about), but doesn't make it <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ...

Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and {{that they did not}} feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how [...] "laughably <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay.

But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations".

It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for The Belize Times on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that [...] "perhaps none of [...] had ever been in a hurricane and didn't know exactly how <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> was going to be."

500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average, {{claiming}} that while it was not <b>bad,</b> <b>it</b> was not great either. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more clever than painful. Adam Buckman of the New York Post commented on the crude language used by the characters, and found there was nothing new that could have surprised him with watching the episode.

500|$|Although {{there is}} a fictional Marvel Comics {{character}} called Collector, Long did not base The Collector on him. While carrying Lawless with an electromagnet, The Collector says [...] "Care for a Rolo, sweet Xena?" [...] The reference was included because the writing staff were given free Rolos at the time. In The Collector's lair, several celebrities are seen stored in aluminized PET film bags.

[...] "There are several Doctor Who actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with" [...] Hauge explained in the episode's DVD commentary. Other captives include actress Yasmine Bleeth, Gilligan from the series Gilligan's Island and Spock and Seven of Nine from Star Trek. The segment also features the series' first reference to , when The Collector uses a mint-condition of Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber. Because the episode was written before the film's release, the writers did not know [...] "how <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> was gonna be", in their view, and therefore did not include any [...] "obligatory shot" [...] at the film.

Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or <b>bad.</b> <b>It</b> leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.'
