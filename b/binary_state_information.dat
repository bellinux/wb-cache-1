They defined VMI {{as a method of}} inspecting a Virtual Machine (VM) from the `outside' for analysing the software running on the machine. Over the past few years, VMI has seen concrete contributions, and various methods have been suggested to inspect VM data from the outside. The difficulty in interpreting the low level bits and bytes of a VM into a high level semantic state of a guest Operating System (OS) is called the [...] "semantic gap problem' [2]. To interpret the low-level <b>binary</b> <b>state</b> <b>information</b> about the VM, a virtual machine monitor (VMM) must incorporate knowledge of the hardware architecture or guest OS [3].|$|E

In the past decades, several artificial neural associativememorymodels have been developed and were expected to provide a new perspective for the modeling of the human brain, and these models were expected to {{form the basis for}} a robot to exhibit human-like behavior. However, the conventional models suffered from limited abilities. In 2006, Rigatos and Tzafestas applied the concept of Quantum Mechanics to associative memory, and introduced Quantum-Inspired Hopfield AssociativeMemory (QHAM). Although QHAM showed outstanding potential and superiority, it is limited as an auto-association model with <b>binary</b> <b>state</b> <b>information.</b> With regards to events in the real world, information representation by a binary or bipolar state is insufficient. Therefore, the ability and functional improvements of associative memory based on quantum-inspired model are defined as the main objectives in this thesis. In regards to the ability improvements in terms of memory capacity and noise tolerance, the quantum-inspired hetero-association models with batch/incremental learning algorithm are developed based on QHAM. Furthermore, the quantum-inspired complexvalued hetero-association models are considered to accommodate the high dimensional problems. Based on the results of experiments, it is shown that the quantum-inspired hetero-association models have outstanding abilities. In regards to the functional improvements, the emotion affected association model is developed in an interactive robot system based on the relationship between memory and emotion from the viewpoint of psychology and neuroscience, which is called the mood-congruency effect. The experimental results show that the emotion affected association model is able to associate the emotion dependent information to the robot similar with the mood-congruency effect...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel physical layer scheme for single user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications based on unsupervised deep learning using an autoencoder. This method extends prior {{work on the}} joint optimization of physical layer representation and encoding and decoding processes as a single end-to-end task by expanding transmitter and receivers to the multi-antenna case. We {{introduce a}} widely used domain appropriate wireless channel impairment model (Rayleigh fading channel), into the autoencoder optimization problem in order to directly learn a system which optimizes for it. We considered both spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing techniques in our implementation. Our deep learning-based approach demonstrates significant potential for learning schemes which approach and exceed {{the performance of the}} methods which are widely used in existing wireless MIMO systems. We discuss how the proposed scheme can be easily adapted for open-loop and closed-loop operation in spatial diversity and multiplexing modes and extended use with only compact <b>binary</b> channel <b>state</b> <b>information</b> (CSI) as feedback.

40|$|Abstract—In many {{applications}} retransmissions of lost packets are not permitted. OFDM is a multi-carrier modulation scheme having excellent performance which allows overlapping in frequency domain. With OFDM {{there is a}} simple {{way of dealing with}} multipath relatively simple DSP algorithms. In this paper, an image frame is compressed using DWT, and the compressed data is arranged in data vectors, each with equal number of coefficients. These vectors are quantized and binary coded to get the bit steams, which are then packetized and intelligently mapped to the OFDM system. Based on one-bit channel <b>state</b> <b>information</b> at the transmitter, the descriptions in order of descending priority are assigned to the currently good channels such that poorer sub-channels can only affect the lesser important data vectors. We consider only one-bit channel <b>state</b> <b>information</b> available at the transmitter, informing only about the sub-channels to be good or bad. For a good sub-channel, instantaneous received power should be greater than a threshold Pth. Otherwise, the sub-channel is in fading state and considered bad for that batch of coefficients. In order to reduce the system power consumption, the mapped descriptions onto the bad sub channels are dropped at the transmitter. The <b>binary</b> channel <b>state</b> <b>information</b> gives an opportunity to map the bit streams intelligently and to save a reasonable amount of power. By using MAT LAB simulation we can analysis the performance of our proposed scheme, in terms of system energy saving without compromising the received quality in terms of peak signal-noise ratio...|$|R

40|$|Markovian memory {{embedded}} in a binary system is shaping its evolution {{on the basis of}} its current state and introduces either clustering or dispersion of <b>binary</b> <b>states.</b> The consequence is directly observed in the lengthening or shortening of the runs of the same <b>binary</b> <b>state</b> and also in the way the proportion of a state within a sequence of state measurements scatters about its true average, which is quantifiable through the Markovian self-transition probabilities. It is shown that the Markovian memory can even imitate the evolution of a random process, regarding the long-term behavior of the frequencies of its <b>binary</b> <b>states.</b> This situation occurs when the associated <b>binary</b> <b>state</b> self-transition probabilities are balanced. To exemplify the behavior of Markovian memory, two natural processes are selected. The first example is studying the preferences of nonhuman troglodytes regarding handedness. The Markovian model in this case assesses the extent of influence two contiguous individuals may have on each other. The other example studies the hindering of the quantum state transitions that rapid state measurements introduce, known as the Quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Based on the current methodology, simulations of the experimentally observed clustering of states allowed for the estimation of the two self-transition probabilities in this quantum system. Through these, one can appreciate how the particular hindering of the evolution of a quantum state may have originated. The aim of this work is to illustrate as merits of the current mathematical approach, its wide range applicability and its potential to provide a variety of information regarding the dynamics of the studied process...|$|R
