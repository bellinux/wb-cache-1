5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid <b>being</b> <b>destroyed</b> by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid <b>being</b> <b>destroyed</b> by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E

Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules <b>being</b> <b>destroyed</b> in this way.|$|E

The smaller fragments were probably destroyed before they even reached the cloud layer.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without <b>being</b> <b>destroyed</b> (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog <b>being</b> <b>destroyed</b> by cutting has raised {{environmental}} concerns.
