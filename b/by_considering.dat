5|$|Every finite {{group is}} {{isomorphic}} to a matrix group, {{as one can}} see <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> the regular representation of the symmetric group. General groups can be studied using matrix groups, which are comparatively well understood, by means of representation theory.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{differential}} equations {{can be classified}} <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> the matrix of coefficients of the highest-order differential operators of the equation.

5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and {{do not apply to}} rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{suggested}} to Erwin Schrödinger {{that he might}} be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.|$|E
5|$|In 1662, {{the book}} La Logique ou l’Art de Penser was {{published}} anonymously in Paris. The authors presumably were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, two leading Jansenists, who worked together with Blaise Pascal. The Latin {{title of this}} book is Ars cogitandi, which was a successful book on logic of the time. The Ars cogitandi consists of four books, with the fourth one dealing with decision-making under uncertainty <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> the analogy to gambling and introducing explicitly {{the concept of a}} quantified probability.|$|E
5|$|Near the aircraft, a {{point cloud}} in three {{dimensions}} is acquired by changing {{the orientation of the}} laser scanning sensors fixed on pan-tilt units. After filtering data to remove floor- or insufficiently large dot clusters, a registration technique with the model of the aircraft is used to estimate the static orientation of the robot. The robot moves and holds this orientation <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> its wheel odometry, its inertial unit and visual odometry.|$|E

5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> the difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives {{of a few}} simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are important in}} singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as critical points of smooth maps from Rm to Rn. The geometry near a critical point of such a map can be described by an element of πmminus&1(S'nminus&1), <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> {{the way in which}} a small m minus& 1 sphere around the critical point maps into a topological n minus& 1 sphere around the critical value.|$|E
