The empirical research presented in this paper would explore the reasons behind such divergence. I suggest that the strength of labor militancy, the difference in the politics of economic restructuring, and the different pattern of party politics are the causes of such differences...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} cross-country variation in tax policy outcomes mainly depends on two factors: the agenda-setters’ fiscal policy preferences and {{the patterns of}} business organization. I develop a theory of tax policy change that builds on the existing literature on <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups, but incorporates the patterns of business organization as a crucial factor in explaining fiscal policy choice. This theory suggests {{that if there is}} no convergence between the policy preferences of agenda-setters and <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups, the latter will display their economic and political power in order to avoid increases in direct taxation and transfer any costs of fiscal consolidation to consumers or non-organized citizens by increasing value-added taxes or other indirect taxes. The rationale of this theory is straightforward. Both, agenda-setters and <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups, have distinctive preferences over types of taxation, tax rates, tax bases, and tax administration. Agenda-setters’ tax policy preferences are usually partisan-oriented and depend on the characteristics of the government coalition. <b>Business</b> <b>interest</b> groups usually prefer lower corporate tax rates, and their preferences about personal income and value-added taxes are ambiguous. If their preferences do not converge and both, agenda-setters and <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups, follow their most preferred policies, the feasibility of tax reforms will depend on <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups’ market leverage and their organizational capacity to coordinate firms, industry-level organizations, or economic conglomerates. Tax policy outcomes will vary as the patterns of business organization range from centralized national associations to intra-business competition. Overall, this dissertation finds support for strong and systematic links between patterns of business organization and tax politics. Additionally, I present empirical evidence that contradicts the widespread argument that agenda-setters are the predominant actors for economic policy-making in presidential regimes. These findings enrich theories of governance by modeling the role of <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups in policy-making and its implications for policy change. This dissertation not only offers a new theoretical approach but also new methodological tools to understand how <b>business</b> <b>interest</b> groups are actually influential for policy-making. Finally, this dissertation also makes an important empirical contribution for the study of business politics beyond the limited sample of developed countries...|$|R
