5|$|The orioles are {{medium-sized}} passerines, {{mostly with}} <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> showy plumage, the females often duller plumage than the males The beak is long, slightly curved and hooked.

5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E

The eldest of four children, he was described as <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> energetic in his youth. When Arthur {{was six years old}} the family moved to Riverside, Illinois, where his father {{took a job as a}} managing engineer with Commonwealth Edison Company. John Radford managed the first steam turbine engines in the United States, at the Fisk Street Generating Station.|$|E
5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Charles <b>Bright</b> <b>and</b> Latimer Clark {{proposed}} {{the names of}} ohm, volt, and farad in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre-gramme-second absolute system. This was supported by Thomson (Lord Kelvin) These names were later scaled {{for use in the}} Practical System. The concept of naming units of measure after noteworthy scientists was subsequently used for other units.|$|E

The Swedish painter, graphic artist and {{forester}} Carl Palme knew Henri Matisse {{and helped the}} artist to find a suitable location for the new Matisse Academy. An abandoned nunnery in central Paris became the first home for the academy. Together with Grünewald and Leander Engström, Jolin joined the Matisse Academy, where their friends from Stockholm had already been accepted as pupils. At the Academy, Jolin would develop his sense for a stylish line in combination with <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> clean colours in his paintings.|$|E

5|$|Oxenfree was {{developed}} primarily using the Unity game engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya. The game's artwork {{was made by}} Heather Gross. The game's camera distance from the player characters and 2D look {{were the result of}} functional necessity, as the team needed to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. Working with these requirements, Gross created parallaxing, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements of the setting were put in opposition to the supernatural elements, which are <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> geometric.|$|E
5|$|Retrospective reviews {{remembered the}} game for its <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> {{impressive}} graphics. Kameo was included in Rare Replay, an August 2015 compilation of 30 Rare titles for the Xbox One, alongside documentary-style videos about the game's development and its planned sequel. The latter was canceled {{after a few months}} of production due to both poor sales of the original and Microsoft's new focus on games for its Kinect peripheral.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. <b>Bright</b> <b>and</b> distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E
5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
