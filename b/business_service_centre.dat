40|$|The Thesis is {{conducted}} based on {{analysis of a}} business shared service centre, all factors to consider before the establishment, its scope, model, {{and the most important}} is to see advantages as well as to realize the shortcomings of this kind of business model. The country which is analyzed is the Czech Republic; more particular is the city of Prague; and the company is SAP <b>Business</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Centre</b> of Europe (BSCE). In this Thesis, first of all, the PEST (Political, Economic, Social and Technology) environmental analysis has been conducted. The work continues with the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of the company SAP AG, from which, we can see that opening a SAP BSCE is a part of SAP strategy which supposes to benefit the company. In order to establish the BSCE, the SAP management board has to consider the factors such as Organization, People, Processes and IT Infrastructure. After analyzing approximately 20 cities in Europe, SAP has chosen Prague as the best mix of quality and costs factors. SAP BSCE covers the functions of Human Resource and Finance and Administration, which provide services to internal and external customers of many countries in Europe, Middle East, and Africa. SAP BSCE has brought back many advantages such as cost-savings, high quality service, business availability and flexibility, and business transparency and legal compliance. On the other hand, there are still many short-comings, such as the high turn-over rate of staff, difficulties in harmonization and standardization of processes and IT infrastructure, and how to prove the quality of service. Despite these challenges, SAP BSCE has put efforts into trying to overcome these problems. At the end of the Thesis, as per analysis of SAP financial results of business activities during the crisis, it is proven the setting up a shared service centre was a good decision of SAP and it paid off with the contribution to help SAP overcome the impacts of crisis...|$|E

40|$|The Local <b>Business</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Centre</b> (LBSC) {{programme}} {{launched by}} the government of the Republic of South Africa in 1995 to provide business development services to small business, moreso in the Black communities, did not live up to expectations. This is according to the responses of a sample of 400 small business owners who were researched regarding the effectiveness of the LBSC programme, with a usable questionnaire response rate of 37. 8 %. The purpose of this ex post facto research, conducted in 2006 and 2007, was to evaluate the impact of the LBSC programme on small businesses in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. The results will assist in developing strategies for the delivery of business development services (BDSs) that would meet the expectations of all stakeholders. This is the challenge facing South Africa. The better-known service centres include the Small Business Development Centres in the United States of America and Business Link in the United Kingdom of Great Britain; and international brands like the Enterprise Development Centres sponsored by the International Labour Organisation. These centres provide business development services such as information, basic management training and referrals to more advanced services. The quantitative research was based on a questionnaire consisting of 42 variables and one open-ended question. The questionnaire was sent to 400 small business owners who had received counselling from the LBSCs. The questionnaire was developed from a literature review on service centres in the developed and developing world; the qualitative studies of Bloch&Daze in 2000 and Urban-Econ in 2002 which were conducted nationally, and structured qualitative interviews with former government officials and existing LBSC owners. The open-ended question solicited respondents to specify the type of service centre that would meet their requirements. According to the four-point Likert scale used, most respondents “disagree” that the LBSCs were effective, and the rating was just shy of the 2. 5 median. Three factors emerged from the responses: “capacity and professionalism”; “productive relationship” and “empowering association”. According to a t-test and an analysis of variance (Anova), there was no statistical difference between the means and mid-points of the independent variables for the three factors which indicated “disagree”, except “capacity and professionalism” and “empowering association” in terms of turnover. The independent variables included the age of the SMME owner, the qualifications of the owner, the turnover, the number of employees and the age of the entity. The researcher has recommended an eight-point SMME development strategy as the basis to introduce a new generation of service centres to stimulate entrepreneurship and provide business development services. The recommended eight-point strategy will also assist to assess new business development services centres being introduced by various governments. Thesis (DCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to describe}} {{the extent to which}} the government has assisted small, medium and micro enterprises (SMME's) in the Western Cape clothing industry. The ultimate aim is to propose a way forward in the light of what the government has done so far in terms of SMME's promotion since 1994 and the recent economic and social developments in South Africa and abroad. The study is targeted at SMME's that are owned by previously disadvantaged communities in the Western Cape metropolitan area. It does not focus on well-established SMME's. The government's SMME's promotion strategy emphasises the need to economically empower previously disadvantaged communities through measures such as SMME's promotion in those communities. It is for this reason that I chose to research this category of SMME's. The observation of this dissertation is that the government has been successful in coming up with the strategy for SMME's promotion and setting up structures for implementation in order to overcome barriers to the growth of SMME's in South Africa. However, there is still work to be done towards the success of these SMME's with primary responsibility falling on local <b>business</b> <b>service</b> <b>centres</b> as grassroots organisations.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether the}} {{tendency}} for Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Services</b> to concentrate in Sydney and Melbourne implies a similar spatial bias in the propensity for innovation across the Australian economy. The various models of business innovation are reviewed. The traditional Schumpeterian view {{is characterized by a}} strategic leap in customer offer, based on some new break-through technology. Alternatively, innovation may proceed in incremental or organic fashion. Other conceptual frameworks for analyzing innovation conceive of it as a network process, which is becoming more prevalent as corporate value chains &# 039;unbundle&# 039; with improved communication technologies, reduced barriers to capital transfers and new techniques for managing transaction risk. Regardless of which model of innovation is applied, Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Services</b> have a critical role in sparking and facilitating innovation. This is gathering potency as the &# 039;thinking part&# 039; of the value chain becomes increasingly separable from the &# 039;making&# 039; and &# 039;distribution&# 039; aspects of production. While Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Services</b> are vital to successful innovation in the modern economy, they continue to operate within primitive commercial models where social networks and trust based relationships are paramount in successful client service. The innovation catalyst function of Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Services</b> may be prone to a significant distance deterioration effect, because of the difficulty of maintaining the requisite social relationships over an extended geography. This, in turn, suggests an emergent core and periphery geography in innovation. The thesis examines this hypothesis through both demand and supply side analyses. The latter involves a random sample survey of approximately 100 Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Service</b> firms in Melbourne. This confirms the tendency of these firms to favour local clients. The demand side analysis includes case studies of Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Service</b> use and innovation outcomes amongst six metropolitan Melbourne based firms and six similar firms based some two hours drive away in Bendigo. In line with the hypothesis, the metropolitan cases show much stronger engagement with knowledge intensive advisory services than their counterparts in regional Victoria. The demand side analysis also includes a quantitative component, which is exploratory in nature owing to data limitations. It considers how innovation outcomes in manufacturing change with increasing distance from key Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Service</b> <b>centres.</b> Innovation outcomes are proxied by variations in manufacturing worker wages. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis of distance deterioration in the innovation role of Advanced <b>Business</b> <b>Services...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of China Mobile â one of Chinaâs pioneer ânational championsâ, {{and one of the}} worldâs largest telecom companies â through the lens of Global Financial Networks, focusing on the role of advanced <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> financial <b>centres,</b> and offshore jurisdictions in economic development. It demonstrates that despite being a domestic company, China Mobile is plugged firmly into the Global Financial Networks, with incorporation in Hong Kong, cross-listing in Hong Kong and New York, and opaque offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. Global advanced <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms, with Goldman Sachs in the lead, have been instrumental in the very conception of China Mobile in 1997, and its subsequent expansion, thus helping the Chinese government consolidate and modernize the whole telecom sector. The case study highlights the position of Hong Kong as an onshore-offshore financial centre intermediating between global financial markets and Mainland China, and underwriting the reputation of Chinaâs ânational championsâ. The analysis also points to the advantages of Beijing over Shanghai as a command centre of state owned and controlled enterprises, acting as a magnet for advanced <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> The relevance of the GFNs to China, a latecomer on the stage of financial globalization, highlights the scope for applying the concept {{to the rest of the}} world, and its potential contribution to economic geography...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the quest to build {{effective}} strategies to support the development of enterprise {{on the margins of}} the economy, to create jobs and reduce poverty. A core part of this challenge includes grappling with the role of markets in development, and of markets as a critical part of the context in which enterprise development in rural and peri-urban areas can either provide a path out of poverty – or instead serve to lock people into poverty. The thesis explores these issues by tracking the experience of the Mineworkers Development Agency (MDA) as it attempted to grapple with this challenge. MDA is the development wing of South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), and was set up to create jobs and support enterprise development for communities affected by the loss of jobs on the mines. The thesis covers a fourteen-year period in MDA’s history, from its inception in 1988 until 2002. It tracks the learning process across several phases in the development of MDA’s approach. These included the development of worker co-operatives, the establishment of <b>business</b> <b>service</b> <b>centres,</b> value-chain work in the craft sector, and the commercialization of a juice product from the indigenous marula berry. In the process, MDA engaged with an emergent paradigm in the development sector called ‘Making Markets Work for the Poor’. Can markets really be made to work for the poor? Or even just made to work ‘better’ for the poor? Or is the process of inclusion in markets inexorably and inevitably one of making the poor work for markets? The thesis explores these issues in the context of MDA’s experience, locating this within a wider set of theoretical concerns over the role of markets in society, {{and the ways in which}} societies have protected themselves from the negative impacts of the development of market economies. It draws on wider political economy approaches to argue that markets are institutions that are socially constructed, and explores what scope there might therefore be to construct them differently. While recognising the importance of social protection, the thesis argues that there is a need to go beyond defensive strategies aimed at protecting society from markets, to identify new terms of engagement within markets to shape markets, and to harness their wealth-creating potential in ways that have different distributional consequences, as part of a long-term agenda of eradicating poverty...|$|R

The major source of innovation and renewal in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is regarded to be knowledge/competencies/intangible assets.
