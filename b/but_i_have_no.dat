25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

60|$|His breath smelt {{strongly}} of liquor, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{right to}} object, and he dropped heavily into the seat.|$|R
25|$|It wasn't a retainer. It was $50,000 not to work. Sir Frank didn't know it <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{intention}} of working.|$|R
500|$|With reports speculating that Costa {{wanting to}} leave Chelsea, Costa affirmed on 2 June 2015 after Chelsea's post-season tour {{that he had}} no desire to leave London, saying, [...] "It's always a bit more {{difficult}} in the first season for adaptation, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> reason to leave this place, I love it, the fans love me, and I want to stay. It’s really good to come in the first season [...] and win two things [...] Next year I’ll be ready to come back and, hopefully, win a couple more trophies." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus {{because of}} {{internal}} conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, {{the future of}} Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether {{there would be a}} third album, or if the split would become permanent. [...] "I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot," [...] Jordison protested. [...] "I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> fucking idea what he's talking about." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller joined Manchester United {{for free}} on 1 July 2004, and scored his first {{goal for the}} club on 26 October 2004 against Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup. After {{the start of his}} career for the Red Devils, he found first-team {{opportunities}} rare {{towards the end of the}} 2004–05 season. He was given a rare first-team start in January 2005 in an FA Cup tie against non-league Exeter City, but turned in a poor performance and was substituted in the second half. In his entire time at the club he made only 22 first-team appearances. Miller later commented that [...] "Man Utd didn't work out <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> regrets about giving it a go." ...|$|E

500|$|Shanina's {{personal}} life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, {{she wrote in}} her diary, [...] "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [...] has been killed... He loved me, I know, and I him... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> close [...] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she [...] "is flogging into her head that [...] loves" [...] a man named Nikolai, although he [...] "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote {{that she did not}} think about marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E
500|$|Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put {{in charge}} of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly {{regarded}} for his technical and administrative ability but rated only [...] "average" [...] in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as fast as I could, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, 15-year-old Cruz {{made her}} acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano's song [...] "La Fuerza del Destino". Between 1990 and 1997, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco's talk show La Quinta Marcha, a {{programme}} that was hosted by teenagers, {{aimed at a}} teenage audience. She also played in the [...] "Elle et lui" [...] episode of an erotic French TV series called Série rose in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1992, Cruz made her feature film debut at 18 as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film, Jamón, jamón. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, {{a young woman who}} is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. People magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became [...] "a major sex symbol". In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Cruz commented that [...] "it was a great part, but...I wasn't really ready for the nudity. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life." [...] Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes noted that Cruz [...] "became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent". When Rose asked Cruz if she was concerned about how she would be perceived after her role in the film, Cruz replied, [...] "I just knew I had to do the complete opposite." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was indeed}} {{no match for}} her. He turned to me appealingly, his brows bent, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> mind to meddle. He swung back to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{just turned}} in for half-an-hour: {{it seems that}} {{everybody}} does, so I thought <b>I</b> must. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea that you were feeble that way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is scandalous!" [...] {{the colonel}} exclaimed. [...] "I {{did not expect}} that {{everything}} would be found right, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea of such villainy as this!" ...|$|R
2500|$|He also noted: [...] "Another requisite, in my opinion, is {{that the}} ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> use for them in a fictitious ghost story." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he was congratulated by locals on his fluent German, he responded: [...] "I {{learned it}} well when I {{spent a year}} at Bergen Belsen". Asked about {{competing}} in Germany, the Holocaust survivor said: [...] "I don't say I have to hate Germans. Of course not the younger generation, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> special sympathy for the older generation who {{have been accused of}} what happened in the Nazi period." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many American {{soldiers}} {{who had been in}} My Lai during the massacre accepted personal responsibility for the loss of civilian lives. Some of them expressed regrets without acknowledging any personal guilt, as, for example, Ernest Medina, who said, [...] "I have regrets for it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> guilt over it because I didn't cause it. That's not what the military, particularly the United States Army, is trained for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well done, my good Jinjur; I admire {{your energy}} and judgment. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea a monkey could look so comical as this monkey did {{while he was}} being bathed." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{had seen}} TV at the World's Fair, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea this existed in New York. CBS was a radio network," [...] Buch told a {{reporter}} from the Asheville Citizen-Times in 2008.|$|R
2500|$|Baldwin's {{vice presidential}} run, and Peroutka's {{withdrawal}} from the national Constitution Party, led to active 2006 speculation that Baldwin would seek the presidential nomination in 2008. Baldwin responded in October that [...] "I have learned to never say never, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> desire to run. [...] would require several 'miraculous' signs of reassurance that, frankly, I cannot see happening. However, I am always open to God's will." [...] He repeated this stance through March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Abram cannot sleep, tossing {{and turning}} {{from side to}} side... Finally his wife Sarah inquires: [...] "Abram, what's bothering you?" [...] / [...] "I owe Moishe 20 roubles, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> money. What shall I do?" [...] / Sarah bangs on the flimsy wall and shouts to the neighbors: [...] "Moishe! My Abram still owes you 20 roubles? Well he isn't giving them back!" [...] / Turning to her husband, she says reassuringly: [...] "Now go to sleep and let Moishe stay awake!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 May 2010, Modrić {{was awarded}} with a new six-year {{contract}} that ran until 2016; he said, [...] "Tottenham Hotspur gave me my chance in the Premier League and I {{want to go on}} to achieve great success here with them. Yes, there have been enquiries from other big clubs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interest in going anywhere. Last season's top-four finish was an indication of where we are as a Club and I feel I can continue to improve and go on to achieve everything I want to at Spurs".|$|E
6000|$|... "But what need {{can there}} be for them, Ronald? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard that bands of {{discharged}} soldiers and others make travelling insecure; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{idea that it was}} necessary to have an armed escort." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time {{to finish}} my sentence. He struck at me with both hands like an angry cat, and, {{springing}} back into the room, he slammed {{the door with a}} crash in my face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I assure you, aunt,' said <b>I,</b> 'I <b>have</b> {{been quite}} unhappy myself all night, {{to think of}} Dora's being so. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> other {{intention}} than {{to speak to her}} tenderly and lovingly about our home-affairs.' ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Noreen Gosch's account, she {{was awakened}} around 2:30a.m. {{one morning in}} March 1997 by a knock at her {{apartment}} door. Waiting outside was Johnny Gosch, now 27, accompanied by a man {{she had never seen}} before. Gosch said she immediately recognized her son, who opened his shirt to reveal a birthmark on his chest. [...] "We talked about an hour or an hour and a half. He was with another man, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea who the person was. Johnny would look over to the other person for approval to speak," [...] says Gosch. [...] "He didn't say where he is living or where he was going." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iravatham Mahadevan, another {{historian}} who supports the Dravidian hypothesis, says, [...] "we may hopefully {{find that the}} proto-Dravidian roots of the Harappan language and South Indian Dravidian languages are similar. This is a hypothesis [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> illusions that I will decipher the Indus script, nor do I have any regret". According to Mahadevan, a stone celt discovered in Mayiladuthurai (Tamil Nadu) has the same markings {{as that of the}} symbols of the Indus script. The celt dates to early 2nd millennium BCE, post-dating Harappan decline. Mahadevan considers this as evidence of the same language being used by the neolithic people of south India and the late Harappans.|$|E
2500|$|Both Billington and Paul Taylor (in The Independent) {{give the}} {{production}} 4 out of 5 stars, while Charles Spencer, reviewing the production in The Daily Telegraph, like other critics making inevitable comparisons {{with the original}} production, rates it as [...] "equally fine, with Michael Gambon and David Bradley rising magnificently to the benchmark set by their illustrious predecessors," [...] but points out that he too does not feel that he fully understands it: [...] "Even after three decades I cannot claim fully to understand this haunting drama that proves by turns funny, scary, and resonantly poetic, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt that {{it is one of}} the handful of indisputable modern classics that Pinter has written, and a piece that will haunt and tantalise the memory of all who see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{got your}} note just in time," [...] he remarked. [...] "I knew {{of course that}} {{you were at the}} Montressor's, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea that it was a music hall party afterwards. Are you all here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{knew that}} you were in Paris, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea that we should meet, {{certainly}} not like this. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a dear friend to whose apartments I shall go at once. She is a milliner." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke with}} an air of fond {{proprietorship}} which made my heart tremble, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> more words left with which to fight my battle. My strength was gone; I did not even try to withdraw my hand.|$|R
