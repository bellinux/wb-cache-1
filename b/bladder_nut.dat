40|$|European <b>bladder</b> <b>nut</b> has its {{northern}} limit in Poland and is legally protected. Climatic conditions, edible seeds attractive for small animals and seed dormancy {{to a large}} extent affect its restocking under natural conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine conditions for seed dormancy release. Nuts dried after collection to ca 11 % of moisture content (fresh weight basis) may be stored without loss of seed viability for over 1 year in a cold store at the temperature of - 3 o C. For the purpose of seed dormancy release nuts need to be stratified. Seed dormancy release was found highest after the application of warm-followed-by-cold stratification, first for 4 - 6 weeks at the temperature of 15 o C or at cyclically alternating temperature of 10 ~ 20 o C (24 + 24 h/cycle), followed by 16 - 18 weeks at 3 o C. Seeds germinate at 3 o C with the same rate as at cyclically alternating temperature of 3 ~ 15 o C (16 + 8 h/day). Drying of nuts at room temperature to approx. 11 % during the warm stratification phase (after 2 or 4 weeks) and further stratification resulted in a significant increase in seed germinability. In some seed lots scarification of nuts (dried during the warm stratification phase) contributes to a further significant increase of seed germinability...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} bladder cancer after nephro-ureterectomy (NUT) and de-termine the potential risk factors of bladder recurrence in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively assessed 37 patients with UUT-UC including a significant follow-up after NUT of 34 months (range 12 - 120 months). The median age {{of the population was}} 72 years (range 48 - 83 years). Patients with a previous his-tory of bladder cancer, concomitant diagnosis of bladder tumor and UUT-UC; or a metastatic UUT-UC were excluded from the study. Results: Out of these 37 patients, 17 presented a bladder recur-rence within an average time of 12 months (range 3 to 31 months) after the NUT. In 94 % of the cases, bladder recurrence occurred within the first 24 months following the NUT. Histological dis-tribution was: 13 Ta tumors (76 %), 2 pT 1 tumors (11. 7 %); 11 patients had a high stage lesion (76 %), whereas 4 patients had a low stage lesion (23. 5 %). As regards the anatomo-pathological characteristics of the UUT-UC, the supra iliac localization of the tumor is a significant risk factor of bladder recurrence (p = 0. 04). Conclusion: <b>Bladder</b> recurrence after <b>NUT</b> occurred frequently and could have possibly been under-estimated. The use of intra-vesical instillation of Mitomycin C af...|$|R
