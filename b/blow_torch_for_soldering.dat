40|$|One layer kenaf core {{particleboard}} {{was treated}} {{with one of the}} advanced fire retardants, Dricon®. The percentage of 8 % (w/w) and 12 % (w/w) of Dricon® were incorporated into three different board densities (350 kg/m 3, 450 kg/m 3 and 550 kg/m 3) which were fabricated with three resin loadings (w/w) of urea formaldehyde (8 %, 10 % and 12 %). Each of treated and untreated particleboard has been tested with <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> and fire propagation tests. The fire propagation test was evaluated by using performance index (I), which indicates the level of heat release of the tested boards. <b>Blow</b> <b>torch</b> test resulted the decreasing of sample’s weight loss of the Dricon®’s sample than the control samples. Fire propagation test indicated lower value of performances index or lower heat release of the treated samples compared with the untreated ones. </p...|$|R
50|$|On 26 June 1995 {{there was}} a serious fire at the Grand Hotel. The fire started when workmen had been repainting, using <b>blow</b> <b>torches</b> to strip off old paint.

50|$|In {{the same}} period Burri was also working on the Ferri (Irons), creations made out of metal sheets cut, and welded by <b>Blow</b> <b>torch,</b> to aim the general balance of the elements. The best known {{application}} of this procedure was reached in the Plastiche (Plastics) during the Sixties, when a gradual critic openness towards Burri’s art showed up in Italy as well.|$|R
50|$|When Superman {{is trying}} to get to Lex Luthor's {{underground}} hideout, he is subjected to machine gun fire, a giant <b>blow</b> <b>torch,</b> and is frozen in ice. A tiny fraction of this footage was used in the theatrical version Superman II (directed by Richard Lester), in the scene where Superman's powers are stripped away by the molecule chamber in the Fortress of Solitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> non-electronic {{applications}} <b>soldering</b> <b>torches</b> use a flame {{rather than}} a soldering tip to heat solder. Soldering torches are often powered by butane and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel <b>torches</b> suitable <b>for</b> much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, can be used <b>for</b> <b>soldering</b> pipes and other fairly large objects either {{with or without a}} soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch by directly applying the open flame.|$|R
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>soldering</b> {{semiconductor}} materials, e.g. {{die attachment}} of silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide, {{it is important}} that the solder contains no impurities that could cause doping in the wrong direction. <b>For</b> <b>soldering</b> n-type semiconductors, solder may be doped with antimony; indium may be added <b>for</b> <b>soldering</b> p-type semiconductors. Pure tin and pure gold can be used.|$|R
50|$|Sous-vide {{low-temperature}} {{cooking is}} carried out by vacuum-sealing food {{in a plastic bag}} placed in a water bath or combi steamer with precisely controlled temperature for a long time. The food may then be browned by heating the surfaces to a much higher temperature of perhaps 200 C, using a roasting pan or a <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> prior to serving. A dishwasher has been used to cook salmon.|$|R

50|$|In the day {{following}} the accident, the Indian Navy supplied divers, who {{dove into the}} flood waters with <b>blow</b> <b>torches</b> to try to rescue {{people who might have}} been trapped in air pockets in the sunken carriages. Reportedly, several people were rescued this way. The Indian Army and Air Force also provided assistance with rescue, medical and heavy lift helicopters, by collecting bodies and maintaining security at the site.|$|R

50|$|Some {{commentators}} {{compared the}} military`s requests with fantastical science fiction.They have repeated {{passages from the}} military briefing documents where the weapon was described as like a long distance <b>blow</b> <b>torch.</b> It was described as being able to erode the morale of enemies by showing the USA {{had the ability to}} set suspects on fire from a distance. It was also described as being able to incapacitate vehicles by bursting their tires, at lower intensity levels.|$|R
50|$|Some core {{materials}} can be bent {{into a number}} of shapes to give variety and uniqueness to a weapon. A common way to bend a PVC core is with a <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> or kitchen stove; however, heat guns or boiling water are preferred by some as these methods deliver even heat, to prevent burning or weakening of the core. Rattan is generally soaked in water and then moulded to fit a shape.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, DeLong became {{involved}} in the investigation of the Chicago Tylenol murders, in which seven people died from potassium cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. Although no one was ever charged in the poisonings, the incident led to new packaging for over-the-counter medication and federal anti-tampering laws. Regarding the incident, DeLong stated that [...] "You can thank the Tylenol killer for the fact that it now takes a <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> to get into a bottle of Tylenol." ...|$|R

50|$|A joint {{between two}} members aligned {{approximately}} {{in the same}} plane. Butt welding can also be achieved through traditional <b>blow</b> <b>torches</b> in {{the most common form}} of butt joints, a process that uses some variety of flux, usually a tin-based solder and precise hand-eye coordination that is common for hand-made boxes of copper, brass, and silver. There are two types of butt welding; one is carried out by smiting and another is carried out by welding two work pieces by non-overlapping.|$|R
