50|$|In sailing naval warfare, raking fire is fire {{directed}} {{parallel to}} the long axis of an enemy ship from ahead or astern. Although each shot is directed against a smaller target profile than by shooting broadside and thus more likely to miss the target ship to {{one side or the}} other, an individual cannon shot that hits will pass through more of the ship, thereby increasing damage to the hull, sails, cannon and crew. In addition, the targeted ship will have fewer (if any) guns able to return fire. A stern rake tends to be more damaging than a <b>bow</b> <b>rake</b> because the shots are not deflected by the curved (and strengthened) bow, and because disabling the exposed rudder at the stern would render the target unable to steer and thus manoeuvre. However, achieving a position to rake a single enemy ship was usually very difficult unless the opponent was unable to manoeuvre due to damage to the sails or rudder; it was easier if a ship was constrained by its position in the line of battle.|$|E
50|$|Reefing sail {{just long}} enough to weather the short squall, Constellation hardly paused but the same was not to be for L'Insurgente as her topmast snapped and slowed her to the onrushing Constellation. Captain Barreaut ordered L'Insurgente to lay up and {{prepared}} to fight. Constellation was outfitted with 24 pounder guns that caused her to lean too much to lee due to topweight and thus had to surrender the weather gage to L'Insurgente. She was refitted with 18-pounder long guns in her next refit. L'Insurgente raised the French Tricolor and Captain Barreaut tried to ask for parley. Captain Truxtun refused to answer as his orders were to attack any French warship or privateer and answered when his last gun could be brought to bear. American warships of this period fired for the hull as did the British and each of the 24 pounders had been double shotted. L'Insurgente fired as per her training at the Constellations masts and rigging. Constellations masts were saved when her sail was reduced taking pressure off the damaged mast. L'Insurgente was devastated by Constellations first broadside with many dead and others deserting their guns. L'Insurgente tried to board and slowed to close but this allowed Constellation to shoot ahead and crossed her bows for a <b>bow</b> <b>rake</b> with another broadside. Constellation crossed to windward and L'Insurgente turned to follow with both crews now exchanging port broadsides instead of starboard. One of Constellations 24 pounders smashed through the hull of L'Insurgente. L'Insurgente's 12 pounders were not equal to the same task against Constellations hull. Captain Barreaut had been shown one of Constellations 24 pound cannonballs and understood that he was in a completely unequal contest with sails down and nothing comparable to reply with many already dead and wounded. He struck colors— the first major victory by an American-designed and -built warship.|$|E
5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her <b>bow,</b> <b>raking</b> {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her <b>bow</b> and <b>rake</b> her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's <b>bow</b> again to <b>rake</b> her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|R

He calls it the Lisbon bean-pod, from its exact resemblance to that vegetable, and affirms it to be the most curious of European craft, which we can readily believe. [...] "Take a well-grown bean-pod," [...] he says, [...] "and put it on its convex edge, and then put two little sticks, one in the centre and one at the <b>bows,</b> <b>raking</b> forward, for the masts, and another in the bows, steeving up, for the bowsprit, and another astern for a boomkin or outrigger, and then you have before you the boat in question."

5|$|Blackwood's {{attack was}} so {{successful}} that by dawn on 31 March Guillaume Tell had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard, considerably reducing {{the speed at which}} Decrés could travel. The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, but Penelope had lost only one man killed and three wounded, and was almost undamaged. British reinforcements were now arriving from the south: the 64-gun HMS Lion under Captain Dixon had received Minorcas warning at 01:00 and immediately sailed in pursuit, sending the brig on to Captain Sir Edward Berry in HMS Foudroyant, who lay some distance to leeward. By 05:00, Dixon was close enough to engage, passing between Penelope and Guillaume Tell and firing a triple-shotted broadside into the port side of the French ship. Shooting ahead of the now sluggish Guillaume Tell, Lion crossed its opponent's bows and shot away the jib boom, allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the <b>bow,</b> <b>raking</b> the French ship from one end while Penelope did the same to the other. During these manoeuvres, Dixon's ship had briefly become entangled with Guillaume Tells rigging, and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled.|$|R
2500|$|As Tamise and Santa Margarita fought, Unicorn {{continued}} {{the pursuit of}} Tribune. Without the need to support the slower Tamise, Moulston was able to spread more sail and Tribune pulled ahead of her opponent during the afternoon the ships passing Tuskar Rock on the Wexford Coast. The French frigate's stern-chasers continued to inflict damage on Unicorns rigging, at one point snatching away the main topsail {{and it was only}} when night fell, and the wind with it, that Williams was able to gain on the French ship through the use of studding sails. At 22:30, following a chase of [...] northwards into St George's Channel, Unicorn was finally able to pull alongside Tribune. For 35 minutes the frigates battered at one another from close range. Under cover of smoke, Moulston then attempted to escape by pulling Tribune back and turning across Unicorns stern, seeking to rake the British frigate and move to windward. Realising Moulston's intent, Williams hauled his sails around, effectively throwing Unicorn in reverse. As the British ship sailed suddenly backwards she [...] crossed Tribunes <b>bow,</b> <b>raking</b> the French ship with devastating effect. From this vantage point the fire from Unicorn succeeded in collapsing the foremast and mainmast on Tribune and shooting away the mizen topmast, rendering the French ship unmanageable. With no hope of escape and casualties rapidly mounting, the wounded Moulston surrendered to Williams.|$|R
