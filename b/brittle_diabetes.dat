To assess the role of inappropriate type, amount, or timing of insulin treatment and the route of administration as a cause of severe brittleness six patients with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, which provides a high degree of optimisation of dosage with exogenous insulin in stable diabetics. The glycaemic control achieved during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was compared with that during continuous intramuscular insulin infusion. Six patients with non-brittle diabetes were also treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. These patients achieved the expected improvement in glycaemic control (mean +/- SD plasma glucose concentration 5. 1 +/- 2. 3 mmol/l (92 +/- 41 mg/ 100 ml)), but not the patients with <b>brittle</b> <b>diabetes</b> remained uncontrolled with continuous subcutaneous infusion (13. 6 +/- 5. 8 mmol/ 1 (245 +/- 105 mg/ 100 ml) compared with 10. 3 +/- 4. 1 mmol/l (186 +/- 74 mg/ 100 ml) during treatment with optimised conventional subcutaneous injections).

Rapid and adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery by blood vessels improves islet engraftment and function. The present report evaluated a potentially beneficial effect of adult human blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) on islet graft vascularisation and function. METHODS: Human BOEC, 5 [*]×[*] 10 (5), were co-transplanted with a rat marginal-islet graft under the kidney capsule of hyperglycaemic NOD severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, and the effect on metabolic outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: Although vessel density remained unaffected, co-transplantation of islets with BOEC resulted in a significant and specific improvement of glycaemia and increased plasma C-peptide. Moreover, in contrast to control mice, BOEC recipients displayed reduced beta cell death and increases in body weight, beta cell proliferation and graft-vessel and beta cell volume. In vivo cell tracing demonstrated that BOEC remain {{at the site of}} transplantation and do not expand. The potential clinical applicability was underscored by the observed metabolic benefit of co-transplanting islets with BOEC derived from a type 1 diabetes patient.

More accurate methods to assess islet viability would be extremely useful in designing target interventions for islet cytoprorection and in reducing the number of islets required to achieve insulin independence. Here we report on an application of calorimetry to evaluate the metabolic response of pancreatic islets to glucose stimulation. A significant increase in metabolic heat was produced by islet samples when consecutively subjected to 2. 8 and 16. 3 mmol L- 1 glucose. Under these glucose concentrations, 1000 islets released average heat values of 9. 16 +/- 0. 71 mJ and 14. 90 +/- 1. 21 mJ over 50 min, respectively. Additionally, the glucose stimulation indexes were 1. 67 +/- 0. 30 for insulin. 1. 72 +/- 0. 13 for heat and 2. 91 +/- 0. 50 for lactate, raising the important possibility of substituting the secreted insulin index/ratio by the index/ratio of the heat released in the evaluation of Langerhans islets viability for transplantation. Altogether, Our results demonstrate the applicability of calorimetry to assess the quality of isolated pancreatic islets and to study vital islet functions. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Pancreatic islet {{transplantation}} {{into the}} liver provides a possibility to treat selected patients with <b>brittle</b> type 1 <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. However, massive early b-cell death increases {{the number of}} islets needed to restore glucose homeostasis. Moreover, late dysfunction and death contribute to the poor long-term results of islet transplantation on insulin independence. Studies {{in recent years have}} identified early and late challenges for transplanted pancreatic islets, including an instant bloodmediated inflammatory reaction when exposing human islets to the blood microenvironment in the portal vein and the low oxygenated milieu of islets transplanted into the liver. Poor revascularization of remaining intact islets combined with severe changes in the gene expression of islets transplanted into the liver contributes to late dysfunction. Strategies to overcome these hurdles have been developed, and some of these interventions are now even tested in clinical trials providing a hope to improve results in clinical islet transplantation. In parallel, experimental and clinical studies have, based on the identified problems with the liver site, evaluated the possibility of change of implantation organ in order to improve the results. Sitespecific differences clearly exist in the engraftment of transplanted islets, and a more thorough characterization of alternative locations is needed.

40|$|Transplantation of islets of Langerhans is an {{effective}} treatment option for patients with <b>brittle</b> type 1 <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. This treatment restores glucose control and also reduces hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, the outcome from islet isolations is variable, and many preparations do not yield sufficient islet number or islet quality. The aim of this thesis was to improve the isolation procedure, thereby making more preparations available for clinical transplantation. A well-established method for pathogen inactivation was applied to human serum used in the islet isolation process. Evaluation of isolated islets stored in medium supplemented with pathogen-inactivated serum showed that pathogen inactivation did not have negative effects. These findings will enable the use of human serum in clinical cell transplantation programs, while simultaneously increasing patient safety. Pre-incubation of islets prior to gradient separation is an established standard {{in the field of}} islet isolation. Through a reduction in the pre-incubation step, isolation time could be reduced by almost an hour without affecting the isolation outcome. A commercially available protease enzyme, clostripain, was added to the enzyme blend used in islet isolation. Addition of clostripain was found {{to increase the number of}} islets isolated as well as the purified tissue volume and fulfillment of transplant criteria. Use of clostripain should help to increase the number of successful isolations. A newly developed pancreas-specific preservation solution, I-Let protect, was evaluated. As compared to standard preservation solutions, it can be used in situations of prolonged cold ischemic time without affecting the isolation outcome or islet functionality. I-Let protect can also be used in establishing a protocol that would eliminate the need for night- time isolations.

40|$|Transplanting {{pancreatic}} islets {{into the}} liver through the portal vein {{is currently the}} most common procedure in clinical islet transplantations for treating patients with <b>brittle</b> type 1 <b>diabetes.</b> However, most islet grafts fail within a 5 -year period necessitating retransplantation. The vascular connections are disrupted at islet isolation and implanted islets depend on diffusion of oxygen and nutrients in the immediate posttransplantation period. Rapid and efficient revascularization is of utmost importance for the survival and long-term function of transplanted islets. In this thesis, {{the influence of the}} implantation microenvironment for islet engraftment and function was studied. Islets were transplanted into the liver, the renal subcapsular site or the pancreas. Islets implanted into the liver contained fewer glucagon-positive cells than islets implanted to the kidney and endogenous islets. Intraportally transplanted islets responded with insulin and glucagon release to secretagogues, but only when stimulated through the hepatic artery. Thus, the intrahepatic grafts were selectively revascularized from the hepatic artery. The vascular density in human islets transplanted into the liver of athymic mice was markedly lower when compared to human islets grafted to the kidney. Islets implanted into their physiological environment, the pancreas, were markedly better revascularized. Insulin content, glucose-stimulated insulin release, (pro) insulin biosynthesis and glucose oxidation rate were markedly decreased in transplanted islets retrieved from the liver, both when compared to endogenous and transplanted islets retrieved from the pancreas. Only minor changes in metabolic functions were observed in islets implanted into the pancreas when compared to endogenous islets. The present findings demonstrate that the microenvironment has a major impact on the engraftment of transplanted islets. Elucidating the beneficial factors that promote engraftment would improve the survival and long-term function of transplanted islets. Ultimately, islet transplantation may be provided to an increased number of patients with type 1 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{transplantation}} of islets of Langerhans is {{a viable}} means to maintain control of blood sugar levels and {{reduce the risk of}} hypoglycemia in defined populations with <b>brittle</b> type I <b>diabetes</b> mellitus or those requiring pancreatectomy. However, the process of islet isolation is highly variable and not all isolations result in islet numbers or quality suitable for transplantation. This thesis aimed to improve transplantation success through optimization and standardization of the isolation process and to identify pretransplant variables associated with early islet engraftment. A previously disregarded enzyme activity, tryptic-like activity (TLA), has been identified to influence pancreas digestion efficiency and islet isolation success in both the preclinical and clinical situations. For human pancreases, islet isolation success rates improved from 0 % in the lowest TLA group to over 50 % in the highest TLA groups without affecting islet quality. These findings should help standardize evaluation of enzymes for clinical islet isolation. A closed, automated, pump-made gradient system was compared to the open, manual method for islet separation. No differences were observed in expected gradient volumes, islet yields or total purities between the two methods. The pump-made gradient system successfully removed manual influences on density gradient production while fulfilling regulatory requirements for closed system processing. Islet quantification was evaluated with computer-assisted digital imaging analysis (DIA) and a semi-closed assessment system. By using the DIA system method, which measures islet purity and pellet volume instead of manual counting methods, variation in islet counts and purity reduced by almost half. By using a transplant outcome measurement of C-peptide adjusted by blood glucose and creatinine, we identified four pretransplant factors that affect early transplant outcome. Of the four factors, one was related to the organ transport time, one to function of the islets, and two to the transplanted tissue volume. When these four factors were put into a predictive model, it accounted for about 40 % of the transplant outcome. The work contained in this thesis identifies and optimizes a number of critical elements related to islet isolation and transplantation protocols. ...|$|R

Glucose control was stable, with pretransplant fasting and meal tolerance–stimulated glucose levels of 12. 5 6 1. 9 and 20. 0 6 2. 7 mmol/l, respectively, but de...|$|E
40|$|CONCLUSION: Pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy {{conducted}} during a 6 mo period produces better control of diabetes, improvement in nutrition, and overall improvement in {{quality of life}} in patients with tropical calculous pancreatitis. BACKGROUND: Tropical calculous pancreatitis is characterized by abdominal pain, pancreatic calculi, and diabetes. The diabetes in insulin resistant. The <b>brittle</b> <b>diabetes</b> may be owing to defective glucagon secretion and erratic absorption of nutrients. METHODS: Patients with tropical calculous pancreatitis with diabetes and chronic pancreatitis were studied for fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and calcium, liver function, and plasma C-peptide. All patients were given Creon and evaluated for quality of life. RESULTS: Clinical parameters of the patients showed considerable improvement {{at the end of the}} trial. Abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and sense of well being improved. There was a significant reduction in postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin. ...|$|E
40|$|Consultation liaison {{psychiatry}} (CLP) - {{also known}} as psychosomatic medicine - is the psychiatric subspecialty {{that focuses on the}} diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders/difficulties in complex medically ill patients. “Complex medically ill” 1 are patients with active medical, neurological, obstetrical or surgical condition(s) or symptoms, who also meet one of the following criteria: • Patients with an acute or chronic medical, neurological, or surgical illness in which psychiatric morbidity is actively affecting their medical care and/or quality of life. Examples include acute or chronic psychiatric patients with HIV infection, organ transplantation, <b>brittle</b> <b>diabetes,</b> heart disease, renal failure, a terminal illness, cancer, stroke, traumatic brain injury, COPD, high-risk pregnancy, among others. • Patients with a somatoform disorder or with psychological factors affecting a physical condition (“psychosomatic condition”) • Patients with a psychiatric disorder that is the direct consequence of a primary medical condition...|$|E
40|$|A {{young woman}} had severe <b>brittle</b> <b>diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} that was critically unmanageable with all conventional insulin treatment. Continuous subcutaneous and intramuscular infusions of insulin {{also failed to}} control her metabolic instability. Use of a continuous intravenous infusion, however, whereby a portable, variable-rate, battery-operated syringe pump delivered insulin through a subcutaneously tunnelled central venous catheter, resulted in good control. When she was receiving hourly intramuscular insulin injections (a mean of 778 IU daily) mean blood glucose concentrations had been 22. 1 +/- 1. 4 mmol/l (398 +/- 25 mg/ 100 microliters). After she had received the intravenous infusion for one month as an outpatient mean blood glucose concentration was 8. 2 +/- 0. 46 mmol/l (148 +/- 8 mg/ 100 microliters) and only 80 IU insulin daily was required. Follow-up after over five months of use showed that few complications had occurred. The system is simple to use and safe, and the diabetes had been stabilised such that she could enjoy a near-normal life style...|$|E
