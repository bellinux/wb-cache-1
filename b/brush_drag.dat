But we {{held on to}} the canoe, and although we were washed down nearly to the Carson, we managed to push the boat ashore and make a safe landing. We were cold and water-soaked, but safe. The horses made a landing, too, but our saddles were gone, of course. We tied the animals in the sage-brush and there they had to stay for twenty-four hours. We baled out the canoe and ferried over some food and blankets for them, but we slept one more night in the inn before making another venture on our journey.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model of}} a {{rotating}} duct cleaning brush was presented using large deformation elastic theory. The results obtained by the model were compared with the results obtained by a laboratory test. Especially, the effect of air <b>drag</b> on the <b>brush</b> behaviour was considered. The results show that with normal properties of a <b>brush,</b> air <b>drag</b> increases the torque needed and decreases somewhat the contact force between a bristle tip and the duct surface. However, air drag affects only slightly the deflections of the bristles at practical rotating speeds of the brush (300 − 1000 rpm) in a round duct. The modelled and experimental results for torque due to air drag were in good agreement in the case where the brush rotated without contact when a reduced air speed coefficient 0. 5 {{was used in the}} simulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBall roll {{is seen as}} one of {{the first}} {{criterion}} which cause artificial grass pitches to fail performance standards. Previous research has demonstrated that the ball roll distance increased after a seven-year period. However, there is a lack of understanding in the mechanisms causing the ball roll distance to increase with time. During this study, the ball roll distance and free pile height were measured over a twelve-month period on an indoor pitch. The aim was to evaluate the early-life pitch performance and to determine if a correlation existed between ball roll distance and free pile height. The indoor environment protected the measurements from the confounding effects of wind and precipitation, providing a controlled environment in which to assess the effects of mechanical wear from player usage on both ball roll and free pile height. There was a general trend for the ball roll distance to increase and the free pile height to reduce with time. There was a strong, negative correlation (R= - 0. 967) between ball roll distance and free pile height. The ball roll distance increased above the FIFA 2 * limit within the first twelve months of pitch life, however intervening <b>drag</b> <b>brushing</b> the surface was found to reduce ball roll distance to within the requirements, signifying the importance of regular <b>drag</b> <b>brushing.</b> Significant spatial variation (P< 0. 001) existed in ball roll and free pile height between high use and low use areas of the pitch. The study provides strong evidence on the effects of free pile height on the ball roll distance, indicating that pitch owners need effective maintenance to ensure the carpet pile remains upright to maintain ball roll distance to meet performance standards...|$|R

(Middle Left) Cheese is {{stretched}} into thin sheets and filaments as {{a slice of}} pizza is removed. (Middle Right) A knife leaves furrows in mayonnaise, then spreads a thin layer onto a slice of bread. (Far Right) Multicolored toothpaste is squeezed out of a tube in a twisting motion. We present a novel method to simulate codimensional non-Newtonian fluids on simplicial complexes. Our method extends previous work for codimensional incompressible flow to various types of non-Newtonian fluids including both shear thinning and thickening, Bingham plastics, and elastoplastics. We propose a novel time integration scheme for semi-implicitly treating elastic-ity, which when combined with a semi-implicit method for vari-able viscosity alleviates the need for small time steps. Further-more, we propose an improved treatment of viscosity on the rims of thin fluid sheets {{that allows us to}} capture their elusive, visually ap-pealing twisting motion. In order to simulate complex phenomena such as the mixing of colored paint, we adopt a multiple level set framework and propose a discretization on simplicial complexes that facilitates the tracking of material interfaces across codimen-sions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by simulating a wide variety of non-Newtonian fluid phenomena exhibiting various codimensional features...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was a day}} {{of rather}} bright weather for the season. Miss Melbury {{went out for a}} morning walk, and her ever-regardful father, having an hour's leisure, offered to walk with her. The breeze was fresh and quite steady, {{filtering}} itself through the denuded mass of twigs without swaying them, but making the point of each ivy-leaf on the trunks scratch its underlying neighbor restlessly. Grace's lips sucked in this native air of hers like milk. They soon reached a place where the wood ran down into a corner, and went outside it towards comparatively open ground. Having looked round about, they were intending to re-enter the copse when a fox quietly emerged with a <b>dragging</b> <b>brush,</b> trotted past them tamely as a domestic cat, and disappeared amid some dead fern. They walked on, her father merely observing, after watching the animal, [...] "They are hunting somewhere near." ...|$|R
5000|$|Figure with Meat is a 1954 {{painting}} by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon. The figure {{is based on}} the Pope Innocent X portrait by Diego Velázquez; however, in the Bacon painting the Pope is shown as a gruesome figure and placed between two bisected halves of a cow. The carcass hanging in the background is likely derived from Rembrandt's Carcass of Beef, 1657. The painting is in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.According to Mary Louise Schumacher of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, [...] "Bacon appropriated the famous portrait, with its subject, enthroned and draped in satins and lace, his stare stern and full of authority. In Bacon's version, animal carcasses hang at the pope's back, creating a raw and disturbing Crucifixion-like composition. The pope's hands, elegant and poised in Velázquez's version, are rough hewn and gripping the church's seat of authority in apparent terror. His mouth is held in a scream and black striations drip down from the pope's nose to his neck. It's as if Bacon picked up a wide house painting <b>brush</b> and brutishly <b>dragged</b> it over the face. The fresh meat recalls the lavish arrangements of fruits, meats and confections in 17th-century vanitas paintings, which usually carried subtle moralizing messages about the impermanence of life and the spiritual dangers of sensual pleasures. Sometimes, the food itself showed signs of being overripe or spoiled, to make the point. Bacon weds the imagery of salvation, worldly decadence, power and carnal sensuality, and he contrasts those things with his own far more palpable and existential view of damnation".|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{performance}} features of parallel programs, including massive concurrency and nondeterminism, make debugging difficult. To study this issue we have continued to extend Linder, a public domain programming environment supporting Gelernter's tuple space programming model. The first section of this thesis develops protocols to support effective distribution of tuples among disparate processes. This distribution has potential performance advantages, but also complicates the coordination of processes. In the second section, we present protocols that support centralized debugging of tuple space programs. The Linder Tuple Space Debugger (LDB) is a textually-based interactive debugging environment. LDB allows users to set breakpoints on tuples, query the tuple space, and examine the communication history of the system. Users can graphically animate their program's history at breakpoints and after execution using ORNL's ParaGraph, a graphical visualization system. With its unique mixture of history information and interactive control we believe novice users will find LDB a conducive debugging environment.
