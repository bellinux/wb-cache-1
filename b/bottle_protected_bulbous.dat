25|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period {{it has been a}} common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, {{concealed}} shoes, and witch bottles in the structure of a building. Folk magic contends that witch <b>bottles</b> <b>protect</b> against evil spirits and magical attack, and counteract spells cast by witches; they are countermagical devices, the purpose of which is to draw in and trap harmful intentions directed at their owners.|$|R

25|$|This {{was part}} of a broader fear of spirits that might flit into dwellings. Witch bottles were common {{throughout}} Europe – bottles or glass spheres containing a mass of threads, often with charms entangled in them. Its purpose was to draw in and trap evil and negative energy directed at its owner. Folk magic contends that the witch <b>bottle</b> <b>protects</b> against evil spirits and magical attack, and counteracts spells cast by witches, also forestalling the passage into habitations of witches flying about at night. A witch ball was much the same; however, a more light-hearted belief was that the witch saw her distorted face in the curved glass and was frightened away. The term witch ball is probably a corruption of watch ball because it was used as a guard against evil spirits.|$|R
50|$|Saichania {{was over}} five metres long and weighed over two tonnes. It was more robustly built than {{other members of}} the Ankylosauridae. Neck vertebrae, {{shoulder}} girdle, ribs and breast bones were fused or firmly connected. Its body was flat and low-slung, standing on four short legs. The forelimbs were very powerful. The head was <b>protected</b> by <b>bulbous</b> armour tiles. It could defend itself against predators like Tarbosaurus with a tail-club. On the torso keeled osteoderms were present. Saichania bit off plants in its desert habitat with a horny beak and processed them in its wide hindgut.|$|R

40|$|Besides {{the basic}} {{nutritional}} compounds the human diet contains {{a series of}} natural essences, that without having specific nutritional characteristics show biological activity, and can therefore be referred as phytochemical compounds. The red wine is a discrete source of phytochemical compounds positively interacting with the human organism. Among them, quercetin together with t r a n s-resveratrol are the most represented. In particular wine represents {{the main source of}} resveratrol, being fruits and vegetables the most relevant source of quercetin. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine phytoestrogens quercetin and trans-resveratrol in samples of Tuscany red wine. In order to do this, 13 wine samples from 7 producers of the area of Morellino di Scansano (Grosseto, Italy) and 13 wine samples obtained from the Chianti area (Siena, Italy) were analysed and c o m p a r e d. All the analysed samples were directly picked up from the <b>bottle,</b> <b>protected</b> from the sunlight and injected in HPLC system with diode array scan system, without any purification, extraction or filtration procedure of the wine samples. The data we obtained showed that quercetin is highly present in all the samples, with a mean value almost always above 10 mg/L and with a peak of about 20 mg/L. Similarly, the results obtained in the trans-resveratrol assays showed that the values found in samples of the Morellino and Chianti wines were, on the average, slightly higher than those reported in the international literature. In conclusion, from our analyses we observed that the phytoestrogens (quercetin and resveratrol) in the studied Tuscany red wines are well represented and correlate with grapevine variety and the soi...|$|R
50|$|After pressing, {{the wine}} is gravity-fed into oak, computer-temperature-controlled, fermenting tanks, where {{fermentation}} takes 10 to 20 days. Pigeage is done three times daily. From there, the wine is gravity-fed {{down to the}} barrel cellar. It is aged up to 30 months in barrels that are a minimum of 5 years old, before bottling occurs {{during a time when}} there is both a waning moon and a north wind. There is no use of sulfites; instead, the wine is kept under a blanket of nitrogen during racking and <b>bottling</b> to <b>protect</b> it from oxidation. The labels of the domaine have a white spot that will turn grey if the ink in them is subjected to extreme temperatures, thus indicating that the wine may be damaged.|$|R

30|$|The J. curcas latex was {{obtained}} into a sterile amber bottle as liquid exudate from the cut stalk {{of leaves and}} young stem of J. curcas plants grown in Ilara-mokin, Ondo State. The dried seeds of D. tripetala (pepper fruit) were obtained from Relief Market, Oyingbo, Lagos State, while S. aromaticum (clove) buds were bought from King’s Market, Akure, Ondo State. The samples were sorted and stored in air tight glass <b>bottles</b> to <b>protect</b> them from contaminants. All plant samples were authenticated at the Department of Crop, Soil and Pest Management, The Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria. The dried seeds were ground to powder. Powdered samples were sieved to a particle size of 212 – 249  µm and used for the analysis. The entire chemicals used in this research are analytical grade obtained from Sigma Aldrich.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} {{small-scale}} test-burn experiments were conducted at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) {{in order to}} study variables which might affect the fire performance of plastic packages containing flammable liquids. The study demonstrated that manipulation of packaging variables could de-crease the rate of fire growth {{as well as the}} peak rate of heat release by up to 70 %. Critical variables were thermal insulation of bottles within the cartons, the material of construction and size of the bottles, and the use of flame retar-dant in the corrugated packaging. The research identified ways in which plas-tic <b>bottles</b> could be <b>protected</b> but made no attempt to optimize either methods or economics.

50|$|The main beer <b>bottle</b> must be <b>protected</b> {{and avoid}} enemies, {{otherwise}} a life is lost. If all lives are lost {{the game is}} over. Bottles that accompany the main beer bottle cannot ever be destroyed. Once a level has been completed, the player stops by at the pub to buy extra bottles of beer to assist the main beer bottle. Four standard bottles (Stange, Pony, Barbara Braeu and Dunkel) can be purchased from the counter and many others (Can 33CL, Chuebeli, Pokal, Xenon 2 Cannon, plus Bonus Guttere for lives and Speed) can be purchased from the Menu Card. Up to six bottles can accompany the main beer bottle. After each level, the player has the choice of selling the bottles for a small reduction of what they first cost.|$|R
50|$|From infancy, {{the only}} oral motor pattern {{appreciated}} is suck-swallow-breathe. This reflexive way of eating allows infants to feed from birth (from a breast or <b>bottle)</b> while <b>protecting</b> their airway and meeting their nutritional needs (Case-Smith & Humphry, in Case-Smith, 2005). The oral motor patterns required for eating and swallowing solids include tongue lateralization, tongue elevation, and munching/chewing, {{and unlike the}} suck-swallow-breathe sequence, coordination of these oral motor patterns is learned, not reflexive (Morris & Dunn Klein, 2000). When an infant is offered a spoon of puree, the practiced or familiar oral motor pattern is sucking. As purees are thicker than formula or breastmilk, puree is sucked off of a presented spoon and moved in the mouth {{in a similar fashion}} as liquid. This is generally looked at {{as a part of the}} process of introducing solid foods and parents are often encouraged to push past this. Conversely, current research supports that early negative experiences with eating leads to poor food acceptance in later years (Courtland, Harris, & Emmett,2009). Through playful exploration, BLW provides an opportunity for infants to practice new oral motor patterns. Through this method, infants gradually develop the oral motor patterns required for mature bolus manipulation, chewing, and swallowing, as well as allow the infant to be in charge of what goes in their mouth, how it goes in, and when.

30|$|The {{second phase}} {{occurred}} in the closing decades {{of the nineteenth century}} and into the twentieth century. In this phase, the primary factors that contributed to the secular reduction in mortality were revolutionary improvements in sanitation and developments in public health policy (e.g., filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, draining swamps, and pasteurizing milk). Public health did not fully come into its own until the acceptance of the germ theory of disease in the 1880 s and 1890 s, which led to a wave of new public health initiatives and the conveyance of safe health practices such as boiling <b>bottles</b> of milk, <b>protecting</b> food from insects, washing hands, and ventilating rooms, among others. The dramatic subsequent reduction in water- and food-borne diseases (typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and nonrespiratory tuberculosis) highlighted the role of public health (Cutler et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the effect of the {{presence}} of surfactants over time on free available chlorine (FAC), pH, viscosity, and surface tension of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) preparations. Methods Three preparations containing surfactant (Chlor-XTRA 6 % [Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI], Hypocelle 4 % Forte [Dentalife, Ringwood, Australia], and White King Lemon [Pental, Shepparton, Australia]) and 2 without, Vista 6 % (Vista Dental Products) and Hypocelle 4 % Forte plain (Dentalife), were tested. The solutions were stored in closed plastic <b>bottles</b> and <b>protected</b> from light at a constant 20 °C for 213 days. FAC was measured using iodometric titration, whereas pH, surface tension, and viscosity were measured using a pH meter, pendant drop method, and rheometer, respectively. The influence of the type of solution and the presence of surfactant over time on FAC was compared with the aid of linear regression models. Two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of passage of time and the type of solution on surface tension and the effect of the presence or absence of surfactant on the solutions. The Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons (post hoc) and to evaluate the effect of the presence of surfactant between solutions from the same manufacturer (α = 0. 05). Results Degradation of available chlorine was faster in the presence of surfactant when comparing solutions from the same manufacturer [Chlor-XTRA versus Vista (...|$|R
40|$|An amino-epoxy-silane based {{coating system}} (GAMAL) for glass {{surfaces}} was developed, which can efficiently <b>protect</b> <b>bottles</b> from the damages of a bottling plant. Testing bottles with a ramp pressure tester show an identical value of about (40 ± 4) bar for conventionally hot- and cold-end coated bottles and bottles coated with the developed organic-inorganic composite (GAMAL) system. After already 2 min of wet line-simulation testing, all species of a conventionally coated probe {{fall short of}} the critical limit of 16 bar, whereas bottles coated with GAMAL (thickness about 7 µm) show a value of (21 ± 3) bar. Coating is possible by dip and spray application on cold or hot (80 °C) substrates, the coating is cured at 120 °C for 5 to 10 min. Additional functions such as colour or UV protection can be added easily, without reduction of the protection potential. The low content of carbon (about 0. 5 g per 11 soft drink bottle) should not disturb the recycling process of such coated bottles...|$|R
50|$|One such {{element is}} the donor who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him. In The Golden Bird, the talking fox tests the hero by warning him against {{entering}} an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find {{the object of}} his quest; in The Boy Who Drew Cats, the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in Cinderella, the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in Bawang Putih Bawang Merah and The Wonderful Birch; in The Fox Sister, a Buddhist monk gives the brothers magical <b>bottles</b> to <b>protect</b> against the fox spirit. The roles can be more complicated. In The Red Ettin, the role is split into the motherwho offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessingand when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in Mr Simigdáli, the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor. In Kallo and the Goblins, the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in Schippeitaro, the evil cats betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was, do not feature the donor.|$|R
30|$|Prospective interventional {{study of}} 52 {{consecutive}} dacryocystorhinostomy, performed in 50 patients {{over a period}} of 1 year from 2013 to 2014. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Blood (10 ml) was drawn under strict aseptic conditions from antecubital fossa through a venipuncture. This was uniformly performed during two time points: fashioning of the nasal mucosal and during creation of lacrimal sac flaps. The top of the culture <b>bottle,</b> which is <b>protected</b> by a sterile cap is removed and the vials immediately inoculated with blood using a separate sterile needle. Following withdrawal of blood, all patients received an intraoperative single dose of a cephalosporin antibiotic (Cefuroxime). All acute dacryocystitis cases were operated by an endoscopic approach under general anesthesia. All patients were intubated, and stents were removed at 6 weeks. Clean cases of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstructions (PANDO) without any sac discharge upon marsupialization (22 %, 11 / 50) were not prescribed routine post-operative prophylaxis, whereas the remaining were prescribed oral antibiotics for 5 days. Post-operative endoscopic assessments were performed at day 1 and weeks 1, 6, and 12.|$|R
