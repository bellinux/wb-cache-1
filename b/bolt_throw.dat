2500|$|The Lee–Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee–Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The bolt has a relatively short <b>bolt</b> <b>throw</b> and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favorable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most rifleman without loss of sight picture.|$|E

50|$|The 28 Nosler {{is based}} on the 26 Nosler which was {{released}} in 2014. The 28 Nosler shares the same overall cartridge length (3.340") as the 26 Nosler which allows it to be chambered in standard-length action. This feature helps weight-conscious sportsmen to lighten their load before venturing into the backcountry. The cases’ overall length also aid in quick follow-up shots, since the <b>bolt</b> <b>throw</b> is shorter than on a magnum action.|$|E
50|$|One legend, {{according}} to the Etruscans and Romans, was that the Terme di Saturnia were formed by lightning <b>bolts,</b> <b>thrown</b> by Jupiter. During a violent quarrel between the two mythological deities, the <b>bolts</b> <b>thrown</b> towards Saturn had missed, causing the formations.|$|R

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the TRG system is a cold-hammer forged {{receiver}} and barrel. Both provide maximum strength for minimum weight as well as excellent resistance to wear. The action has a hex style profile on top with a smaller closed ejection port. Actions with an ejection port {{make it more difficult}} to reach in with a finger to discreetly eject brass when desired, but it does allow for additional strength in the action. The [...] "resistance free" [...] bolt has three massive lugs and requires a 60-degree bolt rotation and a 98 mm <b>bolt</b> <b>throw</b> for the short and 118 mm <b>bolt</b> <b>throw</b> for the long bolt-action; these features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target. The bolt handle is the appropriate length and sports a large synthetic bulbous knob that provides a firm, positive grip. On top of the receiver a 17 mm integral dovetail rail with shape connection drillings for one or more recoil lugs provides for fixing mounting components to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights. Folding iron sights can be obtained for secondary or emergency use.|$|E
5000|$|A 5 {{lever lock}} is often {{required}} for home insurance and often {{recommended by the}} police for home security. There are various grades but the current British Standard (BS3621:2007) is usually required for insurance purposes. Valerie Olifent notes that [...] "The doors of many historic churches still carry an old wooden lock although often you find that a modern 5-lever mortice lock has been installed alongside it to meet insurance requirements." [...] BS3621:2007 requires a <b>bolt</b> <b>throw</b> of 20 mm rather than the 14 mm of the earlier British Standard.|$|E
50|$|The Accuracy International {{receiver}} {{is bolted}} with four screws and permanently bonded with epoxy {{material to the}} aluminium chassis, and was designed for ruggedness, simplicity and ease of operation. To this end, the heavy-walled, flat-bottomed, flat-sided receiver is a stressed part, machined in-house by AI from a solid piece of forged carbon steel. AW rifles are supplied in two action lengths—standard AW (short) and long SM (magnum). The six bolt lugs, arranged in two rows of three, engage a heat-treated steel locking ring insert pinned inside the front bridge of the action. The ring can be removed and replaced to refresh headspace control on older actions. The AW system cast steel bolt has a 0.75 in diameter combined with gas relief holes in a 0.785 in diameter bolt body and front action bridge allowing high-pressure gases a channel of escape {{in the event of}} a cartridge-case head failure. Against penetrating water or dirt the bolt has milled slots, which also prevent freezing or similar disturbances. Unlike conventional bolt-action rifles, the bolt handle is bent to the rear, which eases the repeating procedure for the operator and reduces the contour of the weapon. The action cocks on opening with a short, 60 degree <b>bolt</b> <b>throw</b> and has a non-rotating (fixed) external extractor and an internal ejector. Firing pin travel is 0.26 in to keep lock times to a minimum. Finally, an 11 mm integral dovetail rail located above the receiver is designed to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights. As an option, a MIL-STD-1913 rail (Picatinny rail) can be permanently pinned, bonded and bolted to the action, providing a standard interface for many optical systems.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the English word gun is {{considered}} to derive from the name given to a particular historical weapon. Domina Gunilda was the name given to a remarkably large ballista, a mechanical <b>bolt</b> <b>throwing</b> weapon of enormous size, mounted at Windsor Castle during the 14th century. This name in turn may have derived from the Old Norse woman's proper name Gunnhildr which combines two Norse words referring to battle. [...] In any case the term gonne or gunne was applied to early hand-held firearms by the late 14th or early 15th century.|$|R
60|$|The Elmore Bank {{had just}} {{put in a}} new safe and vault. Mr. Adams {{was very proud of}} it, and insisted on an {{inspection}} by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three solid steel <b>bolts</b> <b>thrown</b> simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.|$|R

50|$|Testing of the XT40 {{began on}} 4 June 1948, {{revealing}} some major vibration problems from the reduction gearbox due to mis-matched noise frequencies caused by poorly designed gear teeth. The de-coupling system, designed to disconnect a power {{section in the}} event of failure worked successfully. During a run in a test cell one power section developed a major oil leak and an attempt to shut it down failed because the engine carried on running on the leaking oil. After many attempts to shut it down the offending power section could only be shut down by destroying the compressor with buckets of nuts and <b>bolts</b> <b>thrown</b> down the intake, proving the de-coupling system.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of the breakout, Ben Hardy was manning the Number 2 Vickers machine gun when he was {{overwhelmed}} by Japanese prisoners and killed. Before he was killed, Hardy disabled the gun by removing the firing <b>bolt</b> and <b>throwing</b> it away, thus rendering the gun useless to the escaping Japanese.|$|R

500|$|A [...] iron crossbow-bolt {{probably}} {{designed to}} carry a fire cartridge {{was found in a}} 13th-14th-century castle in Vladimir, Eastern Russia.

The full limits of his magical skills are unknown.|$|R
6000|$|Oh! it was {{a glorious}} thing to see the fear-nothing, dare-anything fashion in which, when he saw how matters stood, Ben <b>Bolt</b> <b>threw</b> down his stick and bundle, drew his cutlass, and {{attacked}} the two bears at once, single-handed, crying [...] "Come on," [...] in a voice of thunder. And {{it was a}} satisfactory thing, to behold the way, in which he cut and slashed at their heads (the heads having been previously prepared for such treatment), and the agility he displayed in leaping over their backs and under their legs, and holding on by their tails, while they vainly endeavoured to catch him. The applause was frequent and prolonged, and the two Esquimaux prisoners rolled about their burly figures and laughed till the tears ran down their fat cheeks. But when Ben Bolt suddenly caught the two bears by their tails, tied them together in a double knot, and fled behind a hummock, which the Big Bear passed {{on one side and}} the little Bear on the other, and so, as a matter of course, stuck hard and fast, the laughter was excessive; and when the gallant British seaman again rushed forward, massacred the Big Bear with two terrific cuts, slew the Little Bear with one tremendous back-hander, and then sank down on one knee and pressed his hand to his brow as if he were exhausted, a cheer ran from stem to stern of the Dolphin, the like of which had not filled the hull of that good ship, since she was launched upon her ocean home! ...|$|R

5000|$|Flicka is {{captured}} during a roundup, and Rob asks Katy {{not to go}} near Flicka. Determined to prove she can run the ranch, Katy starts training Flicka at night. Flicka slowly warms to Katy and the two develop a close bond. Rob sells Flicka to the rodeo, leaving Katy devastated. Nell and Howard are furious at Rob about making the decision without including them. Howard stands up to his father and says {{that he does not}} want the ranch and Rob refuses to take Flicka back. Howard and Nell refuse to help Rob with the ranch, which he is now considering selling since Howard does not want it. Katy starts writing about Flicka to escape her pain. At the rodeo, Howard and Katy enter the competition that Flicka is being used in, hoping to get the horse back. Flicka runs from Katy until the girl calls her name. Rob tries to intervene and Katy freezes at the sight of him. Howard boosts his sister onto Flicka and the two escape. Katy becomes lost in the mountains, and allows Flicka to make her way towards the ranch. The family reconciles and searches for Katy as a fierce thunderstorm moves in. Katy and Flicka are attacked by a mountain lion. Flicka <b>bolts,</b> <b>throwing</b> Katy to the ground and the lion goes to attack her. Flicka protects Katy, but is badly wounded. The girl binds Flicka's wounds, refuses to leave her and develops a fever. Rob finds the two and brings a delirious Katy back to the house. As her fever spikes, Katy calls for Flicka as Nell tends to her. Rob thinks Flicka is mortally wounded and believes she should be put down. Overhearing the argument, a dazed Katy stumbles into the room and gives her father permission to [...] "shoot us now." ...|$|R
60|$|What was that? In {{the silence}} {{he heard a}} gentle {{scratching}} sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from {{the door of the}} house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the <b>bolt</b> and <b>threw</b> the door open.|$|R
50|$|Polites was {{a member}} of Odysseus's crew. Odysseus refers to him as his dearest friend, though he is only {{mentioned}} twice, once as part of Eurylochus's scouting group on Circe's island (he {{is one of the first}} to enter Circe's palace) and then when, after a year, he convinces Odysseus to leave Circe. He is killed either by Scylla or the lightning <b>bolt</b> that Zeus <b>throws</b> at Odysseus' ship for his crew eating the cattle of Helios.|$|R
50|$|A {{stripper}} clip or charger is a speed-loader {{that holds}} several cartridges {{together in a}} single unit for easier loading of a firearm's magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function. It is called a 'stripper' clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the cartridges are pressed down, thereby 'stripping' them off the stripper clip and into the magazine. The clip is then either removed and tossed away, or the <b>bolt</b> is <b>thrown</b> forward, expending the clip without the need of prior removal. A few examples of designs that allow for stripper clip use include the Mauser C96, Lee-Enfield, Mosin-Nagant, SKS and the Vz. 58. Detachable magazines may also be loaded with stripper clips, provided they have a special guide attached, such as an M14 or an M16.|$|R
60|$|The poor negroes {{looked as}} if they had been all going to be killed, {{notwithstanding}} what their prince said to them, and stood staring to expect the issue, when on a sudden the gunner fired; and as he was a very good marksman, he shot the creature with two slugs, just in the head. As soon as the leopard felt herself struck, she reared up on her two hind-legs, <b>bolt</b> upright, and <b>throwing</b> her forepaws about in the air, fell backward, growling and struggling, and immediately died; the other two, frighted with the fire and the noise, fled, and were out of sight in an instant.|$|R
5000|$|Electric strikes can be {{differentiated}} in {{a number}} of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. [...] The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim Panic Exit Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the dead <b>bolt</b> is <b>thrown</b> and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the spring latching capability of the other lock sets). Mortise type locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.|$|R
50|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a secondary weapon called the Blade of Artemis: a large sword that offers alternative combat options. Kratos also learns to use four magical abilities, (such as Zeus' Fury: allowing lightning <b>bolts</b> to be <b>thrown</b> at distant targets) which allow the character to kill both individual and multiple targets. Other magical abilities include Medusa's Gaze, Poseidon's Rage, and Army of Hades. A relic called Poseidon's Trident is also acquired, allowing Kratos to breathe underwater and navigate through this environment. Early in the game, Kratos also acquires a special ability called Rage of the Gods, which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the second Chernobyl disaster, The Zone is {{littered}} with small areas of altered physics, known as anomalies. There are several different variations, each one having a unique impact upon those who cross its path. They can be potentially deadly to the player and other NPCs, delivering electric shocks, or pulling them into the air and crushing them. Most anomalies produce visible air or light distortions and their extent can be determined by <b>throwing</b> <b>bolts</b> (of which the player carries an infinite supply) to trigger them. Some stalkers also possess an anomaly detector, which emits warning beeps of a varying frequency depending on their proximity to an anomaly. The guide in the film Stalker, and his predecessors in the Strugatsky brothers' book Roadside Picnic, test various routes before proceeding. In the film, metal nuts tied with strips of cloth are used.|$|R
500|$|The light {{infantry}} cleared {{two additional}} hills as the column continued east—"The Bluff" [...] and [...] "Fiske Hill"— and took still more casualties from ambushes set by fresh militia companies joining the battle.

Now both principal leaders of the expedition were injured or unhorsed, and their men were tired, thirsty, and exhausting their ammunition. [...] A few surrendered or were captured; some now broke formation and ran forward toward Lexington. [...] In the words of one British officer, [...] "we began to run rather than retreat in order. ... We attempted to stop the men and form them two deep, but to no purpose, the confusion increased rather than lessened. ... the officers got to the front and presented their bayonets, and told the men if they advanced they should die. [...] Upon this, they began to form up under heavy fire." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tina Watson {{is buried}} in her native Pelham, Alabama. Her remains were exhumed and moved in 2007 to a {{different}} lot bought by her widower. After being informed by her family that flowers and gifts were repeatedly being vandalized or disappearing from the grave site, even when chained down, a police officer investigated. On hidden surveillance videos, he witnessed Watson removing them with <b>bolt</b> cutters and <b>throwing</b> them in trash cans. Watson later said he removed them because they were [...] "big, gaudy, plastic arrangements". Her grave was unmarked until 2009 when Watson provided a foot marker, prompting her father to request her body be returned for reburial. In 2011, the Probate Court removed Watson as administrator of Tina's estate, appointing her father who also wants her school and college pictures and yearbooks returned. Watson has appealed against the ruling and refused to provide the court with an inventory of Tina's possessions. Pending Watson's trial, the Circuit Court ordered him {{to stay away from}} the grave.|$|R
2500|$|Born on 16 May 1771 in Damvillers, France in what {{later became}} the {{department}} of Meuse, Loison briefly enlisted in a colonial battalion on 29 June 1787. However, he left the unit in September and when he returned on 25 January 1788, he was immediately granted leave. After {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution, his father served as a Deputy in the Constituent Assembly. He was appointed sous-lieutenant in the Meuse Volunteer Battalion on 15 September 1791 and became lieutenant in 1792. Several months later, he emerged as captain of hussars in the Légion du Nord. In May 1793, the Representative-on-mission of the Army of the North (France) promoted him to adjutant general (a rank equivalent to colonel) for bravery. This appointment was later confirmed. On 16 October 1793 at the Battle of Wattignies, he accompanied the 3,500-man column of Jacob Job Élie on the far right flank of the army. In the middle of the night, the outposts were attacked by the Austrians and the untried foot soldiers took to their heels. Élie managed to rally his men but Johann Andreas Benjowski's Austrians launched an assault in a heavy fog at dawn. The second line panicked and fired into the backs of the first line, whereupon the infantry <b>bolted</b> again, <b>throwing</b> away their muskets in order to run faster. They might have been butchered but for Loison who led the cavalry to the rescue and fought off the pursuit. French losses were 400 soldiers and 12 artillery pieces while the Austrians lost 138 men in the clash.|$|R
