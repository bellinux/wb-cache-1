5|$|In March 1944, {{planning}} for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a {{professor of physics at}} Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge selected the <b>bombing</b> <b>range</b> near Alamogordo Army Airfield as the site for the test. Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive magazine and a commissary.|$|E
5|$|Thornham Marsh, {{immediately}} west of Titchwell, {{was used}} between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a <b>bombing</b> <b>range.</b> Some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh {{is all that}} remains of a military hospital dating from that period. A First World War concrete building along the west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Wendover {{was used}} for {{training}} exercises, gunnery range and as a research facility. It was closed by the Air Force in 1969, and the base was given to Wendover City in 1977. Tooele County, Utah, assumed ownership of the airport and base buildings in 1998, and the County continues to operate the airfield as a public airport. A portion of the original <b>bombing</b> <b>range</b> is now the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) which is used extensively by the Air Force with live fire targets on the range.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1950s the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) {{participated in the}} {{majority}} of atmospheric nuclear tests, both in the Pacific and in Nevada. The group completed nuclear live drops at both the Nevada and Pacific test complexes and ballistic drops, or duplicates of the real thing, at the Edwards AFB Precision <b>Bomb</b> <b>Range,</b> the AEC Salton Sea Precision <b>Bomb</b> <b>Range</b> in southeastern California, and the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) <b>Bomb</b> <b>Range</b> near Edwards AFB. The 4925th Test Group (Atomic) also participated in drops at the Navy Auxiliary Air Station <b>Bomb</b> <b>Range,</b> California, Tonopah <b>Bomb</b> <b>Range,</b> Nevada, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico (Hardison 1990), and at KAFB’s Practice <b>Bomb</b> <b>Range</b> on IsletaPueblo, New Mexico.|$|R

5|$|Artillery {{may have}} been {{installed}} at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars, {{but there were no}} modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of World War I. Following the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a <b>bombing</b> <b>range.</b> A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period.|$|E
5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a <b>bombing</b> <b>range</b> near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably {{from that of}} a free–falling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Tube Alloys {{programme}} in Britain and Canada was {{the first}} nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs, {{and the fact that}} Britain was fighting a war within <b>bombing</b> <b>range</b> of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project. Despite reaching an agreement with the United States to share nuclear weapons technology, and to refrain from using it against each other, or against other countries without mutual consent, the United States failed to provide complete details {{of the results of the}} Manhattan Project to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union gained valuable information through its atomic spies, who had infiltrated both the British and American projects.|$|E

5|$|Transferred to the Strategic Air Command' Fifteenth Air Force in March 1947. With the {{establishment}} of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service later that year, the installation was renamed Wendover Air Force Base in 1947, but while bombardment groups deploying on maneuvers used the <b>bombing</b> <b>range,</b> the rest of the base remained unused. It was inactivated in 1948 and declared surplus, although retained in a caretaker status. The Air Materiel Command assumed responsibility for the base in July 1950, placing it under the jurisdiction of Ogden Air Material Area at Hill Air Force Base. Between 1950 and 1954, the base was manned by a skeleton crew of thirteen. The buildings deteriorated. Some were removed, some demolished, and some burned down.|$|E
5|$|Authorized to be {{built by}} Ansaldo of Genoa, the new battleship's keel was laid down on 14 May 1938 and {{launched}} on 15 November 1939. At her launching, she was christened Impero, after Italy's empire in Africa. With Genoa being in <b>bombing</b> <b>range</b> of France, and war now a definite possibility, Impero was moved to Brindisi on 8 June 1940 due to fears of French attack. Trieste was considered a better location, but Roma was fitting out there and the shipyard could not handle two battleships at one time. While at Brindisi, some of her machinery was installed, along with parts of her smaller caliber weaponry. Despite the intent to move Impero to a safer location, Brindisi was still hit by Allied bombers, though Impero was not damaged. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to shift production priorities to desperately needed escorts for merchant convoys. As a result, construction of Impero was delayed to expedite those ships. The only work done was the fitting of the engines and some gun mountings.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is unknown}} when it was opened, Loring was host to a Conventional Enhanced Release Training <b>bomb</b> <b>range,</b> which was located {{adjacent}} to the runway. Loring {{was one of four}} Strategic Air Command bases with a range of this type, and it was used frequently. The base was also located next to Condor 1 and Condor 2 airspace, which allowed for low-level training. The routes and training opportunities within the restricted airspace allowed training to be accomplished. One disadvantage of the location of Loring was its distance from the Strategic Training Route Complex and <b>bombing</b> <b>ranges</b> in Nevada and Utah. The ranges out west were the only location where the B-52s were allowed to drop live munitions, although SAC training only required crews to drop live munitions twice a year on these ranges.|$|R

That steel has been missing for over 35 years and is still unaccounted for by the US Navy, Environmental Protection Agency and US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Hundreds of steel drums of unknown origin were found among the wreckage. Their identity and contents have not been adequately verified.|$|E
25|$|No {{evidence}} of Pre-Columbian human {{settlement of the}} island has been uncovered. Christopher Columbus was the first European to visit the island during his second voyage to the New World; however, it was not named until 1517 by Spanish explorer Nuñez Alvarez de Aragón. During the 18th century the island was used by smugglers, pirates and bandits to hunt imported feral goats. During World War II, and until 1952, the island {{was used as a}} <b>bombing</b> <b>range</b> by the United States Armed Forces. From 1952 to 1964 the United States Air Force used Desecheo for survival training. In 1976 administration of the island was given to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and in 1983 it was designated as a National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 1996, three 509th B-2s dropped three inert GBU-36 weapons, {{the highly}} {{accurate}} Global Positioning System-Aided Munitions (GAM) which used the GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS). The B-2s made the drops at the Nellis AFB, Nevada, <b>bombing</b> <b>range.</b> Range officials, inspecting the area after the releases, were astonished {{to find that}} the GBU-36s had fallen seven, four, and four feet, respectively, from the target. A month later, the 509th repeated this impressive feat—only this time, they used live weapons. On 8 October 1996, three B-2s revisited the Nellis range and released 16 2,000lb. class GBU-36 bombs from an altitude of 40,000 feet. Again, amazed range personnel discovered all sixteen projectiles hit close enough to their targets to be confirmed as 16 kills. The results so impressed USAF Chief of Staff General Ronald Fogleman that he announced at a mid-December press conference the 509th and the B-2 would reach limited (conventional) operational capability on 1 January 1997.|$|E
