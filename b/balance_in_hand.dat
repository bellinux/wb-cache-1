50|$|The system {{operated}} was defective. The auditors did not audit {{the actual}} expenditure of the departments administering {{the army and}} navy. Nor was there any mechanism for ensuring that accounts were presented and passed promptly. Indeed the system actually encouraged abuses. The officers accounting frequently had {{large sums of money}} in hand, which they were able to invest until it needed to be spent. Thus a person no longer in office, but with a <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> had no incentive to pay it back in to the Exchequer. Furthermore, an ancient Statute (51 Henry III, c.5) required that accounts should be cleared in order. This meant that work on auditing a later officer's account could not even begin until that of his predecessor had received its acquittance (Quietus).|$|E

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 51). BRAC Bank Limited {{is one of the}} latest generations of scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh. It was founded in Bangladesh under the Banking Companies Act, 1991 and incorporated as private limited company on 20 May 1999 under the Companies Act, 1994. BRAC Bank Limited started its Journey on the 4 th of July 2001 with a vision to be the absolute market leader through providing the entire range of banking services suitable to the needs of modern and dynamic banking business as well as to promote broad based participation in the Bangladesh economy through the provision of high quality banking services. BRAC Bank Limited, with institutional share holdings by BRAC and International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been the fastest growing Bank in 2004 and 2005. BRAC Bank is extending full range of banking facilities as per the directives of Bangladesh Bank. It intends to set standards as the absolute market leader in Bangladesh by providing efficient, friendly and modern fully automated on-line service on a profitable basis. As a leading SME based bank BRAC Bank is to maintain large portfolio. It also follows & maintains Bangladesh Bank’s regulation and instruction to continue its daily operations. Treasury & FI Operations plays a vital role in this context. SLR stands for Statutory Liquidity Reserve, which is maintaining 19 % of bank’s Average Total Demand and Time Liability with Central Bank. It means of each 100 Taka deposit from customers we have to keep 19 Taka as SLR and we have to maintain it by mixing different portfolio instruments following Central bank directives. Of 19 % SLR requirement, 5. 5 % is CRR or Cash Reserve Ratio for daily requirement & 6 % average for fortnightly mandatory requirement. SLR can be maintained with Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, Foreign Currency Balance with Central Bank, Cash <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> Cash balance with Sonali Bank - agent of Central Bank and CRR is maintained with cash balance with Central Bank. SLR has direct correlation with Asset Liability Management (ALM) of Bank. ALM monitors, measures and manages the risks associated with balance sheet and guard the bank against any unforeseen loss or threat of survival. Now, the question should come how SLR & ALM has the linked up. It is nothing but the tools of Central Bank by fix the standard AD Ratio. AD ratio means advance to deposit ratio. It helps to judge bank’s liquidity position. In ideal scenario, AD ratio should be around 81 %, as 19 % of deposit is maintained as SLR. AD ratio might also go above 81 % considering bank’s capital, deposit base, contingency liquidity support window and overall depth of money market etc. At present, Standard AD Ratio is 85 % for Bank set by Central Bank. Treasury, to comply all the above regulatory factors, is performing their day to day task which is nothing but the goal of every organization - making money by minimizing risks. That’s why; they are called the heart of every bank like Bank is treated as the life-blood of the modern economy. Treasury is the bank’s fund manager and they are the prime profit center of every bank. The dimension of the department is they are dealing simultaneously in the Money Market, Capital Market, Securities market as well as Foreign Exchange Market. And, most importantly, the Head of Treasury of every bank is the Chairman of ALCO (Asset Liability Committee). The focus of the study is to analyze the Portfolio Mix of SLR (Statutory Liquidity Requirement) of Treasury & FI Operations of BRAC Bank Limited. Md. Abdur RahimM. Business Administratio...|$|E

60|$|This is the {{extended}} {{version of the}} provision which has been discussed already {{in the case of}} the colonies and of Alsace-Lorraine. The value of the property so expropriated will be applied, in the first instance, to the satisfaction of private debts due from Germany to the nationals of the Allied Government within whose jurisdiction the liquidation takes place, and, second, to the satisfaction of claims arising out of the acts of Germany's former allies. Any balance, if the liquidating Government elects to retain it, must be credited in the Reparation account.[22] It is, however, a point of considerable importance that the liquidating Government is not compelled to transfer the balance to the Reparation Commission, but can, if it so decides, return the proceeds direct to Germany. For this will enable the United States, if they so wish, to utilize the very large <b>balances,</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of their enemy-property custodian, to pay for the provisioning of Germany, without regard to the views of the Reparation Commission.|$|R
50|$|Catacombs, {{although}} most notable as underground passageways and cemeteries, also house many decorations. There {{are thousands of}} decorations in the centuries-old catacombs of Rome, catacombs of Paris, and other known and unknown catacombs, some of which include inscriptions, paintings, statues, ornaments, and other items placed in the graves over the years. Most of these decorations were used to identify, immortalize and show respect to the dead. Decorations in the catacombs of Rome were primarily decorated with images and words exalting Christ or depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.Much of the sculpture work and art, other than engravings on the walls or tombs, has been preserved {{in places such as}} the Museum of St. John Lateran, Christian Museum of Berlin University, and the Vatican.Three representations of Christ as Orpheus charming animals with peaceful music have been found in the catacombs of Domatilla and St. Callista.

This wrapping was in many folds, which he undid, and at last he found a pair of shoon, such as kings wear, adorned with gold, and also the most beautiful sword that he had ever seen. The handle was of clear rock crystal, and through the crystal you could see gold, inlaid with pictures of a lion hunt done in different shades of gold and silver. The sheath was of leather, with patterns in gold nails, and the blade was of bronze, a beautiful pattern ran down the centre to the point, the blade was straight, and double edged, supple, sharp, and strong.

50|$|According to Edward Bishop Elliott's interpretation, {{through this}} third seal, the black horse is {{unleashed}} — aggravated distress and mourning. The <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> the rider's <b>hand</b> is {{not associated with}} a man's weighing out bits of bread in scanty measure for his family's eating but {{in association with the}} buying and selling of corn and other grains. The balance {{during the time of the}} apostle John's exile in Patmos was commonly a symbol of justice since it was used to weigh out the grains for a set price. The balance of justice held <b>in</b> the <b>hand</b> of the rider of the black horse signified the aggravation of the other previous evil, the bloodstained red of the Roman aspect into the darker blackness of distress.The black horse rider is instructed not to harm the oil and the wine which signifies that this scarcity should not fall upon the superfluities, such as oil and wine, which men can live without, but upon the necessities of life — bread.|$|R
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hand</b> than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|R
