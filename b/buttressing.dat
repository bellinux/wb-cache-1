St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in more stable walls that could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, <b>buttressing,</b> lintels and arching. At the same time there was increasing influence from English and continental European designs, known as Romanesque. The Romanesque style had its origins in Roman building techniques and early churches in the Byzantine Empire and Italy and was characterised by massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded barrel vault roofs. The introduction of this style to Scotland is associated with the ecclesiastical reforms that began in the reign of Máel Coluim III (r. 1058–93), bringing continental ideas of monasticism and church organisation to the country. The oldest Romanesque church in Scotland is probably the small chapel built for Máel Coluim's wife Margaret on Castle Rock, Edinburgh, with a vaulted semi-circular apse. In the twelfth century a number of new parish churches were built by lords on their land. They were often small aisless buildings with two or three connected cells, each of diminishing size, ending in a rounded apse. One of the best preserved is at Dalmeny in Lothian.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth {{to enable them to}} crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf possesses greater <b>buttressing</b> when compared to all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that the gray wolf is better adapted for cracking bone than other canids. In comparison to extant North American gray wolves, Beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with a significantly greater number of broken teeth. The frequencies of fracture in wolves ranged from a minimum of 2% found in the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) up to a maximum of 11% found in Beringian wolves. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row also differs, with Beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with the incisors and then cracked with the carnassials and molars. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when taking and consuming large prey.|$|E

5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century <b>buttressing</b> (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland, from the sixth century, {{led to the}} construction of basic masonry-built churches beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule. After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in corbelling, <b>buttressing,</b> lintels and arching. At the same time there was increasing influences from English and continental European designs, such as the Romanesque chevron pattern detailing on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral, and the thirteenth century East-end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery. In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. The early sixteenth century saw crown steeples built on churches with royal connections, symbolising imperial monarchy, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh.|$|E

40|$|The vault is {{the main}} element of a {{majority}} of historical buildings. Masonry vaults exert an inclined thrust which must be resisted by a substantial mass of masonry: the <b>buttress.</b> The <b>buttress</b> system assures the safety of the whole construction. Old Master Builders were well aware of that and the traditional structural rules addressed mainly the problem of <b>buttress</b> design. Nowadays, the architect or engineer assessing the structural safety of a historical construction needs to estimate the safety of the <b>buttress</b> system with accuracy. This has been considered a simple topic, however, to estimate the safety of even a simple <b>buttress</b> is not an easy matter. The <b>buttress</b> may fracture under certain conditions with a substantial loss of stability. Besides, the <b>buttress</b> may show a certain leaning, it may be separated from the wall, etc. On the other hand, <b>buttress</b> systems are complex structures, a combination of walls and counterforts, flying <b>buttresses,</b> etc., made of different masonry. The matter cannot be handled in an abstract way. In the first part, an outline of the development of <b>buttress</b> design since ca. 1700 would serve to present the main approaches and to provide the historical context. In the second part, {{the state of the art}} of modern masonry <b>buttress</b> analysis is summarised, and a detailed discussion of the estimation of safety is made...|$|R

25|$|The outward thrusts in {{the lower}} portion of a {{hemispherical}} masonry dome can be counteracted {{with the use of}} chains incorporated around the circumference or with external <b>buttressing,</b> although cracking along the meridians is natural.

25|$|The nave is braced {{on either}} side by lower aisles, {{separated}} from the main space by a row of piers or columns.

Above the roof of the aisle are the clerestory windows which light the nave.|$|E

25|$|The new {{building}} materials of the 19th {{century and a}} better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century has opened up new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and pre-stressed concrete have eliminated the need for external <b>buttressing</b> and enabled far thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes has not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums.|$|E
25|$|Oddly, Cassini {{seems to}} have {{abandoned}} this reasoning, which Rømer adopted and set about <b>buttressing</b> in an irrefutable manner, using a selected number of observations performed by Picard and himself between 1671 and 1677.

Unfortunately the paper bears the stamp of the reporter failing to understand Rømer's presentation, and as the reporter resorted to cryptic phrasings to hide his lack of understanding, he obfuscated Rømer's reasoning in the process. Unfortunately Rømer himself never published his results.|$|E
25|$|Around 1090, Conrad's grandson, Emperor Henry IV, {{conducted}} an ambitious reconstruction {{in order to}} enlarge the cathedral.

The nave was elevated by five metres and the flat wooden ceiling replaced with a groin vault of square bays, one of the outstanding achievements of Romanesque architecture. Each vault extends over two bays of the elevation. Every second pier was enlarged by adding a broad pilaster or dosseret, which formed a system of interior <b>buttressing.</b> Engaged shafts had appeared around 1030 in buildings along the Loire (St. Benoit-sur-Loire, Auxerre, Loches) from where the technique spread to Normandy and the Rhineland.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of Chartres Cathedral {{is the extent}} to which architectural structure has been adapted to meet the needs of stained glass. The use of a three-part elevation with external <b>buttressing</b> allowed for far larger windows than earlier designs, particularly at the clerestory level. Most cathedrals of the period had a mixture of windows containing plain or grisaille glass and windows containing dense stained glass panels, with the result that the brightness of the former tended to diminish the impact and legibility of the latter. At Chartres, nearly all of the 176 windows were filled with equally dense stained glass, creating a relatively dark but richly coloured interior in which the light filtering through the myriad narrative and symbolic windows was the main source of illumination.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} arch-based constructions, {{there is an}} outward thrust {{generated}} against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is, of course, to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel {{down the length of}} the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by <b>buttressing.</b> The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.|$|E
25|$|The <b>buttressing</b> of {{the walls}} would be tested in AD 256 when Shapur I besieged the city. True to the fears of the defenders, Shapur set his {{engineers}} to undermine what archaeologists called Tower 19, two towers north of the Palmyrene Gate. When the Romans {{became aware of the}} threat, they dug a countermine with the aim of meeting the Persian effort and attack them before they could finish their work. The Persians had already dug complex galleries along the wall by the time the Roman countermine reached them. They managed to fight off the Roman attack, and when the city defenders noticed the flight of soldiers from the countermine, it was quickly sealed. The wounded and stragglers were trapped inside, where they died. (It was the coins found with these Roman soldiers that dated the siege to AD 256.) The countermine was successful, for the Persians abandoned their operations at Tower 19.|$|E

25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall <b>buttressing.</b> The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable.

25|$|Pisa Cathedral, built between 1063 and 1118, {{includes}} a high elliptical dome at the crossing of its nave and transept. The marble dome {{was one of}} the first in Romanesque architecture and is considered the masterpiece of Romanesque domes. Rising 48meters above a rectangular bay, the shape of the dome was unique at the time. The rectangular bay's dimensions are 18 meters by 13.5 meters. Squinches were used at the corners to create an elongated octagon in a system similar to that of the contemporary Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan and corbelling was used to create an oval base for the dome. The tambour on which the dome rests dates to between 1090 and 1100, and it is likely that the dome itself was built at that time. There is evidence that the builders did not originally plan for the dome and decided on the novel shape to accommodate the rectangular crossing bay, which would have made an octagonal cloister vault very difficult. Additionally, the dome may have originally been covered by an octagonal lantern tower that was removed in the 1300s, exposing the dome, to reduce weight on foundations not designed to support it. This would have been done no later than 1383, when the Gothic loggetta on the exterior of the dome was added, along with the <b>buttressing</b> arches on which it rests.|$|E
25|$|As the 16th {{century had}} worn on, {{inflation}} in Spain (a result of state debt and, more importantly, {{the importation of}} silver and gold from the New World) triggered hardship for the peasantry. The average cost of goods quintupled in the 16th century in Spain, led by wool and grain. While reasonable {{when compared to the}} 20th century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called price revolution. Spain, which along with England was Europe's only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth. However, like in England, there began in Spain an inclosure movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities. The higher inflation, the burden of the Habsburgs' wars and the many customs duties dividing the country and restricting trade with the Americas, stifled the growth of industry that may have provided an alternative source of income in the towns. Another factor was the militaristic nature of the Castilian nobility, which had developed during the centuries of the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula. They preferred careers in the government bureaucracy, the military, or the church, shunning economic activities. This militarism also meant that Spain exhausted its wealth and manpower in near-continuous wars. Under Philip II, these wars {{had much to do with}} combating Protestantism, but in the 17th century it became clear that the world that had existed before 1517 could not be restored. Spain's wars during that century became increasingly more to do with preserving the hegemonic power of the Habsburg alliance in Europe; although it should be noted that the Habsburg alliance was successful in <b>buttressing</b> the Catholic Church against the rise of Protestantism.|$|E
