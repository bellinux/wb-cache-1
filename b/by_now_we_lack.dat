40|$|We {{review the}} nature of the {{oscillations}} of main-sequence and supergiant stars of spectral type B. Seismic tuning of the interior structure parameters of the β Cep stars has been achieved since three years. The results are based on frequencies derived from long-term monitoring and progress in this area is rapid. Oscillations in mid-B stars as well as Be stars are well established <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> but <b>we</b> <b>lack</b> good mode identification to achieve seismic modelling. We provide recent evidence of g-mode pulsations in supergiant B stars. The spherical wavenumbers of their modes are yet unidentified, preventing seismic probing of such evolved hot stars at present. Improving the situation for the three groups of g-mode oscillators requires multi-site long-term high-resolution spectroscopy in combination with either space photometry or ground-based multicolour photometry. The CoRoT programme and its ground-based programme will deliver such data in the very near future. Comment: Invited talk, Proc. SOHO 18 / GONG 2006 / HELAS I Conference: Beyond the spherical Sun.

40|$|As of today, {{string theory}} {{appears to be}} one of the most {{promising}} physical models unifying the fundamental interactions in nature, such as electromagnetic (gauge) interactions and the gravity. While the perturbative theory of strings appears to be well explored <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> still <b>lack</b> an adequate formulation of string-theoretic formalism in the non-perturbative, or strongly coupled regime. One of the approaches, allowing us to explore the non-perturbative dynamics of strings (as well as of other physical theories with gauge degrees of freedom) is the formalism of ghost cohomologies, studied in this thesis. This approach is based on the fact that virtually all the crucial information on non-perturbative physics of gauge theories,but not manifestly gauge-invariant. Typically, these operators belong to a very special sector of the Hilbert space of gauge theories, where the matter and the ghost degrees of freedom are mixed. These physical operators are defined as elements of ghost cohomologies, studied in this thesis. In this work, we explore the formalism of ghost cohomologies on the example of supersymmetric c = 1 model which is one of the simplist models of superstrings, with elegant and transparent structure of the spectrum of physical states (vertex operators). We show how the presence of the ghost cohomologies enlarges the spectrum of states and leads to new intriguing symmetries of the theory and points to possible nontrivial relations of two-dimensional supergravity to physical theories in higher dimensions. We also develop general prescription for constructing BRST -invariant and nontrivial vertex operators.
