5000|$|The {{case was}} the subject of much media comment and public {{controversy}} in the period. Colm Tóibín described the reports on the Gay Byrne Show as reminiscent of a Thomas Hardy novel.

5000|$|In 1982, {{during the}} Falklands War, the British Royal Navy sank an Argentine cruiser, the ARA General Belgrano. Three years later a civil servant ({{government}} employee) named Clive Ponting leaked two government documents concerning {{the sinking of}} the cruiser to a Member of Parliament (Tam Dalyell) and was subsequently charged with <b>breaching</b> <b>section</b> 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. The prosecution in the case demanded that the jury convict Ponting as he had clearly contravened the Act by leaking official information about {{the sinking of the}} Belgrano during the Falklands War. His main defence, that it was in the public interest that this information be made available, was rejected on the grounds that [...] "the public interest is what the government of the day says it is", but the jury nevertheless acquitted him, much to the consternation of the Government. He had argued that he had acted out of [...] "his duty to the interests of the state"; the judge had argued that civil servants owed their duty to the government.|$|E
50|$|The 73-year-old law {{became the}} subject of debate with the advent of instant social media. Meant to prevent {{influencing}} citizens of the West coast whose time zone is about four and a half hours behind the East coast, bloggers had the possibility of receiving a fine of $25,000 for prematurely releasing the election results before all polls close. Under the Canada Elections Act, Section 329 applies to all forms of transmission regardless of the medium. In earlier days the Act was only directed towards television and radio outlets. Though a large amount of violation was anticipated in the 2011 Federal Election, only one case was prosecuted with a minimal fine. While some Tweeters and bloggers believe this is a violation of their freedom of expression, Elections Canada noted that results could be sent between individuals without <b>breaching</b> <b>Section</b> 329, though it was illegal to broadcast them on social media such as a Facebook Wall. Information technology specialists from Sequentia Environics and the Social Media Group have stated that people {{would not be able to}} conform to the policy conscientiously, and that enforcing confidentiality with the likes of Facebook and Twitter is nearly impossible. Other professionals have even stated there is no use of a law that cannot be enforced effectively. The numerous links and components to all growing social media platforms would necessite detailed examination of acceptable and prohibited sharing of election data.|$|E

That settlement took the form of an [...] "agreed statement of facts" [...] jointly presented to the Federal Court by Vizard's and ASIC's lawyers, and Vizard agreeing the court should impose penalties for a breach of his duties as a director.
