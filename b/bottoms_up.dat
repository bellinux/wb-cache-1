Her other acting credits include <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Up,</b> National Lampoon's Pledge This! (2006), The Hottie and the Nottie (2008), Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008) and Sofia Coppola's film The Bling Ring (2013). In 2012, Hilton announced her DJ career and made her debut at the São Paulo Pop Music Festival. Although her performance was criticized, she {{became one of the}} highest-paid celebrity DJs, holding club residencies all over the world. That same year, she also {{returned to}} music, signing a record deal with Lil Wayne's and Birdman's label Cash Money Records.|$|E
500|$|After {{retrieving}} a spent golden bullet from a belly {{dancer in}} Beirut and tracking its manufacturer to Macau, Bond encounters Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a casino. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her Peninsula Hotel room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs {{him to the}} <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Up</b> Club. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next hit, Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's dwarf henchman Nick Nack steals the [...] "Solex agitator", {{a key component of}} a solar power station. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and Q in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the [...] in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Hilton {{was arrested}} and charged with driving under the {{influence}} of alcohol, with a blood alcohol content of 0.08%. Her arrest complicated the fifth season of The Simple Life. Hilton's driver's license was suspended in November 2006, and in January 2007 she pleaded no contest to a reckless driving charge. Her sentence was 36 months' probation and fines totaling about $1,500. Her straight-to-DVD film <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Up</b> was released in late 2006. It received negative reviews; Australia's Urban Cinefile said that Hilton, is the lead role, [...] "spends most of her screen time flicking her hair as she delivers lines like 'books are those things you read'". In December 2006 National Lampoon's Pledge This!, in which Hilton appeared and produced, premiered in a limited release before going directly to video. She missed its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, protesting the addition of several nude scenes: [...] "I was so angry I snubbed my own premiere." [...] In August 2008 Worldwide Entertainment Group sued Hilton in Miami District Court, alleging that she did not fulfill her contractual agreement to provide [...] "reasonable promotion and publicity" [...] for the film. She reportedly received $1million for her work.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of difficult employees poses {{a challenge to}} today's organizations. A phenomenon which is rarely touched upon {{is that of the}} difficult employee in a subordinate position who directs his or her workplace incivility towards the manager (in this paper referred to as the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee). Eight managers were interviewed to gather and present qualitative data on the perceptions by mangers of a difficult employee within the workplace, the direct psychological impacts on coworkers and managers and the indirect psychological impacts on innocent bystanders caused by the constant contact or indirect relationship with the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee, respectively, and the best practices to employ within an organization to handle the <b>Bottom</b> <b>up</b> Employee. The results of the interviews confirmed the existence of the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee and the devastating impacts he or she can have on the manager. The consensus from those managers who dealt firsthand with the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee was to dismiss rather than to retain the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Up</b> Employee.

2500|$|In May 2007, Cashis {{released}} the eight-track The County Hound EP {{in an attempt}} to have people [...] "fiend" [...] for his music, or garner interest in it. The album was released as a limited edition EP. September saw the release of 50 Cent's third album with the label, Curtis, which was involved in a well publicized competition with rapper Kanye West, who had his third album, Graduation set for release on the same day. In June 2008, Obie Trice departed from the label. A misunderstanding was made where it was believed he was attacking the label and Eminem on a single titled [...] "The Giant" [...] but they were quickly dismissed. In a statement, Paul Rosenberg stated [...] "Shady Records has agreed to allow Obie Trice to pursue his craft in a different forum free from the constraints of the current major label model [...] Eminem will continue to support and work with Obie on many levels of his career [...] He remains a close friend and member of the Shady family." [...] In a 2012 interview, Obie opened up on the topic, admitting having issues with Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine, which was Trice's fault, clarifying [...] "I was kind of reckless, not on time, certain things and [...] didn't want to further the project with me so we tried to work it out but it just didn’t come to a head so I had to do what I had to do," [...] before going on to note that his relationship with the label is great, and he continues to work with Eminem, notably on <b>Bottoms</b> <b>Up,</b> which was to be released originally on Shady Records.|$|E

On either side the deck, against the rail and <b>bottoms</b> <b>up,</b> were lashed {{a number of small}} boats.

60|$|The moor was {{draped in}} fog. It was a still, damp evening. Swirling clouds rose slowly up, and lifted {{at times and}} {{disclosed}} the peaty hollows, the high tors, the dusky heather. But Trevennack stumbled on, o'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, as chance might lead him, clambering ever toward his goal, now seen, now invisible--the great stack of wild rock that crowned the gray undulating moor to northward. Often he missed his way; often he floundered for awhile in deep ochreous <b>bottoms,</b> <b>up</b> to his knees in soft slush, but with some strange mad instinct he wandered on nevertheless, and slowly drew near the high point he was aiming at.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} four orthogonal dimensions {{along which}} information in engineering design organizations can be ordered, namely (i) {{the principle of}} ordering (top down vs. <b>bottom</b> <b>up),</b> (ii) the structure of ordering (aggregation-decomposition vs. generalization-specialization), (iii) the breadth of ordering (diversity vs. parsimony) and (iv) the perspective of ordering (horizontal vs. historical). Four aspects of the top down vs. <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> dimension are also identified, i. e. the strategy, style, focus and source of ordering. Four of our case studies of design organizations are used to illustrate the above and also to demonstrate the tension (either in conjunction or in cyclic sequence) and/or balance between the extremes of the above dimensions. A high level approach for identifying tensions and creating a balance between <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> generation and top down influence is proposed, and tools and techniques to support identification of tensions to support the balancing of the top down vs. <b>bottom</b> <b>up</b> ordering...|$|R
