The metabolic theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set {{of relationships between}} an organism’s <b>body</b> <b>size</b> and temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and {{this results in a}} variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.|$|E

40|$|Predictions {{of species}} {{responses}} {{to climate change}} often focus on distribution shifts, although responses can also include shifts in <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> and population demographics. Here, shifts in the distributional ranges (‘climate space’), <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> (as maximum theoretical <b>body</b> <b>sizes,</b> L∞) and growth rates (as rate at which L∞ is reached, K) were predicted for five fishes of the Cyprinidae family in a temperate region over eight climate change projections. Great Britain was the model area, and the model species were Rutilus rutilus, Leuciscus leuciscus, Squalius cephalus, Gobio gobio and Abramis brama. Ensemble models predicted that the species' climate spaces would shift in all modelled projections, with the most drastic changes occurring under high emissions; all range centroids shifted in a north-westerly direction. Predicted climate space expanded for R. rutilus and A. brama, contracted for S. cephalus, and for L. leuciscus and G. gobio, expanded under low-emission scenarios but contracted under high emissions, suggesting the presence of some climate-distribution thresholds. For R. rutilus, A. brama, S. cephalus and G. gobio, shifts in their climate space were coupled with predicted shifts to significantly smaller maximum <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> and/or faster growth rates, aligning strongly to aspects of temperature-body size theory. These predicted shifts in L∞ and K had considerable consequences for size-at-age per species, suggesting substantial alterations in population age structures and abundances. Thus, when predicting climate change outcomes for species, outputs that couple shifts in climate space with altered <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> and growth rates provide considerable insights into the population and community consequences, especially for species that cannot easily track their thermal niches...|$|R

5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on <b>body</b> <b>size.</b> The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the degree of overlap in the feeding niches of early developmental stages of roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), perch, Perca fluviatilis L., bleak, Alburnus alburnus (L.) and sunbleak, Leucaspius delineatus (Heckel). The hypotheses were that (i) larvae of different fish species of similar <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> feed on similar food, and that (ii) smaller fish compete with larger ones for similar prey. The results of the analysis was to answer the question of whether the diet overlap of juvenile fish stages decreases with ontogenetic development. The study was conducted for two years (2001 - 2002) in two shallow, polymictic, eutrophic lakes. The diets of early developmental stages of fish species of similar <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> differed. The few instances of diet overlap resulted from the abundance of food resources in the environment. However, fish of smaller <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> exploited the same food resources as did individuals of the same species that belonged to different cohorts...|$|R
5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger <b>body</b> <b>size,</b> and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white plumage in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.|$|E

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to <b>body</b> <b>size</b> among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large <b>body</b> <b>size</b> and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and <b>body</b> <b>size.</b> There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences <b>body</b> <b>size.</b> Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their <b>body</b> <b>size.</b> As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
40|$|The nematode/copepod {{ratio is}} {{critically}} examined {{with a view}} to adding some precision to its proposed use in pollution ecology. At two unpolluted intertidal sites, differing markedly in sediment grade, the metabolic requirements of copepods are shown to be equivalent to the requirements of that fraction of the nematode population which feeds in the same way. The partitioning of this total energy requirement among individuals depends on the distribution of individual metabolic <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> and the relative rates of metabolism. The distribution of <b>body</b> <b>sizes</b> is constrained by the sediment granulometry, which affects nematodes and copepods differently. These considerations enable precise predictions of the nematode/copepod ratios expected in unpolluted situations, against which observed ratios can be compared...|$|R
