5|$|In a Russification {{drive in}} the 1840s, Nicholas I {{prohibited}} use of the <b>Belarusian</b> language in public schools, campaigned against <b>Belarusian</b> publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a revolt, led by Kalinowski. After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of Cyrillic to <b>Belarusian</b> in 1864 and no documents in <b>Belarusian</b> were permitted by the Russian government until 1905.|$|E

5|$|Variations of this flag {{were used}} during the <b>Belarusian</b> People's Republic in 1918–1919. The white-red-white flag is still used by the Republic's government-in-exile. Lasting from 1919 until 1925, {{the flag of the}} BPR {{retained}} the white, red, white design, but with the addition of black stripes at {{the top and bottom of}} the red stripe. Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the <b>Belarusian</b> national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by political organizations like the <b>Belarusian</b> Peasants' and Workers' Union or the <b>Belarusian</b> Christian Democracy, and non-political organizations like the <b>Belarusian</b> Schools Society. The flag was also used by the <b>Belarusian</b> Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|E
50|$|Polish and Lithuanian {{minorities}} in Belarus are predominantly Latin-Rite Catholics, but over 1 million Latin-Rite Catholics are ethnic <b>Belarusians</b> (over 15% of ethnic <b>Belarusians</b> total). The Greek Catholics are mostly ethnic <b>Belarusians,</b> with some Ukrainians.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{cultural}} closeness of <b>Belarusians</b> to Russians and weakly expressed national identity, <b>Belarusians</b> {{are more than}} other ethnic minorities exposed to assimilation in Russia. Despite mass inflow of migrants from Belarus during last centuries, children of immigrants rarely identify themselves as <b>Belarusians.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s and 1990s {{the waves}} of <b>Belarusians</b> that emigrated to the United States were {{relatively}} small compared with previous waves. People have emigrated for political, economic, and family reasons. Most of these immigrants are of the Jewish-Belarusian descent. The 1980 U.S. census counted 7,328 <b>Belarusians</b> in the United States, but the 1990 census registered only 4,277 <b>Belarusians.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the <b>Belarusian</b> government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government <b>Belarusian</b> NGOs, and prohibited loans to the <b>Belarusian</b> government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, Polotsk {{resident}} Francysk Skaryna {{translated the}} Bible into <b>Belarusian.</b> It {{was published in}} Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of <b>Belarusian</b> literature {{began in the late}} 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many <b>Belarusian</b> writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk.|$|E
5|$|Despite being replaced, {{the former}} flag of Belarus {{is used by}} those who oppose current <b>Belarusian</b> President Alexander Lukashenko.

50|$|According to statistics, from 1869 to 1910 {{the number}} of <b>Belarusians</b> in St. Petersburg grew 23 times and reached 70,000. By {{the end of that}} period <b>Belarusians</b> were the biggest ethnic {{minority}} in the city.

50|$|Many <b>Belarusians</b> {{were forced}} out of their {{homeland}} in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries. The earliest <b>Belarusians</b> immigrated in the seventeenth century to Netherlands and America under pressure of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Counter-Reformation in Belarus. <b>Belarusians</b> migrated to Siberia and the Far East after their lands were occupied in the eighteenth century by the Russian empire. Throughout the nineteenth century this continued.|$|R
5|$|In 1941 {{the flag}} was allowed for usage by the Nazi {{occupation}} administration, {{and it appeared}} on arm patches of <b>Belarusian</b> volunteers in the German Army and Waffen SS and {{was used by the}} <b>Belarusian</b> Central Rada, the pro-German government of Belarus in 1943–1944. After the end of World War II the flag was used by <b>Belarusian</b> diaspora in the West and by small groups of anti-Soviet resistance in Belarus itself. In late 1980s the flag was again used as a symbol of national revival and democratic changes in Belarus. By proposal of the <b>Belarusian</b> Popular Front the flag became state symbol of Belarus upon its regaining of independence in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988, the {{archaeologist}} {{and leader}} of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937–41 at Kurapaty, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the <b>Belarusian</b> people, causing <b>Belarusian</b> nationalists to seek independence.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 75% of <b>Belarusian</b> {{goods are}} exported, {{about half of}} which go to other member states.

5|$|Section Four, {{which is}} divided into four chapters, {{outlines}} {{the functions of the}} <b>Belarusian</b> Government, mainly the President of the Republic of Belarus, the Council of Ministers, the Parliament of Belarus and the courts. Although elected by the <b>Belarusian</b> people, the president must not be a member of a political party when he or she assumes office.

40|$|Alcohol {{use is a}} {{major public}} health problem. The problem of alcohol use might defer among the natives and foreigners in a given {{cultural}} milieu. Aim: To screen for theprevalenceofalcoholuse and related problems among the native <b>Belarusians</b> and foreigners in the general students population in Belarus. Materials and methods A total of 1517 respondents (172 foreigners and 1345 native <b>Belarusians)</b> from all major cities in Belarus enrolled for the survey. Standardized AUDIT, CAGE and MAST questionnaire including other alcohol-related questions were used as a measure. All three questionnaires were administered since {{it has been suggested}} that the CAGE might show less sensitivity, compared to theresultsoftheMASTandAUDITinsomepopulation [1, 2]. The Student’s t and Pearson, c 2 testswere employed for analysis of results. Results Overall, 90 % native <b>Belarusians</b> and 62 % foreigners were alcohol users. Problem drinkers were 16 % native <b>Belarusians</b> and 30 % foreigners. A significant increase (in approximately 2 times) in the rate of alcohol use after a 2 - 4 years stay in Belarus was noted among the foreigners (p < 0. 05). Conclusions There is a significant difference in the pattern of alcohol use among the foreigners and native <b>Belarusians.</b> The rate of alcohol use and related problems is higher among foreigners, compared to the native <b>Belarusians...</b>|$|R
