In both results, the formulation of UO is as given by Shah and Sinha [Unpublished manuscript (2002) ]. Further, we introduce a functional of practical interest, involving both direct and residual effects, and establish (c) optimality of Patterson’s designs with respect to this functional when the class of competing designs is as in (b) above...|$|E
40|$|Falling film steam-heated {{evaporators}} {{are used}} in the food industry but their thermal characteristics are not well known. Absorption-driven falling film evaporators represent a new concept in evaporation. In these evaporators CaCl(, 2), LiCl or LiBr brine flows down the outside surface of falling film evaporator tubes while the liquid food flows down the inside surface of the same tubes. If the brine concentration is such that its boiling point is higher than the boiling point of the food there will be a temperature difference between the brine and the food which will induce heat transfer and evaporation of water from the food. The vapor generated from the evaporation of the water is transferred through a vapor return line and absorbed by the brine. ^ In this work a long tube falling film evaporator was built and operated as a steam-heated evaporator and as an absorption-driven evaporator. The thermal characteristics of both types were studied. It was found that: (a) in both modes of operation the overall heat transfer coefficient, U(,o), is a weak function of the food side Reynolds number, Re(,f), for 1000 3 ̆c Re(,f) 3 ̆c 4000. (<b>b)</b> <b>U(,o)</b> decreases drastically when the temperature difference between the heating medium and the evaporating medium increases. (c) U(,o) increases with brine Reynolds number, Re(,b), for Re(,b) 3 ̆c 600, but it does not change for 600 3 ̆c Re(,b) 3 ̆c 1300 and (d) U(,o) does not change with evaporation temperature in absorption-driven evaporation but it decreases as evaporation temperature increases in steam-heated evaporation. ^ The brine temperature profile is affected by such factors as inlet brine temperature, Re(,b) and amount of non-condensables present in the system. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of Heavy Water Moderated Reactors is their high production of plutonium. This article demonstrates the possibility of reduction of plutonium and other actinides in Heavy Water Research Reactor. Among the many ways for reducing plutonium production in a heavy water reactor, in this research, changing the fuel from natural Uranium fuel to Thorium-Uranium mixed fuel was focused. The main fissile nucleus in Thorium-Uranium fuels is U- 233 which would be produced after neutron absorption by Th- 232, so the Thorium-Uranium fuels have some known advantages compared to the Uranium fuels. Due to this fact, four Thorium-Uranium fuels with different compositions ratios were chosen in our simulations; a) 10 % UO 2 - 90 % THO 2 (enriched= 20 %); <b>b)</b> 15 % <b>UO</b> 2 - 85 % THO 2 (enriched= 10 %); c) 30 % UO 2 - 70 % THO 2 (enriched= 5 %); d) 35 % UO 2 - 65 % THO 2 (enriched= 3. 7 %). The natural Uranium Oxide (UO 2) is considered as the reference fuel, in other words all of the calculated data are compared with the related data from Uranium fuel. Neutronic parameters were calculated and used as the comparison parameters. All calculations were performed by Monte Carol (MCNPX 2. 6) steady state reaction rate calculation linked to a deterministic depletion calculation (CINDER 90). The obtained computational data showed that Thorium-Uranium fuels with four different fissile compositions ratios can satisfy the safety and operating requirements for Heavy Water Research Reactor. Furthermore, Thorium-Uranium fuels {{have a very good}} proliferation resistance and consume less fissile material than uranium fuels at the same reactor operation time. Using mixed Thorium-Uranium fuels reduced the long-lived α emitter, high radiotoxic wastes and the radio toxicity level of spent fuel...|$|R
