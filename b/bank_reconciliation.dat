In this context, the reconciliations between banks were accentuated in the whole world, in particular in Tunisia (For example the merger by takeover of the BDET and the BNDT by the STB, which will constitute our practical case), since they realized that mergers constitute a useful means to face foreign competition, and thus to face globalization. However, the most important thing for banking mergers is to know whether they create an added value for the banks concerned with the merger operation and for their shareholders. In our practical work, we find that in the case of Tunisia, results are not consistent with the theory in the short and mid runs.
