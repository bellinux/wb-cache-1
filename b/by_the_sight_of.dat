5|$|These {{operations}} require {{from all}} of us – officers and men – exceptional efforts, sustained day and night, despite a moral tension tested to its limits <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the devastation wrought by a pitiless invader. However severe the trial may be, you will come through it gallantly.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to a {{courtyard}} known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E

5|$|Rita breaks her hip {{while she}} and Brian are having sex. Peter warns Brian that their {{relationship}} will not last much longer {{now that he}} must run errands for her. Brian goes out to pick up medicine for bedridden Rita, but is distracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> {{a group of young}} women entering a bar. One of them offers to have sex with Brian in the bathroom, after which he returns with her medicine. Realizing that he still loves Rita, he admits his infidelity. However, Rita decides he is far too young for her and breaks off their engagement. A regretful Brian understands that it is for the best and leaves her.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} left England on 30 September 1839, {{and after}} a voyage that was slowed by the many stops required to carry out work on magnetism, it reached Tasmania in August 1840. Following a three-month break imposed by the southern winter, they sailed south-east on 12 November 1840, and crossed the Antarctic Circle on 1 January 1841. On 11 January a long mountainous coastline that stretched to the south was sighted. Ross named the land Victoria Land, and the mountains the Admiralty Range. He followed the coast southwards and passed Weddell's Farthest South point of 74°15'S on 23 January. A few days later, as they moved further eastward to avoid shore ice, they were met <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> twin volcanoes (one of them active), which were named Mount Erebus and Mount Terror, in honour of the expedition's ships.|$|E
5|$|Great auks {{walked slowly}} and {{sometimes}} used their wings {{to help them}} traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Reportedly, this species had no innate fear of human beings, and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> something. They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds {{are believed to have}} had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.|$|E
50|$|Dix {{was profoundly}} {{affected}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, and later described a recurring nightmare {{in which he}} crawled through destroyed houses.

50|$|Tentacles {{are found}} {{emerging}} from pits and may retreat into these when damaged. This organism is first encountered {{as a group}} of three within a chamber for testing rocket engines. The impression {{is that there is a}} single organism with three tentacles which is later confirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> a squid-like body with three stumps when the player travels through the area below after defeating the tentacles. However, single tentacles are seen later in the game.|$|R
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

25|$|On March 9, 2005 (probably {{during the}} Martian night), the rover's solar panel {{efficiency}} jumped from around 60% {{of what it}} had originally been to 93%, followed on March 10, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> dust devils. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending {{the duration of the}} mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by either Spirit or Opportunity, easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously been photographed <b>by</b> only <b>the</b> Pathfinder probe.|$|R

Those that can remember are startled {{when they see a}} reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mishnah and Tosefta, in the Maccabean, Herodian, and Mishnaic periods, new {{months were}} {{determined}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> a new crescent, with two eyewitnesses required {{to testify to}} the Sanhedrin to having seen the new lunar crescent at sunset. The practice {{in the time of}} Gamaliel II (c. 100 CE) was for witnesses to select the appearance of the moon from a collection of drawings that depicted the crescent in a variety of orientations, only a few of which could be valid in any given month. These observations were compared against calculations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crossing}} of the Lima River is made throw the Eiffel bridge (1878) in the Coastal way, originally throw barges. The bridge {{and the town of}} Viana do Castelo are signed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monument-Temple of Santa Luzia (1904) over a hilltop. The Lantern tower of the sanctuary is where the pilgrim can see most of one's route {{in one of the most}} iconic views of Northern Portugal.

Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci, for example, was troubled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> birds in captivity, and (according to biographer Giorgio Vasari) once purchased caged birds in order to set them free. He also expressed anger within his notebooks {{with the fact that}} humans use their strength and power to raise animals for slaughter.|$|E
25|$|Jesus and Doubting Thomas; {{since these}} {{seem to have}} been sold at Jerusalem, not where the biblical episode was located in tradition, it seems these {{suggested}} a link between the experience of Thomas, who doubted until he saw and touched the physical evidence of Christ's wounds, and that of the pilgrim, whose faith was also reinforced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of,</b> and physical contact with, the scenes and relics of Christ's life.|$|E
25|$|A tie-in to the Day of Judgment {{crossover}} event, Anarky encounters The Haunted Tank {{and teams}} {{up with its}} crew to defeat an army of zombies rising from Arlington National Cemetery. Anarky also encounters various Founding Fathers in the process.

Upon eating the remains of the monster, the crew notices that the boiled blood of the creature cures their sick mate. Claude insists on bringing back some cocoons of the creature to Gothia, in order to establish a breeding colony to cure the citizens.|$|R
25|$|Credit for {{the concept}} of {{training}} Chinese in Western military tactics and arming them with the best available weaponry is sometimes given to Ward, other times to Li Hongzhang, a local Imperial commander “ordered to cooperate with — {{and keep an eye}} on — Ward's unruly contingent” and other times to Burgevine, who according to some began the training while Ward was recuperating, having been inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> a Chinese gun crew acting under French direction.|$|E
