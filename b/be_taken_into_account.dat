5|$|Former {{president}} Dmitry Medvedev of Russia {{stated that}} both {{the positive and negative}} experiences of the European Union will <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> and argued that the Eurasian Union will avoid the problems of economic gaps and disparity between countries, such as those found in the eurozone, since the member countries have a comparable level of economic development, as well as common history and values.|$|E
5|$|It must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> that Soviet T-26 was one {{the most}} modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E

5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> {{in the definition of}} a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E

5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account.</b> Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can {{increase the risk of}} decompression sickness because of the buildup of asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E

5|$|SR209 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account,</b> including {{the preservation of}} historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E
5|$|The Sm3 {{had a long}} {{prototype}} phase {{before the}} main series was ordered, with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time. Negative reporting continues to haunt the series' reputation. Reliability problems cannot be proven, as no statistics of specific train types are available. The train has not managed to cope with harsh Finnish weather conditions, and the time benefit of the tilting mechanism will not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> in timetables of winter 2011–2012. Nevertheless, the Sm3 has also received positive feedback from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the Finnish rail network.|$|E
5|$|In April, Pietraru {{met with}} the Provisional Government's Alexander Guchkov, and an {{agreement}} was reached regarding the maximum total of troops to be enlisted in the Romanian Corps. Answering to special pleas from Romanian Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu, Guchkov allowed for the recruitment of 30,000 prisoners in his custody. The order was revised by Alexander Kerensky, who reduced that number to 5,000 prisoners, noting that they were sorely needed as working hands in Russia's agriculture and industry. In practice, Quartermaster Ivan Pavlovich Romanovsky only allowed recruitment {{to take place in}} Moscow Military District, ordering that no more than 1,500 prisoners should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E

5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof {{needs to be able}} to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
