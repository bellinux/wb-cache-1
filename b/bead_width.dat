In the present research, {{which is based on}} a stress distribution analysis, the effects of a coined-bead geometry in the V-bending process on the increased compressive stress in the bending allowance zone and on the increased reversed bending zone in the leg of the workpiece were observed and characterized. The research also illustrated the variations in spring-back and spring-go characteristics for different coined-bead widths and heights.

Based on the stress distribution analysis, the increasing in draw <b>bead</b> <b>width</b> and the decreasing in draw bead height lead to the concave wall feature increased; however, the {{application of}} the too small draw <b>bead</b> <b>width</b> and the too large draw bead height generated the convex wall feature. The wall thinning also decreased as the draw <b>bead</b> <b>width</b> increased as well as the draw bead height decreased.

Typically <b>bead</b> probe <b>widths</b> are the width of the PCB traces with a length of about three times this.

This is especially useful in high speed input/output (HSIO) interconnects, where a standard test pad would interfere with the signal.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld <b>bead</b> grows in <b>width</b> while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld.

The methods most commonly employed to match the refractive indices have been to maximize the transmitted intensity through the bed or to rely on direct refractometer measurements of the indices of the two phases. Mismatch of refractive indices leads to error in estimation of particle position, PD, due to refraction at solid-liquid interfaces. Analytical ray tracing applied to a model of solid beads placed randomly along the optical path is used to estimate PD. The model, after validating against experimental results, is used to generate expression for PD as a function of refractive index mismatch for a range of <b>bead</b> diameters, bed <b>widths,</b> bed porosity, and optical magnification. The estimate of PD, which is found to be unbiased, is connected to errors in PIV measurement using the central limit theorem. Mismatch in refractive indices can also lead to reduction in particle density, Ns, detected light flux, J, and degrade the particle image. The model, verified through experiments, is used to predict the reduction in Ns and J, where it is found that particle defocusing caused by spherical beads in refractive index mismatched porous bed is the primary contributor to reductions of Ns and J. In addition, the magnitude of PD is determined for the use of fluorescent dye emission for particle detection due to wavelength dependent index of refraction. ...|$|R

In the proper range of welding current ratio, IT/IL= 0. 31 to 0. 5, the maximum welding speed achieved was 4 to 4. 5 m/min, which is 275 % higher at the maximum when compared with single wire pulsed GMA welding (at a maximum welding speed of 1. 2 m/min) ...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] of optical techniques such as PIV, PTV and LDA for velocity field estimation in porous media requires matching of refractive indices of the liquid phase to that of the solid matrix, including the channel walls. The methods most commonly employed to match the refractive indices have been to maximize the transmitted intensity through the bed or to rely on direct refractometer measurements of the indices of the two phases. Mismatch of refractive indices leads to error in estimation of particle position, Îµ[subscript PD], due to refraction at solid-liquid interfaces. Analytical ray tracing applied to a model of solid beads placed randomly along the optical path is used to estimate Îµ[subscript PD]. The model, after validating against experimental results, is used to generate expression for Îµ[subscript PD] as a function of refractive index mismatch for a range of <b>bead</b> diameters, bed <b>widths,</b> bed porosity, and optical magnification. The estimate of Îµ[subscript PD], which is found to be unbiased, is connected to errors in PIV measurement using the central limit theorem. Mismatch in refractive indices can also lead to reduction in particle density, N[subscript s], detected light flux, J, and degrade the particle image. The model, verified through experiments, is used to predict the reduction in N[subscript s] and J, where it is found that particle defocusing caused by spherical beads in refractive index mismatched porous bed is the primary contributor to reductions of N[subscript s] and J. In addition, the magnitude of Îµ[subscript PD] is determined for the use of fluorescent dye emission for particle detection due to wavelength dependent index of refraction...|$|R
