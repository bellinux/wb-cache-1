50|$|Flowers Island {{was most}} likely visited by {{fishermen}} and sealers in the late 18th or early 19th century. The first recorded baptisms on the island were Joseph Kean in 1816 and John Sturge in 1817 {{at the age of}} 23. Flowers Island appears in the 1836 Newfoundland Census with a population of 26, by the 1857 Census there were 66 people living there. The inhabitants relied on the small-boat, inshore cod fishery and a land <b>based</b> <b>seal</b> hunt. Flowers Island was eventually vacated with the decline of the local fishery, the rise of the Labrador cod fishery, the seal hunt, and technological changes. By 1911 there were only eight people living there;eventually they all resettled.|$|R

40|$|PS 212 is a plasma {{sprayed metal}} bonding chrome carbide coating with solid {{lubricant}} additives which has lubricating properties at temperatures {{up to about}} 900 deg C. The coating is diamond ground to achieve an acceptable tribological surface. But, as with many plasma spray coatings, PS 212 is not fully-dense. In this study, a chromium oxide <b>base</b> <b>seal</b> coating is used {{in an attempt to}} seal any porosity that is open {{to the surface of the}} PS 212 coating, and to study the effect of the sealant on the tribological properties of PS 212. The results indicate that the seal coating reduces friction and wear when it is applied and then diamond ground leaving a thin layer of seal coating which fills in the surface pits of the PS 212 coating...|$|R

40|$|A {{functional}} {{gradient material}} (FGM) <b>based</b> <b>sealing</b> {{was designed and}} applied to seal the α-Al 2 O 3 insulator with Na-β-Al 2 O 3 solid electrolyte of sodium anode batteries. FGMs with different component change rates were fabricated by powder stacking method. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} two dimensional feature of Na-β-Al 2 O 3 grains greatly influenced the density of the α-Al 2 O 3 /Na-β-Al 2 O 3 composite ceramics. It was demonstrated that the chemical diffusion of Na and Li in FGM diminished the interfaces among diffrent layers. Bending strengths of the FMGs reached (130 (2), (180 (3) and (225 (2) MPa for the samples with component change rate of 20 wt%, 10 wt% and 5 wt%, respectively. Moreover, the mechanical performance of the FGMs was rarely affected by heat treatment and thermal cycling, demonstrating its favorable mechanical and thermal stability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Diester based {{magnetic}} fluid {{is a novel}} intelligent material {{which use}} diester as carrier liquid and magnetic iron ore as magnetic nano-particles combined together with proper surfactant. Its specially unique characteristic contributes to wide applications in engineering research field such as magnetic fluid <b>based</b> <b>seals,</b> magnetic fluid <b>based</b> dampers and so on. This paper provides a method of diester-based magnetic fluid synthesis and analysis for the properties of prepared diester magnetic fluid as well as effective influencing parameters. The results show that for getting proper size and magnetization of magnetic particles, the proper reacted temperature is around 60 ~ 80 ℃, appropriate molar ratio of reacted solution is 1. 75 and concentration of forerunner is about 0. 6 mol/L. It is {{also found that the}} viscosity of diester-based magnetic fluid is decreased with environment temperature while the viscosity as well as saturation magnetization increases with the increment of density...|$|R
50|$|The lead pile {{section is}} fitted with an {{appropriate}} pile driving shoe. For friction piles {{this is a}} conical grout point and for end bearing piles it a standard driving shoe or end plug. In normal unobstructed soils a flat shoe is used to form an end plug. For soils that contain obstructions {{that are to be}} penetrated a steel end plug with a rock point may be considered. The piles can also be driven with an open end. When driven in this manner, approximately 1.5 m of the lead section will be filled with soil during driving.The end plug seals the pile against water and soil infiltration into the pile. With the <b>base</b> <b>sealed</b> the grout can be used to provide additional structural capacity and limits the corrosion exposure to the outside face of the pile.For friction grouted piles a patented conical grout shoe is fitted onto the lead section.|$|R
