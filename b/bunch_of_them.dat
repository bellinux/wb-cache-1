500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{graduation}} of Pat White, Brown {{was promoted to}} the starting position for the 2009 season. Against East Carolina, Brown led the Mountaineers to a 3520 victory and completed 24of 31pass attempts for 334yards and four touchdowns. For his performance, the Big East Conference named him the Offensive Player of the Week. The following week, West Virginia lost to Auburn, 4130. Brown completed 18of 32passes for 221yards and one touchdown, but also threw four interceptions and lost one fumble. After the game, head coach Bill Stewart defended Brown and said, [...] "He's learning, and we've got a lot of football to play. And I'm glad Jarrett Brown is my quarterback." [...] The Charleston Gazette wrote, [...] "Did he take some chances? Yes, and a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> paid off, which is why West Virginia led most of the game." [...] Against Colorado, West Virginia overcame a string of four consecutive fumbles in the first quarter, including one by Brown, to win 3524. Head coach Stewart credited Brown and running back Noel Devine with keeping the offense's composure.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian toured nationally during June and July 2012. The 20 date tour had {{concerts in}} all capital cities {{and also in}} {{regional}} areas of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Originally scheduled to promote the album after its release, the tour became a showcase for the new songs. An extra concert at the Palais Theatre, Victoria was added to film footage for the deluxe edition of the album. Sebastian performed songs from previous albums {{as well as new}} songs. He felt it was the best tour he had done, saying [...] "I pretty much put every cent back into the tour and really stepped up the production and the lighting, it's a lot bigger and better. I'm playing some 3000-seat venues and a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are sold out, so I want to make sure I'm not compromising. I didn't want to fall short, and it has come up great, better than I thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E

They are cut and brought home where the first task is to strip the bark from the trees. The strips are about hand wide and person long. The wood left over is named mokofute. The bark consists of two layers; the outer bark is scraped or split off from the inner bark. This work is called haalo. The outer bark is discarded; the inner bark, named tutu or loututu, is left over. It is dried in the sun before being soaked.|$|R

60|$|He {{was not one}} to morbidly analyze, {{not even}} to feel remorse. He put the past behind him easily. Before him small {{grasshoppers}} arose in clapping, buzzing clouds. Prairie dogs squeaked and frisked and dived needlessly into their dens. Hawks sailed like kites in the glorious, golden, hazy air, and on the firm sod the feet of his pony steadily drummed. Once a band of antelope crossed a swale, running in silence, jerkily, like a train of some singular automatons, moved by sudden, uneven impulses of power. The deep-worn buffalo trails seemed so fresh the boy's heart quickened with the thought that he might by chance come suddenly upon a stray <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> feeding in some deep swale.|$|E

From around {{one end of the}} house, which was a large one, Miss Amanda saw approaching an elderly gentleman who was small, with short gray hair and a round, ruddy face.
