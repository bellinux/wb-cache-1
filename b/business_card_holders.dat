A present research build a prototype of master model machine in spin casting technology which is not reliable for production process. The present master model machine was evaluated and redesigned focused on the need of larger mold frame and eliminate prop usage to enhance the reliability of producing good quality of master product souvenirs made from tin. The evaluation was started by constructing Functional Decomposition Diagram. Later, the decomposed part list was classified to its critical function based on Function Analysis. Failure Modes Effects Analysis (FMEA) was performed to evaluate failures of current machine. Those failures were become input for redesign process. Mechanical Design Procedure, Grid Analysis, and Tree Diagram were performed during redesign process. Some defects were found during experimental works of Adaro <b>business</b> <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> using the new master model machine.

5000|$|<b>Business</b> <b>cards</b> {{should be}} {{exchanged}} with care, {{at the very}} start of the meeting. Standing opposite each person, people exchanging cards offer them with both hands so that the other person can read it. [...] Cards {{are not to be}} tossed across the table or held out casually with one hand. Cards should be accepted with both hands and studied for a moment, then set carefully {{on the table in front}} of the receiver's seat or placed in one's <b>business</b> <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> with a smile. If needed, one may ask how to pronounce someone’s name at this juncture. When meeting a group of people, cards can be put in front of the receiver on the table for reference during the conversation or immediately placed in the receiver's <b>card</b> <b>holder.</b> <b>Cards</b> should never be put in one's pocket or wallet, nor should they be written on in the presence of the other person. This attention to <b>business</b> <b>card</b> etiquette is intended to show respect.|$|R

50|$|Afterwards, Betty tells Daniel {{that the}} only person she's seen that she could leave to look after him is Amanda. If he's serious about her going, this is goodbye. He gives her a silver <b>business</b> <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> and tells her that he's proud of her; she's destined for bigger things. She hugs him and tries not to cry. Before she leaves, she asks him if the other gifts she's been {{receiving}} were from him. They weren't. Daniel calls Sofia {{to tell her that}} he loves her and his heart doesn't race for anyone else. Betty walks out to her desk and looks at Henry. They exchange waves before someone walks by and kisses him but he pushes her away. Betty is crushed at the sight and rushes away to the elevator while he runs after her. The ring falls off Amanda's finger.|$|R

U.S. APEC <b>Business</b> Travel <b>Card</b> <b>holders</b> may also use the Global Entry kiosks at participating airports upon their U.S. return. But the U.S. APEC <b>Business</b> Travel <b>Card</b> can’t be used {{in lieu of a}} visa to enter an APEC member country. Other countries’ APEC cards can be used in lieu of visas. But the U.S. has decided not to participate in the visa reciprocity part of the program because the government is unwilling to waive visa interviews. Legislation authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to issue U.S. APEC <b>Business</b> Travel <b>Cards</b> only through Sept. 30, 2018, unless the law is amended to extend that date.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{restrictions}} on the benefits that members of APEC <b>Business</b> Travel <b>Card</b> <b>holders</b> can claim, which are covered under Decree 34/2008/ND-CP. It overruled existing immigration laws and exercised new temporary immigration control for foreigners working in Vietnam. However, the Government announced that the same rules would not apply to nationals of France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Phú Quốc Island. The Government exercised Decree 46/2011/NĐ-CP {{for the management of}} foreign employees in Vietnam, known as Managed Migration for all legal labor and student migration from outside South Asia. This area of immigration is managed and administrated by the Vietnam Ministry of Police. [...] Immigration applications are made at Vietnamese embassies or by consulates, and depend on the type of visa or permit required.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the {{majority}} of legal immigrants were males, but by the early 21st century, women accounted for nearly one-third of all legal immigrants. Over the last decade, many immigrants have been attracted to the urbanized areas of Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Danang, and the Central Highlands. Neighboring provinces such as Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu, Đồng Nai, and Bình Phước also witnessed an increase in immigration. The majority of immigrants moving to Vietnam {{in the last few}} years are much younger, with many between the ages of 15 and 34. Since the expansion of Decree No. 21/2001/ND-CP on 30 September 1992, the state has liberalized its visa policy with France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, Phú Quốc island, and APEC <b>Business</b> Travel <b>Card</b> <b>holders.</b> This policy change led to an increase in the number of immigrants from these countries.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, when its assets were {{at an all-time}} high of $25 billion, the firm had the sixth-largest {{consumer}} credit <b>card</b> <b>business</b> in the United States, with seven million credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> In 1999, the company sold this part of its business, including and related assets, focusing instead on the small business market.|$|R
5000|$|When a <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> buys {{something}} from a vendor and expects the card to be charged only once, a vendor may charge the card a small amount multiple times at infrequent intervals such as monthly or annually until the card expires. The vendor may state in the fine print that the customer is now a [...] "member" [...] and the membership will be renewed periodically unless the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> notifies the vendor in accordance with a cancellation procedure in the [...] "membership agreement" [...] which the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> agreed to when they made the initial purchase. Because the periodic charges are unexpected, infrequent, and small, most <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> will not notice the charges. If a <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> complains to the bank that the charges were unauthorized, the bank will notify the vendor of the disputed charges and the vendor will respond that the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> never cancelled the [...] "membership" [...] which the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> agreed to. Since most <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> {{have no idea what}} the cancellation procedure is and the vendor will reveal it only to new customers, the bank will not reverse the charges, but instead will offer to cancel the credit card and reissue it with a different account number or expiration date. Unexpected repeat billing is in a gray area of the law, depending on whether the customer legitimately agreed to the charges.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{warehouse}} the team {{finds out that}} the next <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> is in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lincoln, Sucre, Roland, and Sara proceed to Las Vegas. The foursome tails the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> in a casino to copy his card. Meanwhile, Sara becomes shaken when she learns from Lincoln that Michael may have a brain aneurysm and could die soon like his mother did. Roland's device fails to pick up any signal, and Lincoln deduces that the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> is keeping his card in his room. At an outdoor swimming pool, Sara is wearing a string bikini with a transparent dress over it and is sent to hit up the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> by faking {{that she was on}} a stagette party and her friends dared her to get a photo in a whale room. However, the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> refuses and leaves. The bartender tells her that she [...] "isn't his type" [...] and that the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> asked if he [...] "liked to party." [...] This leads to the team using Sucre instead, who accepts very reluctantly.|$|R
5000|$|Also, during Access Card creation, {{the game}} will ask the player to create a user name and password. This will be {{registered}} on the Internet and allows an Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> {{to gain access to}} the Project DIVA Arcade Diva.Net. Here, an Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> can edit data and perform many and more of the functions that a Project DIVA Arcade machine can do. However, an Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> must first accumulate 10 non-consecutive plays on any Project DIVA Arcade machine with an Internet connection before they can use many of Diva.Net's functions. Once 10 plays are accumulated, the Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> will gain 30-day access to all of Diva.Net's functions. Access to Diva.Net can only be performed this way, and one gains another 30 days of access every 10 plays. This [...] "access" [...] is known as a Diva.Net Right. Upon first play, a <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> can automatically obtain a Diva.Net Right once. Losing one's Right does not affect the data, but the <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> is unable to change it through Diva.Net until another Right is obtained.|$|R
40|$|A {{credit card}} {{is one of}} the {{facilities}} for facilitating buying and selling transaction which involves a bank or a company as the publisher, credit <b>card</b> <b>holders,</b> and sellers. In practice, however, the use of credit cards is determined by the good faith of the parties concerned in taking their responsibilities since it is not possible that there is a default in the contract conducted especially by the credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> The aim of the research was to explain the purchase agreement by using credit cards, the implementation of good faith principle by the credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> related to the purchase agreement, and the legal consequences of using credit cards when there is a default by the credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> The research used descriptive analytic method and judicial normative approach which described and analyzed the implementation of good faith principle of credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> related to purchase agreement...|$|R

5000|$|People {{who once}} had U.S. {{permanent}} residence status ("green card holders") may also face similar tax issues as accidental citizens, combined with similar unawareness of their status. Green <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> generally {{have the same}} U.S. tax filing obligations as U.S. citizens, regardless of their actual residence. Many green <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> later emigrated from the U.S. and let their green cards expire, believing that since {{they were no longer}} entitled under immigration law to live in the U.S., they also correspondingly had no further tax obligations. However, [...] provides that a green <b>card</b> <b>holder's</b> tax obligations do not end until a formal administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of U.S. residence; this generally requires the green <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> not just {{to move out of the}} United States, but to file Form I-407 with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. About eighteen thousand people per year file this form, but it is likely that many more green <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> moving out of the U.S. are unaware that this procedure is required.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} contribute to the advancement of knowledge within the services marketing and consumer behaviour domain. Its main aim is to enhance our understanding of the relationship between attitude and behaviour within a financial services setting. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) by Fishbein and Ajzen (1967, 1973, 1975) was employed as the theoretical basis of the research. Following an extensive literature review, we identified five constructs and credit card specific items. used to develop a Credit <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> Attitude-Behaviour (CABM) model. All the constructs (with the exception of credit <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> behaviour) were measured using multiple items. The survey method was employed via a self-administered postal questionnaire. The data collection instrument was submitted to a sample of 2000 randomly selected UK credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> Statistical properties of the constructs were analysed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. The proposed research model was tested with PLS in structural equation modeling technique. The results of the study provided limited support for the central hypothesis of a significant relationship between attitude and behaviour. Two unexpected findings included the significant relationship between <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> behaviour and experience outcome, and also substantial support for the relationship between attitude towards future real income and attitude towards credit <b>cards.</b> Credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> exhibit two typical behaviours and future research is needed to examine the attitude-behaviour relationship of convenience users (non-interest paying) and revolving (interest-paying) credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> separately. Also recommended, is the examination of the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> behaviour under observable variables as well as latent variables. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
