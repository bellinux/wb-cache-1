But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> {{think this is a}} better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E

His spirit is really good. He's got {{the eye of the}} tiger." [...] Rap-Up had reported that T.I. has been recording with fellow Grand Hustle artist B.o.B, one track was confirmed by B.o.B being titled [...] "Dream Me Up" [...] with production from Cut the Check. In an interview with Vibe, DJ Toomp revealed that T.I. was looking to get André 3000 as a feature on the album. MTV reported that T.I. confirmed collaborations from Lady Gaga, Kid Rock, Young Dro, Mac Boney and Eminem. T.I. told Rolling Stone about the content he had recorded, [...] "some songs talk about my time in prison — how I was affected by that, the way I've grown from that, things I see now that I may have not seen then, sometimes I talk about love, some songs I talk about life, some songs I talk about me being the shit on every level." [...] Kanye West recorded six songs for the album at Avex Honolulu Studios in Honolulu, Hawaii. T.I. told MTV's Jayson Rodriguez that the song [...] "Castle Walls" [...] (featuring Christina Aguilera) originally belonged to Diddy who had commissioned the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money.

2500|$|Stephen King {{liked the}} film, stating: [...] "Of Fox's two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening, partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's {{completely}} let himself go (hence the R rating), {{and partly because}} after Lady in the Water {{he had something to}} prove". Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie three stars, found it [...] "oddly touching": [...] "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "something different—and a pleasant surprise" [...] among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking [...] "the less-is-best approach." [...] The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film [...] "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense". Philipa Hawker of The Age gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on [...] "the mood of the film: a tantalizing, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," [...] drawing special attention to [...] "the sound of the breeze and the sight of it ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass— an image of tension that calls to mind Antonioni's Blowup". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip". Reviewer Rumsey Taylor said that the film moves forward with [...] "jack-in-the-box suspense, traipsing from one garish death to another in a parade of cartoonish terror," [...] and noted how the film seemed like [...] "Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, only without the birds." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The man she married. I {{was very}} much in love with her, and yet I didn't trust her. I was sure that she lied; I {{believed}} that she could be cruel.
