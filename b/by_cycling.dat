5|$|Shrewsbury has a {{comprehensive}} network of on-road and traffic-free cycle routes. In 2008 Shrewsbury was awarded Cycling Town status <b>by</b> <b>Cycling</b> England. As a result, Shrewsbury benefited from £1.8 million of grant {{funding from the}} Department for Transport between 2008 and 2011. The funding was used to make improvements to the cycle network in Shrewsbury, and to provide cycle training, information and advice to people to help encourage them to cycle to school and work.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemistry}} of the make-up water, including {{the amount of}} dissolved minerals, can vary widely. Make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies (lakes, rivers etc.) tend to be aggressive to metals (corrosive). Make-up waters from ground water supplies (such as wells) are usually higher in minerals, and tend to be scaling (deposit minerals). Increasing the amount of minerals present in the water <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> can make water less aggressive to piping; however, excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems.|$|E

Each DVD also includes two episodes from the series, from seasons 4 and 5 respectively, with licensed music removed. The latter disc uses a second-showing MTV version that was shortened by approximately seven minutes, {{rather than the}} original cablecast version. It does, however, include a short clip of a Daria appearance on Beavis and Butt-Head, accessed as a hidden Easter egg on the opening menu (<b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> among menu choices until the highlighting disappears).|$|E
25|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) lamps {{are used}} for both general and special-purpose lighting. Compared to fluorescent bulbs, their advantages are that they contain no mercury, they turn on instantly at any temperature, their extremely long lifetime is unaffected <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> on and off, they have no glass to break, and they don't emit UV rays that fade colored materials. LED lamps radiate almost no heat, and can be either multi-directional or unidirectional, {{eliminating the need for}} a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture. LED lamps can emit saturated colored light. Disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors, and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Pittsburgh {{dominated}} the second period, {{but did not}} score again in the frame. They also caught a break as Zetterberg's forehand shot from the slot hit the post and was then held by Fleury as it ricochet off his back. Kennedy gave the Penguins their second goal at 5:35 of the third after gaining the puck <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> behind Detroit's net with Max Talbot. Two Red Wing defenders went to Talbot, which gave Kennedy a clear lane to walk {{in front of the}} net and lift a shot high over Osgood. Kris Draper cut the Pittsburgh lead at 8:01, beating Marc-Andre Fleury on a wrist shot. The goal came after Jonathan Ericsson's slapshot was kicked aside and Draper was able to take the rebound and glide into scoring position. The Red Wings found their stride late in the game, but were thwarted on two late scoring chances. With 1:42 remaining, Dan Cleary raced into the Penguins zone on a breakaway, but his shot was turned aside by Fleury. In the final thirty seconds, an unlikely hero stepped up for the Penguins. After Fleury stopped Datsyuk's shot, the puck came to the goal mouth, where Johan Franzen was ready to pounce. However, with Fleury out of position, Pittsburgh defenceman Rob Scuderi stepped in front of the loose puck and blocked three Franzen shots with his skates to preserve a win.|$|E

These were the Côte de Wanne ( [...] at 7.4%), the Côte de Stockeu ( [...] at 12.5%) and the Côte de la Haute-Levée ( [...] at 5.6%). The Côte de Wanne was narrow and badly surfaced, with a {{dangerous}} descent following. The Côte de Stockeu was described <b>by</b> <b>Cycling</b> Weekly as a [...] "killer climb", because of its steep gradient, its narrowness and its poor road surface. The Côte de la Haute-Levée was unique on the course because it included a [...] section of cobblestones.|$|E

The Ring Command menu, which lets the player pause the game in combat to select different weapons, spells, and items, was not present in the original game, but was present in the sequels Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3. A version of the day-and-night system introduced in Seiken Densetsu 3 {{was added to the}} game, whereby some enemies are only present at different times of day, which changes whenever the player enters a new area.

500|$|The {{week before}} the race, Schumacher {{impressed}} Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at Silverstone. His manager Willi Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa track well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> around the track on a fold-up bike he had brought with him. He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh in this race. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and out-qualified 11-year veteran de Cesaris. Motorsport journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying [...] "clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof. Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems.|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 1999, the BBC {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} a Helen Rollason Award, to be given at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony in recognition of [...] "outstanding achievement in the face of adversity". Its first recipient was retired National Hunt trainer Jenny Pitman, who was herself diagnosed with cancer, and was presented with the award at that year's ceremony on 12 December. Other Helen Rollason Award recipients include yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur in 2001 for her courage in becoming the fastest woman to circumnavigate the globe, footballer Geoff Thomas in 2005 for raising in excess of £150,000 for the Leukaemia Research charity <b>by</b> <b>cycling,</b> following his own battle with the disease, and in 2014, the competitors of the inaugural Invictus Games, a multi-sport event for sick and injured service personnel, which made its debut that year.

500|$|Airlines have {{reported}} 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, {{at various points}} during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation {{has led to the}} tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told Aviation Week and Space Technology that CFM International had revised its FADEC software. The new software [...] "...'reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events' <b>by</b> <b>cycling</b> the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo unit) to clean the EHSV spool." [...] This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.|$|E
