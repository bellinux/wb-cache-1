The {{differences}} between the Electrochemical Mechanical Machining (ECMM) progress of Particle Reinforced Metal Matrix Composites (PRMMC) and normal metal are the behaviors of non-conductive Particles. This paper employed Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze the electrochemical reaction around the particle under different parameters. To seek applicable process, the electric filed analysis in the interelectrode gap of the ECMM process with the embedded tools has been adopted. Experiments about work voltage, electrode gap and the formula and concentration of electrolyte dissolution have been done. Through an ECMM hybrid process combined with a fast <b>back</b> <b>grinding</b> process, a surface about Ra 0. 5 um of PRMMC has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Back</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is the key}} working {{procedure}} in the silicon wafer manufacturing process. Ground silicon wafers ought to have low subsurface damage layer thickness (SSD) and surface roughness value. It requires that the wheel should have high self-sharpening ability and consistent performance. In this paper, the research on pore-forming agent {{in order to improve}} the wheel’s self-sharpening ability of the resin-bond diamond grinding was conducted. The research includes the pore-forming mechanism of various pore-forming agent, the influence of pore-forming agent’s type and the effect on the bond’s strength, the influence of pore-forming agent on the grinding performance of the wheel. Moreover, it examines the improved grinding wheel’s grinding effect by grinding tests...|$|R

Sean used to call Josh [...] "the feeb" [...] which was short for feeble, because Nelson was so skinny and often had broken limbs and injuries from skateboarding.

40|$|A {{chemical}} mechanical grinding (CMG) wheel {{was developed}} for planarization of silicon wafers, which consists of magnesium oxide (MgO) abrasives and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) additives, mixed with 25 % weight percentage of magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) solution. It was shown that chemical reactions occurred during the grinding process, which formed a softened layer {{on the top of}} silicon substrate. The reactants could be much more easily removed by mechanical abrasion than the removal of Si phase itself. The newly developed wheel was able to produce a similar surface integrity to that obtained from chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), i. e., the CMG achieved a surface roughness of 0. 5 nm in R (a) and a subsurface damage layer of 13 nm thick. The CMG process developed thus has great potential for <b>back</b> <b>grinding</b> or thinning of silicon wafers in order to replace CMP...|$|R

The cobalt silicide is used as the buried silicide layer in the SOMI substrate because of its high thermal stability, low resistivity and easier fabrication process. Conventional cobalt salicide process was used to form CoSi 2 structures. The SOMI substrate was fabricated on the wafer level using wafer bonding, CMP and <b>back</b> <b>grinding</b> technologies. A SOMI substrate, consisting of a 300 nm thick top-Si, a buried thin CoSi 2 layer, a buried SiO 2 layer on a silicon substrate, was formed using an SOI substrate as the starting material.

The impact of various mechanical bending and bending cycles show undeterred high performance of flexible siliconCMOSinverters. Future work will include transfer of diced silicon chips to destination site, interconnects, and packaging to obtain fully flexible electronic systems in CMOS compatible way...|$|R

40|$|Temporary {{wafer bonding}} for thin wafer {{processing}} {{is one of}} the key technologies of 3 D system integration. In this context we introduce the polyimide material HD 3007 which is suitable for temporary bonding of silicon wafers to carrier wafers by using a thermo compression process. Coating and bonding processes for 200 mm and 150 mm wafers with and without topography as well as two de-bonding concepts which are based on laser assisted and solvent assisted release processes are presented. Based on tests with temporary bonded 200 mm wafers, we found a very high compatibility of the bonded compound wafers with standard WLP process equipment and work flows suitable for backside processing of "via first" TSV wafers. Processes like silicon <b>back</b> <b>grinding</b> to a remaining thickness of 60 mu m, dry etching, wet etching, CMP, PVD, spin coating of resists and polymers, lithography, electro plating and polymer curing were evaluated and are described in detail. Even at high temperatures up to 300 C and vacuum levels up to 10 - 4 mbar, the temporary bond layer was stable and no delamination occurred. 60 mu m thin wafers could be processed and de-bonded without any problems using both release methods. De-bonding times of less than a couple minutes can be realized with laser assisted de-bonding and several minutes with a solvent based release. Compared to glues of other temporary handling systems, the proposed material offers the highest temperature budget for thin wafer backside processing as well as fast and easy de-bonding at room temperature...|$|R

40|$|Today 3 D {{interconnection}} {{approaches are}} considered to provide {{one of the most}} promising enabling technologies for More than Moore solutions. In particular, 3 D integration can provide significant progress in semiconductor device development regarding increased system functionality and integration density. In this paper, we describe an innovative concept for sensor integration based on a quality-proven open TSV technology on the basis of a 0. 35 m CMOS process. An application-optimized sensor-layer is processed on a specific wafer substrate, whereas the CMOS circuits of the system can remain cost-efficiently on an appropriate 0. 35 m CMOS or HV-CMOS technology. Another advantage of the proposed TSV solution is the geometric aspect. As the CMOS is attached to the sensor backside, almost 100 % of the chip area can be used for the sensing functionality. In the presented technological approach, the sensor wafer is finalized with processing a top metal layer and successive bond oxi de layers. The bond oxide layers are planarized by chemo mechanical polishing (CMP). The CMOS wafer is fabricated using a regular 0. 35 m CMOS technology up to the vias before the last metal layer. A nitride layer is deposited in order to protect the integrated circuits from damages during the <b>back</b> <b>grinding</b> process. Prior to bonding, the CMOS wafer is thinned down to a thickness of 250 m and then bonded to the sensor wafer by plasma activated bonding followed by an annealing step to reinforce the bond strength. TSV etching is sequentially performed in three steps: firstly, the oxide of inter-metal dielectrics is opened. Secondly, the bulk silicon of the CMOS wafer is etched using a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) process selectively stopping on the bond oxide of the sensor wafer. After several cleaning steps the spacer oxide is deposited followed by the spacer and bond oxide etching. For TSV metallisation, Tungsten as deposited in a CVD process is chosen providing uniform conformal coating inside the op...|$|R
