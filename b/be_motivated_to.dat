5|$|Most {{orthodox}} Christian theologians {{agree with}} the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and {{agree with the}} proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, {{would be capable of}} preventing it, and as morally perfect would <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> do so. The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2014, several journalists, {{commentators}} {{and financial}} sector insiders have again raised {{the prospect of}} further currency war. This time, rather than being intended {{as a means to}} boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> devalue their currencies as a means to counter the threat of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Kliegel et al. (2008), it was shown that motivational state {{affected}} performance in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, they will not <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> remember the intention. Less attention {{will be given to}} relevant cues and the memory {{is more likely to be}} forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.|$|E
25|$|While Acemoglu and Robinson {{attribute}} {{economic growth}} to institutions, {{there are other}} possible explanations, including geography, culture, and the ignorance of leaders. The alternative theories below are alternatives for the general framework posed by the book, rather than for {{either of the two}} theories above. Though these theories all try to claim a major factor that drives economic development, they are not mutually exclusive. For example, geography does shape the natural resources available to a country. For example, a country given rich resources has the potential to become rich. On the other side, institutions determine how those resources are distributed and create incentives for different groups to <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> participate in economic development.|$|E
25|$|According to this criticism, {{the electoral}} college reduces {{elections}} to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems within a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by voter suppression methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally disfranchising specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement {{has no effect on}} the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend {{the electoral college}} system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.|$|E

25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E
500|$|Kubah is {{an early}} example of {{literature}} dealing with the G30S and PKI, although earlier examples exist. Former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid described it as the first to deal with reconciliation between PKI members and general Indonesian society after G30S, an issue which was [...] "hyper-sensitive" [...] at the time. The historian Anna-Greta Nilsson Hoadley writes that Kubah explored why a person would <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> join the party, emphasizing poverty, cultural pressure, and active propaganda by the PKI. In the end, Karman is ultimately an [...] "innocent victim", who only joined the Party to improve his own standing. Even after his release Karman remains {{in a state of}} fear, [...] "marked by a prisoner's vulnerability." [...] The literary critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian wrote that, in this sense, Karman becomes representative of all PKI members who were arrested following G30S.|$|E

2500|$|AA {{tends to}} {{polarize}} observers into believers and non-believers, {{and discussion of}} AA often creates controversy rather than objective reflection. [...] Moreover, a randomized study of AA is difficult: AA members are not randomly selected from the population of chronic alcoholics; they are instead self-selected or mandated by courts to attend AA meetings. There are two opposing types of self-selection bias: (1) drinkers may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> stop drinking before they participate in AA; (2) AA may attract the more severe and difficult cases.|$|E

[...] "PIN" [...] stands for [...] "personal identification number", obviating the second word in [...] "PIN number"; in this case its retention may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word [...] "pin".

2500|$|If [...] "good" [...] coins have a {{face value}} {{below that of}} their {{metallic}} content, individuals may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> melt them down and sell the metal for its higher intrinsic value, even if such destruction is illegal. As an example, consider the 1965 United States half dollar coins, which contained 40% silver. In previous years, these coins were 90% silver. [...] With {{the release of the}} 1965 half dollar, which was legally required to be accepted at the same value as the earlier 90% halves, the older 90% silver coinage quickly disappeared from circulation, while the newer debased coins remained in use. As {{the value of the dollar}} (Federal Reserve notes) continued to decline, resulting in the value of the silver content exceeding the face value of the coins, many of the older half dollars were melted down. Beginning in 1971, the U.S. government gave up on including any silver in the half dollars, as even the metal value of the 40% silver coins began to exceed their face value.|$|E

2500|$|Imputed bias {{was also}} {{referred}} to in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), which involved {{the issue of whether}} the President exercises the power of clemency in his personal discretion or whether he is required to act upon the Cabinet's advice. The appellant argued that Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, {{who was a member of}} the Court of Appeal hearing the matter, ought to be automatically disqualified. According to the appellant, this was because the Chief Justice had previously been the Attorney-General, and as such, must have advised the President on the scope of his discretion. The implication of the appellant's submission was that the Chief Justice would have to decide the case against the appellant to cover up any negligence in his advice to the President. The Court endorsed the principle of judicial disqualification in the case of a personal interest, stating that [...] "where a judge is personally interested in the outcome of the case before him, he will not be able to give an impartial and objective judgment on the case. If he were to be allowed to adjudicate on the case notwithstanding this risk, that would, without more, undermine public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice." [...] It went on to reject the applicant's argument based on the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Locabail that a judge [...] "would be as wrong to yield to a tenuous or frivolous objection as he would to ignore an objection of substance". In the Court's view, the disqualification application was frivolous and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> diminish the judicial process such that a fresh hearing had to be convened. In addition, the central premise of the application– that the President could have acted in his own discretion in exercising the clemency power– was implausible.|$|E
2500|$|Fear of {{the unknown}} or irrational fear is caused by {{negative}} thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear like any other fears share common neural pathway that engages to mobilize bodily resources {{in the face of}} threat. Many people are scared of the [...] "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years, or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use False Evidence Appearing Real as a definition. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. E.g. Continuation of scholarly education, most educators perceive this as a risk that may cause them fear and stress and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research, this can lead to habits such as laziness and procrastination. The ambiguity of a situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety, other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly. E.g. War-ridden or Conflict places, Terrorism, Abuse ...etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate children's psyche development or personality. E.g. Parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment that it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing [...] a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.|$|E
