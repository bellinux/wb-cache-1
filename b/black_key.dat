2500|$|In June 1900, Weber {{was almost}} 21 and {{was living with}} her parents and two sisters at 1717 Fremont Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where she was a music student. By April 1903, Weber was {{performing}} as a soprano singer and pianist. She toured the United States as a concert pianist with renowned harpist Mrs Apt Thomas until her final performance in Charleston, South Carolina a year later. After an unfortunate incident when a piano key broke during a recital, Weber retired from the concert stage, having lost her nerve to play in public. Weber describes the incident that precipitated her retirement: [...] "Just as I started to play a <b>black</b> <b>key</b> came off in my hand. I kept forgetting that the key was not there, and reaching for it. The incident broke my nerve. I could not finish and I never appeared on the concert stage again. It is my belief that when that key came off in my hand, a certain phase of my development came to an end." ...|$|E

5000|$|Étude Op. 10, No. 5 {{is known}} as the <b>Black</b> <b>Key</b> Étude as its {{right-hand}} part is entirely on black keys, except for one note. Leichtentritt states that the melodic character resulting from the use of black keys is [...] "based on the pentatonic scale to which the piece owes its strangely playful, attractively primitive tint." [...] He presents a melodic reduction of the right hand part which, played in octaves by piccolo and flute, resembles a frolicsome Scottish jig.|$|E

50|$|The codebreaker {{tries to}} guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve (or ten, or eight) turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the {{decoding}} board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored or <b>black</b> <b>key</b> peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates {{the existence of a}} correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.|$|E
50|$|Like the SRT Hellcat, {{it comes}} with both red and <b>black</b> <b>key</b> fobs, with the black fob {{limiting}} the power output to 500 horsepower.

For interior features, it originally offers just one driver seat, though for $1.00 each, the passenger and rear seats can be added. Only 3,300 SRT Demons will be produced, with production beginning in the summer of 2017 and release in the fall of 2017, and is expected to be priced at less than US$100,000, as said by Tim Kuniskis.|$|E
5000|$|The archicembalo had two manuals, {{but unlike}} those {{on a normal}} {{harpsichord}} these two keyboards were used to provide extra pitches rather than a timbral difference. Both manuals contained all of the usual white and black keys, but in addition each <b>black</b> <b>key</b> was divided into two parts so that a distinction could be made between a sharp or flat note. The lower manual also included black keys between B and C, and between E and F. In total, 36 keys were available in any octave, each {{of which could be}} tuned to a different pitch.
