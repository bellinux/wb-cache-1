Navarro was reported to be in serious pain and had to be carted off the field. Later that day it was announced that Navarro suffered a bruised nerve. The Rays said that the injury was not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> it would cause Navarro to miss opening day.|$|E
25|$|Newland toured England in 1905 as {{a reserve}} wicket-keeper and {{understudy}} to Jim Kelly. While in the United Kingdom {{he played in}} 10 first-class matches with the Australian team, but could only score 67 runs at 9.57 and effect 13 dismissals. His disappointing performances may have been {{as a result of}} an eye injury he received during the trip over, which was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> he had to see an oculist in London. He had earlier, in 1904/05, toured New Zealand and played two matches against the national team. At that stage, New Zealand weren't a Test playing country so the matches had only first-class status.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of the Japanese forces was greatly weakened, as their naval supply lines had been cut and they had lost most of their existing supplies at Driniumor River. While the usual size of a Japanese Army division in wartime was 20,000 troops, {{at the start of}} May, 1945, this had been reduced to only around 1000. Takenaga's unit was no exception: while it was a battalion in name, in terms of numbers it was on the scale of a platoon, and at that one with only around half the usual number of infantry. The rest of the unit was made up of former mountain artillery from the 41st Division, whose squads were disbanded when all of their guns were destroyed at Driniumor River, and marines, among others. Takenaga himself was an artillery specialist, and had been moved to the 239th Infantry Regiment from his post as commander of the 3rd Battalion, 41st Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 18th Army had predicted that their food and medicine would run out by September, 1945, and that their weapons would become unusable {{by the end of the}} year. The situation was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> in July the 18th Army gave the order (18th Army Order No. 371) that the entirety of its forces should adhere to gyokusai, or honourable death without surrender, a move unprecedented even among the Imperial Army. One second lieutenant reflected that in the final stages of the campaign, the army had stopped being an army and had become a band of beggars.|$|E

On 14 October 1914, Kolberg and the minelaying cruiser [...] steamed into the North Sea to lay a minefield off the Firth of Forth, but upon realizing British forces were operating off the Dogger Bank, they broke off the operation and returned to port. Kolbergs first major action of World War I was the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 1516 December 1914. She {{was assigned to the}} II Scouting Group with three other light cruisers, tasked with screening for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group, commanded by Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper. While the battlecruisers were conducting the bombardments of the towns, Kolberg laid a field of 100 mines off the British coast. When the German forces withdrew, the weather became <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> Hipper ordered the other light cruisers to steam independently to the rendezvous with the main fleet; Kolberg had meanwhile joined up with the battlecruisers and proceeded with them.|$|E

In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane.

500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed critical response. In a review for Time magazine entitled [...] "Just Another Mississippi Whitewash", author Jack E.

He wrote, [...] "It is <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> most Americans know next to nothing about {{the true story of}} the civil rights movement. It would be even worse for them to embrace the fabrications in Mississippi Burning." [...] Columnist Desson Howe of The Washington Post believed that the film [...] "speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it". He felt the film was a [...] "Hollywood-movie triumph that blacks could have used more of during – and since – that era." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was [...] "sordid fantasy" [...] being [...] "trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges {{has little to do with}} history, sociology, or even common sense." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "...like the South African saga Cry Freedom, it views the black struggle from an all-white perspective. And there's something of the demon itself in that. It's the right story, but with the wrong heroes." [...] Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, praised the acting, but criticized the film's [...] "garish forms of violence" [...] and described it as [...] "morally repugnant".|$|E

He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} this {{negative}} publicity, New York's assembly in April passed a bill pardoning the New Hampshire grantees of offenses they may have committed, and recognizing, without requiring additional payment, the New Hampshire grants and those issued later by the Vermont Republic.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} two stages of the {{international}} financial turmoil, the Romanian banking system was not directly hit by its ripple effects. The aim {{of this paper is}} to gauge the potential impact of risks induced by the likely worsening of the domestic economic environment on the Romanian banking sector stability as a result of the third wave of the global financial crisis. The analysis is centered upon an econometric model which quantifies the rating downgrade probability in respect of credit institutions. The results derived from the model pinpoint that, in 2009, even though the majority of Romanian banking system’s assets is associated with a small rating downgrade probability, the expected dynamics of the weight of nonperforming banking assets slipped into positive territory towards the end of the period under review. Estimations for end- 2010 prepared under a multifactor hypothetic scenario of a hard landing of the Romanian economy in 2009 show that the credit institutions’ performance might turn <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> so <b>that</b> approximately 12 percent of banking system assets could be subject to rating downgrades...|$|R
