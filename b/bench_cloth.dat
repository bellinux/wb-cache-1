For {{the first time since}} 1959, Chevrolet offered an Impala that did not have or emulate the model's signature triple taillight feature.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the Mirada was offered {{in a variety of}} materials and colors. The base model dashboard was black with a faux woodgrain finish, which surrounded the gauges and center console, but the CMX came with a brushed aluminum finish replacing the woodgrain. The seat options were either vinyl bucket seats, leather bucket seats, or a 60/40 split <b>cloth</b> <b>bench</b> seat. Since the Mirada could be chosen with either a column shift or floor shift, the bench seat was only offered with the column shifter. Buyers had the choice of either an AM/FM stereo or an AM/FM/cassette stereo, an AM/FM/8-Track stereo, and a Chrysler CB radio could be chosen as well. The steering wheels offered were either an interior-matched two-spoke wheel with horn buttons in the spokes. The standard steering wheel for the CMX in 1980 and 1981 was the Mopar “Tuff Wheel”, which was similar to the sport wheel found on the vintage Mopar muscle cars such as the early 1970s Dodge Challenger. Manual windows were standard on the base model, but the power windows from the CMX could be ordered on the base models as well. A rare option was a Cabriolet mock-convertible roof, featuring a blocked-out quarter window.|$|R
5000|$|The 9C1 and 9C3 {{models were}} based on the LS model, yet offered steel wheels or steel wheels with wheel covers, {{optional}} rubber flooring, preparation for police equipment such as sirens, radios, and lighting, special badging, and inoperable rear door handles, windows, and door locks. It also came with the option for a rear vinyl bench seat and front <b>cloth</b> bucket or <b>bench</b> seats, both <b>cloth</b> front and rear seats, or vinyl front and rear seats. It also offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats. The foglamps seen on the LT, LTZ, & SS were optional in 2008 & stayed as an option until 2012 which did away with that option. The 9C1 & 9C3 also had the option of having the spoiler seen on the LT, & LTZ until being replaced by the spoiler that is on the SS & other models in 2009. The police sedans received the FlexFuel in 2008 feature to compete against the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, which also received a similar feature allowing it to utilize E85. Also updated were the 9C1 and 9C3 trim levels for the Police Package models, which did not have the civilian SS's [...] V8 engine, but used the 3.9 liter (237 cu in) V6. Police Sedans utilized the SS radiator and cooling system as an upgrade from the standard 3.9 liter engine (used in the Impala LTZ). GM did not wish to design a specific radiator and cooling system to equip a low-production V8 police vehicle. Also, the heavy-duty steel wheels were not redesigned, and as such, the Police Sedan used the original center caps or the older style wheel covers from the 8th generation model. The 9C1 and 9C3 were equipped with an external trunk lock tumbler starting in 2008. Neither feature was available for the civilian version of the car. The 9C1 and 9C3 police models had the standard wood grain for the 2006 model year until 2007 which was replaced by an aluminized interior trim. For the 2012 model year both the 9C1 & 9C3 have different end caps where the fog lamps are on the LT & LTZ trims on the front end bumper, received 17-inch wheels with new wheel covers, and the same LFX V6 that powers the civilian Impala. The pre-existing Caprice PPV will succeed the Impala 9C1 when it concludes production in 2016. Until then, the Caprice 9C1 and Impala 9C1 will be offered simultaneously.|$|R
