50|$|Plastic worm drives {{are often}} used on small <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> motors, to provide an output with a lower angular {{velocity}} (fewer revolutions per minute) {{than that of the}} motor, which operates best at a fairly high speed. This motor-worm-gear drive system is often used in toys and other small electrical devices.|$|R
5000|$|Electric Vehicle Prototype: Purolator is {{currently}} testing a <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> delivery vehicle, {{known as the}} “Quicksider.” The vehicle, which reduces up to 85 percent of greenhouse gases and smog-causing emissions, was tested on the city streets of Toronto. The Quicksider is planned for use in urban settings, where delivery vehicles make numerous stops throughout the day. The Quicksider was on display during the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|Plarail (Purarēru), {{pronounced}} in English as Play rail is a toy train and plastic track system made by Tomy and introduced in Japan in 1959. It was expanded into a <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> toy train system in October 1961. Plarail is not compatible with most other brands of model railway, although {{as it has}} a similar rail gauge to the wooden toy train systems, rolling stock may run on both systems to some degree.|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{analysis}} of <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> vehicles is presented. Attention {{is focused on}} assessing {{the influence of the}} battery on the mechanical and dynamical characteristics of dc electric motors with series and parallel excitation, as well as on evaluating the influence of the excitation mode and speed control system on the performance of the battery. The superiority of series excitation over parallel excitation with respect to vehicle performance is demonstrated. It is also shown that pulsed control of the electric motor, as compared to potentiometric control, provides a more effective use of the battery and decreases the cost of recharging...|$|R
50|$|Since {{at least}} the mid-1960s, <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> razors have been {{available}} using rechargeable batteries sealed inside the razor's case, previously nickel cadmium or, more recently, nickel metal hydride. Some modern shavers use Lithium-ion batteries that do not suffer from memory effect. Sealed battery shavers either have built-in or external charging devices. Some shavers may be designed to plug directly into a wall outlet with a swing-out or pop-up plug, or have a detachable AC cord. Other shavers have recharging base units that plug into an AC outlet and provide DC power at the base contacts (eliminating {{the need for the}} AC-to-DC converter to be inside the razor, reducing the risk of electric shock).|$|R
5000|$|In 1902 a {{newly formed}} New York and Jersey Tunnel Company was {{organized}} {{under the leadership}} of a Tennessean named William Gibbs McAdoo. The new effort, led by chief engineer Charles M. Jacobs, employed a different method of tunneling using tubular cast iron plating and a tunneling shield at the excavation workface. The large mechanically jacked shield was pushed through the silt {{at the bottom of the}} river. The excavated mud would be carted away to the surface using <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> locomotives. In some cases, the silt would be baked with kerosene torches to facilitate easier removal of the mud. The southernmost tunnel of the uptown pair, as well as the downtown tunnels, were all constructed using the tubular cast iron and tunneling shield method.|$|R
25|$|In January 2005, P {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} Gillette, forming the largest consumer goods company and placing Unilever into second place. This added brands such as Gillette razors, Duracell, Braun, and Oral-B to their stable. The acquisition {{was approved by the}} European Union and the Federal Trade Commission, with conditions to a spinoff of certain overlapping brands. P agreed to sell its SpinBrush <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> toothbrush business to Church & Dwight, and Gillette's Rembrandt toothpaste line to Johnson & Johnson. The deodorant brands Right Guard, Soft and Dri, and Dry Idea were sold to Dial Corporation. The companies officially merged on October 1, 2005. Liquid Paper and Gillette's stationery division, Paper Mate, were sold to Newell Rubbermaid. In 2008, P branched into the record business with its sponsorship of Tag Records, as an endorsement for TAG Body Spray.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{kerosene burner}} has a tank for fuel, a mantle, and a control dial. <b>Battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> ignition {{is a popular}} step up. The next rank has an electric fan to circulate hot air through the room. Many such units feature computer control of temperature. The computer can also turn them on and off on schedule. Gas heaters are popular, and many homes have gas outlets in rooms to accommodate portable units. Windows in many homes have vents to open to protect the occupants from excessive exhaust gas. Kerosene and gas units have safety features {{to turn off the}} fire and cut off the fuel supply when the heater receives a shake, whether from an accident or earthquake. These units usually shut off automatically after two or three hours to prevent carbon monoxide fumes from building up while the resident is sleeping.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, the Plarail system {{launched}} in Japan with three hand-powered trains. The first train set released was titled 'Plastic Railroad Set', which featured a plastic steam train and three freight wagons {{to be moved}} by hand, and a figure 8 of light blue plastic railway track. In October 1961, the range was expanded into a <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> toy train system, where the trains were fitted with miniature motors. The first set featuring this was the 'Electric Pla-Train Set', which included a three-car configuration of an engine and two wagons. The three-car configuration has been frequently used since, particularly for later releases based on real life passenger trains. In 1971, after previously releasing generic trains, the first Plarail model {{to be based on}} a real life train was released, the D51 Kisha. Since then, there have been hundreds of Plarail trains and rolling stock based on real Japanese trains. In 1972, the Plarail brand was becoming more known and production of track and scenery pieces greatly increased.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} {{generally}} consists of one large room. The {{main part of}} this room, the area where visitors are received, is defined by four central pillars; in this space {{there will be a}} figure of Buddha, a television, and a <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> light in the centre attached to the pillars. The parents’ sleeping space is situated either to the left or the right of the central entrance; textiles are often hung to separate this area {{from the rest of the}} room. To the back of the upper floor, on the left, is a space for the girls, whilst the boys have a space reserved for them on the right. This arrangement may vary from one family to another, but children are always separated by gender and placed at the back of the house. Other variations in position relative to the main central area are possible, but this room, with a figure of Buddha, television and battery-operated light, always remains the most important area.|$|R
50|$|Very small {{airplanes}} may {{be moved}} by human power alone. The airplane may be pushed or pulled by landing gear, wing struts, or even the propeller blades, since they're known to {{be strong enough to}} drag the airplane through the air. To allow for turns, a person may either pick up or push down on the tail to raise either the nose wheel or tail wheel off the ground, then rotate the airplane by hand. A less cumbersome method involves attaching a short tow bar to either the nose wheel or tail wheel, which provides a solid handhold and leverage to steer with, as well as eliminates the danger of handling the propeller. These tow bars are usually a lightweight aluminum alloy construction which allows them to be carried on board the airplane. Other small tow bars have a powered wheel to help move the airplane, with power sources as diverse as lawnmower engines or <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> drills. However, powered tow bars are usually too large and heavy to be practically carried on small airplanes.|$|R
40|$|The one- litter outdoor {{system of}} pork {{production}} may be improved with advanced technology. Artificial insemination and low cost gestation housing allow replacement gilts {{to be produced}} at a lower cost. <b>Electric</b> <b>fencers,</b> all terrain vehicles, and improved management all provide the hog producer an opportunity to raise more hogs at lower cost and with reduced labor.

40|$|Research {{conducted}} before 1991 on {{the effects}} ofstray voltage on dairy cows and investigativemethods are summarized in a U. S. Department ofAgriculture stray voltage handbook (USDA, 1991). At the time that this handbook was published, {{most of the research}} {{on the effects}} of electrical phenomena on dairy cows had been confined to continuous 60 Hz voltages and current. Recommendations for further research cited in this handbook include studies of the variability in sensitivity and response to current for a large number of dairy animals and evaluation of short-term and long-term exposure to transient voltage and current on animals. It has been known for some time that both cows and humans are less sensitive to short duration current pulses. Reports of experiments on human sensitivity to short duration current exposure can be found as early as 1901 (Weiss, 1901). <b>Electric</b> <b>fencers</b> and cow trainers, use a short-duration current to control animal behavior, hav...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} for {{the first}} time the application of portable micro-solid phase extraction (μ-SPE) for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this technique, a <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> whisk stirrer combined with a μ-SPE device was employed to provide agitation of the sample solution and facilitate the pre-concentration of the target analytes. The μ-SPE device consisted of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) packed in a polypropylene (PP) membrane. The performance of μ-SPE sampling coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was evaluated for the analysis of five target PAHs (fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene) in water. Important μ-SPE parameters were studied and the optimal extraction conditions were 30 min extraction time, 10 min desorption time, isopropanol as the conditioning and desorption solvent and no addition of a salt. The developed portable μ-SPE method provided good linearity in the concentration range of 0. 1 - 100 μg L- 1 for fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene, and 1 - 100 μg L- 1 for benzo[a]pyrene, with good coefficients of determination (r 2, 0. 9975 - 0. 9989), low limits of detection (0. 01 - 0. 59 μg L- 1), acceptable intra-day precisions (3. 5 - 6. 2 % for on-site analysis) and acceptable relative recoveries (77. 3 - 107. 2 %). Portable μ-SPE combined with HPLC-UV was successfully applied to the determination of target PAHs in selected water samples. The proposed sample preparation technique proved to be simple, cost effective, easy-to-operate and feasible for both off-site and on-site analyses...|$|R

40|$|The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is {{designed}} to bring about 1. 9 ML of Colorado River water per year to Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties in Arizona. CAP carries water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu toTucson. The CAP canal system is a 540 km long system of conveyance system aqueducts, tunnels, pumping plants,pipelines and a large reservoir (just north of Phoenix, AZ). Water is pumped uphill from the Colorado River. This study was conducted for the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which starts at the after bay of the Bouse Hill Pumping Plant and extends to the fore bay of the Salt-Gila Pumping Plant, which is {{just south of the}} Salt River, east of Phoenix. Additional pumping plants downstream lift water uphill to Tucson. The canal between adjacent pumping plants defines a canal segment. A sloping lined canal with check structures carries water between power plants. The canal between adjacent check structures defines a canal pool. The Pumping Plants use electric motors to power the pumps. Power outages could cause the canal to overtop at the fore bay of these power plants, since the flow in the canal would not stop with a power outage. The check structures in between the power plants can be closed with <b>battery-operated</b> <b>electric</b> motors. This was intended to contain water within each canal pool, if power is lost. Stopping the pumping plants and closing the check gates causes surge waves in the canal. Some additional freeboard at the downstream end of each canal pool was provided to contain these surge waves. Increases in frictional resistance in the canal have reduced the available canal freeboard from design conditions. This study evaluated the available freeboard in the canal during steady conditions and during unsteady conditions, associated with a power outage. HEC-RAS was used to determine water surface elevations and available freeboard under both steady and unsteady conditions...|$|R
