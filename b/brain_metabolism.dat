5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. <b>Brain</b> <b>metabolism</b> {{normally}} relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

40|$|New {{findings}} obtained {{during the}} past years, especially the discovery of mutations in the genes associated with <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism,</b> have provided key insights into the homeostatic mechanisms of <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism</b> and the pathological mechanisms responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that misregulation in <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism</b> {{is one of the}} initial causes for neuronal death in some neurodegenerative disorders. The errors in <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism</b> found in these disorders have a multifactorial pathogenesis, including genetic and nongenetic factors. The disturbances of iron metabolism might occur at multiple levels, including iron uptake and release, storage, intracellular metabolism and regulation.

40|$|Objective: In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of stimulator of Fe transport (SFT) on Fe metabolism and its abnormality (absence or overloading), this study reviews the research development of SFT at home and abroad and focused on the relationship among expression, structure, physiological function, expressing controlling and expressing abnormality with <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism.</b> Data sources: Electronic literature search of NCBI related to SFT was performed using the terms "stimulator of iron transport" or "stimulator of Fe transport", and the language was restricted in English. And simultaneously CNKI database was searched with the word "brain iron metabolism" and "stimulator of Fe transport" in Chinese from January 1997 to October 2004. Study selection: Articles that reported the structure, expression regulation of SFT and its relationship to <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism</b> diseases were included. Data extraction: Twenty pieces of SFT-related literatures and 1300 pieces of literatures related to <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism</b> were found, among which 21 pieces were included. Data synthesis: From the 21 pieces of literatures, the structure, distribution, biological function, expression regulation of SFT and its relationship with <b>brain</b> iron <b>metabolism</b> were mainly discussed. Conclusion: SFT can stimulate both transferrin- and nontransferrin-bound iron uptake. The expression of SFT can be regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, mainly regulated in response to different cellular iron levels.

25|$|Sleep {{studies using}} polysomnography have {{suggested}} {{that people who have}} sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of <b>brain</b> <b>metabolism</b> using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12-dependent MTR {{reactions}} {{may also}} have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate methionine (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, {{if it is not}} regenerated from homocysteine by a B12 dependent reaction) is needed to make S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of myelin sheath phospholipids. Although production of SAMe is not B12 dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the essential amino acid methionine) is assisted by B12. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain neurotransmitters, catecholamines and in <b>brain</b> <b>metabolism.</b> These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B12 deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.|$|E

40|$|Aging is {{associated}} with reductions in <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism</b> in some cortical and subcortical regions, but the rate of decrease varies significantly between individuals, likely reflecting genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Here we test {{the hypothesis that the}} variant of the dopamine receptor D 4 (DRD 4) gene (VNTR in exon 3), which has been associated with novelty seeking and sensitivity to environmental stimuli (negative and positive) including the beneficial effects of physical activity on longevity, influence the effects of aging on the human brain. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and [(18) F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18) FDG) to measure <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism</b> (marker of <b>brain</b> function) under baseline conditions (no stimulation) in 82 healthy individuals (age range 22 - 55 years). We determined their DRD 4 genotype and found an interaction with age: individuals who did not carry the 7 -repeat allele (7 R-, n =  53) had a significant (p< 0. 0001) negative association between age and relative glucose metabolism (normalized to whole <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism)</b> in frontal (r = - 0. 52), temporal (r = - 0. 51) and striatal regions (r = - 0. 47, p< 0. 001); such that older individuals had lower metabolism than younger ones. In contrast, for carriers of the 7 R allele (7 R+ n =  29), these correlations with age were not significant and they only showed a positive association with cerebellar glucose metabolism (r = + 0. 55; p =  0. 002). Regression slopes of regional <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism</b> with age differed significantly between the 7 R+ and 7 R- groups in cerebellum, inferior temporal cortex and striatum. These results provide evidence that the DRD 4 genotype might modulate the associations between regional <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism</b> and age and that the carriers of the 7 R allele appear to be less sensitive to the effects of age on <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism...</b>|$|R
2500|$|PET {{scanning}} is {{also used}} for diagnosis of brain disease, most notably because brain tumors, strokes, and neuron-damaging diseases which cause dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) all cause great changes in <b>brain</b> <b>metabolism,</b> which in turn causes easily detectable changes in PET scans. PET is probably most useful in early cases of certain dementias (with classic examples being Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease) where the early damage is too diffuse and makes too little difference in brain volume and gross structure to change CT and standard MRI images {{enough to be able}} to reliably differentiate it from the [...] "normal" [...] range of cortical atrophy which occurs with aging (in many but not all) persons, and which does not cause clinical dementia.|$|E
2500|$|This {{pathologic}} phenomenon {{can also}} occur after brain injury and spinal cord injury. Within minutes after spinal cord injury, damaged neural cells within the lesion site spill glutamate into the extracellular space where glutamate can stimulate presynaptic glutamate receptors {{to enhance the}} release of additional glutamate. Brain trauma or stroke can cause [...] ischemia, in which blood flow is reduced to inadequate levels. Ischemia is followed by accumulation of glutamate and aspartate in the extracellular fluid, causing cell death, which is aggravated by lack of oxygen and glucose. The biochemical cascade resulting from ischemia and involving excitotoxicity is called the ischemic cascade. [...] Because of the events resulting from ischemia and glutamate receptor activation, a deep chemical coma may be induced in patients with brain injury to reduce the metabolic rate of the brain (its need for oxygen and glucose) and save energy {{to be used to}} remove glutamate actively. (The main aim in induced comas is to reduce the intracranial pressure, not <b>brain</b> <b>metabolism).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Neurology: PET neuroimaging {{is based}} on an {{assumption}} that areas of high radioactivity are associated with brain activity. What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer oxygen-15. However, because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical cyclotron for such uses, which is difficult. In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease greatly decrease <b>brain</b> <b>metabolism</b> of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. [...] PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of seizure focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several radiotracers (i.e. radioligands) have been developed for PET that are ligands for specific neuroreceptor subtypes such as [...] raclopride, [...] fallypride and [...] desmethoxyfallypride [...] for dopamine D2/D3 receptors, [...] McN 5652 and [...] DASB for serotonin transporters, [...] Mefway for serotonin 5HT1A receptors, [...] Nifene for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-FDOPA for the AADC enzyme).

40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of tongue and body acupuncture with clinical function and <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism</b> in children with a severe type of cerebral palsy. Four children were recruited. The motor function belonged to grade 5 of the Gross Motor Function Measure (ie, completely nonambulatory). Daily tongue and body acupuncture was applied for 5 {{days a week for}} 8 weeks. The Functional Independence Scale for Children (WeeFIM), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), and positron emission tomography of the brain with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were performed at baseline and after acupuncture. None of the children had any significant change in the Functional Independence Scale for Children score, despite the fact that all mothers scored 3 on the Clinical Global Impression Scale (ie, 25 % improvement) in overall function. The <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism,</b> however, showed a > 10 % increase in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices and cerebellum. Thus, a short course of tongue and body acupuncture was shown to increase <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism,</b> despite lacking any clinical functional improvement seen within the 8 -week course, possibly owing to the severity of the motor dysfunction and the short duration of treatment. The objective increase in <b>brain</b> glucose <b>metabolism</b> might serve as a surrogate marker for assessing the subclinical efficacy of an alternative treatment before any objective clinical improvement is evident. A larger-scale study for different degrees of severity of cerebral palsy and an impairment model should be undertaken to correlate clinical with neurometabolic change. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
