5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are <b>both</b> <b>good,</b> but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 1905, American author Molly Elliot Seawell sailed for Europe on Kroonland on a {{day when}} six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, {{departed}} New York. In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted <b>both</b> <b>good</b> and bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E

5|$|Seemingly gone forever, another Scarlet member {{known as}} Xi-Tiger {{took control of}} the organization. Under his rule, Scarlet became too brutal even for themselves, and they called for Epsilon to reclaim his position. More or less {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} group, Xi sought to find and assassinate Epsilon himself. He planned an attack on an A-Human research laboratory, where children with special abilities had been kidnapped and experimented on. Upon arriving, Xi-Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys. However, he was unsure because he couldn't pinpoint the evil from Epsilon, who had entered the boy's body and was now living as a parasite. Xi-Tiger took a young girl hostage and threatened to kill her unless Epsilon revealed himself. The boy flew into a rage and morphed his body into Epsilon himself. Xi seemed to sense this strange power, and in fear, killed the girl and fled. Epsilon had completely split his dual personality apart; with <b>both</b> <b>good</b> and evil Epsilons now chasing after Xi-Tiger.|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the optimal pricing strategy of duopoly retailers who sell two goods to three consumer segments: two segments that {{are interested in}} one good, and one that wants to buy <b>both</b> <b>goods.</b> The analysis suggests that the markup {{on one of the}} goods might be negative and that the existence of consumers who buy <b>both</b> <b>goods</b> can either increase or decrease markups. Surprisingly, the addition of the consumers who buy <b>both</b> <b>goods</b> (unchanging the number of the other consumers) might decrease profits, and increasing the number of consumers who buy one good might also reduce profits. This suggests that firms should consider carefully how additional customers might affect the competitive environment and the equilibrium before attempting to attract them to the market.

25|$|Symbolism {{plays an}} {{enduring}} {{role in the}} telling of a story through painting or other Chinese art.

Some examples of symbols include bats which means <b>both</b> <b>good</b> wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month.
