5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar {{later than the}} Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related tongue, usually called Telerin. It was seen by some Elves to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of Túna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E
5|$|Whiteside became United's {{youngest}} {{first team}} player since Duncan Edwards in 1953, {{when he made}} his debut as a substitute against Brighton & Hove Albion in a 1–0 league win at the Goldstone Ground on 24 April 1982, two weeks before his 17th birthday. He later played in the FA Youth Cup final defeat to Watford, though it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> year before he appeared in the final of the senior competition. He turned professional at Old Trafford on his 17th birthday, signing a three-year contract, and he shared a room with Steve Coppell, who was heading into retirement due to a knee injury of his own. He also struck up a close friendship with Paul McGrath, who would also face similar problems with his knee. On {{the final day of the}} season, eight days after his 17th birthday, he became the club's youngest goalscorer in a 2–0 home win over Stoke City.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Gruenwald {{succumbed to}} a heart attack, {{the result of}} an unsuspected {{congenital}} heart defect. Gruenwald was a well-known practical joker, and due to his young age, many of his friends and co-workers initially believed the reports of his death to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> joke. Just days prior, he had done one of his trademark cartwheels down the halls of the Bullpen. A longtime lover of comics, Gruenwald made it known amongst his friends and families that his one desire was to have his ashes used in part of a comic. In accordance with his request, he was cremated, and his ashes were mixed with the ink used to print the first printing of the trade paperback compilation of Squadron Supreme.|$|E
25|$|RENACE {{failed to}} attract {{considerable}} {{support among the}} Carlists. Its political base was reduced mostly to Catalonia, with adherence declared by some Traditionalist groupings from other regions, like Navarre, Vascongadas and Andalusia. No nationally recognized Carlist leader joined Sivatte, though some like Joaquín Baleztena voiced their support. In the early 1960s it became evident that RENACE instead of a dynamic renovating force turned out to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> Carlist splinter faction, though its doctrinal purity and intransigence versus Francoism {{made it a point}} of reference within the Traditionalist realm. While initially Sivatte might have envisioned the initiative as a political grouping, its limited appeal rendered those ambitions irrelevant; as a result, RENACE formatted itself in-between a symbol, a pressure group and a doctrinal think-tank. Its public activity consisted of publishing the Tiempos Criticos periodical, issuing various manifestos and especially of organising public rallies, usually styled as Catholic feasts and with systematically decreasing attendance. The group did not assume a formal structure, apart from forming its Junta Suprema. Historians differ as to how Juntas de Defensa del Carlismo, local initiatives emergent across Spain in 1962–63, were related to RENACE.|$|E

500|$|Despite this {{positive}} reaction from readers, for decades literary critics dismissed the style found in Uncle Tom's Cabin and other sentimental novels because these books {{were written by}} women and so prominently featured [...] "women's sloppy emotions." [...] One literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery, [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> sentimental novel," [...] while another described the book as [...] "primarily a derivative piece of hack work."

[...] Rudolf Simek agrees that Hlín seems to appear as another name for Frigg in Völuspá, and that in skaldic poetry Hlín was a well-known mythological figure by the 10th century. Simek states that Hlín is likely simply another name for Frigg, and that Snorri [...] "misunderstood {{her to be a}} goddess in her own right in his reading of the Völuspá stanza." ...|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Suns David Zurawik was {{critical}} of the show's characterization and comedy, but {{was impressed by the}} staging of [...] "Don't Stop Believin', calling it [...] "so elevating and inspirational that it almost redeems all the stereotypes and lame humor that come before. Grit my teeth as I did at how one-dimensionally empty-headed the writing could be, I will still be back for the start of this series in the fall because of its musical punch." [...] Tom Jicha for The Sun Sentinel similarly claimed of the episode that: [...] "A lively score and appealing performers somewhat compensate for overly familiar characters and plotting", while Rob Owen for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette agreed: [...] "It's the music that makes Glee a gleeful delight.

The Guardian contributor Alexis Petridis gave the song a negative review, {{and said that}} although most of tracks of the album are [...] "genuinely exciting [...] there's certainly some unremarkable stuff on offer, notably 'Seal It With a Kiss' and 'I Wanna Go." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also noted that [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] {{is the point of}} the album in which [...] "things stop being fun and start becoming intensely repetitious", criticizing specifically [...] " [...] utterly stupid set of syllables repeated ad nauseam for no reason whatsoever? [...] the 'ably' part of 'uncontrollably' gets recycled far beyond the point where it just sounds stupid."

500|$|Following Khrushchev's {{controversial}} {{claim that}} (pure) communism {{could be reached}} [...] "within 20 years", the new Soviet leadership responded by fostering the concept of developed socialism. Brezhnev declared {{the onset of the}} era developed socialism in 1971 at the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. [...] Developed socialism was described as socialism [...] "attaining developed conditions", the result of [...] "perfecting" [...] the socialist society which had been created. In short, it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> stage in the development of communism. Developed socialism evolved into the Brezhnev regime's ideological cornerstone, and helped it to explain the situation of the Soviet Union. However, the theory of developed socialism theory also held that the Soviet Union had reached a state in development where it was crisis-free, and this proved to be incorrect. As a result, Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's successor, initiated the de-Brezhnevisation of the Soviet Union during his short time in office, and introduced more realistic ideological theses. He did retain developed socialism {{as a part of the}} state ideology, however.|$|E

Jeff Cork of Game Informer considered the game [...] "proof that games don’t {{need to be}} excessively complex {{in order to be}} fun", complimenting the [...] "top-notch" [...] writing. Chris Watters of GameSpot commented that the structure of each episode can become repetitive, and that commonly the Jack Attack round would decide the winner of the game, negating the previous questions, but still considered the [...] "large amount of legitimately clever and surprisingly funny writing" [...] a key aspect of making You Don't Know Jack as [...] "one of the most entertaining trivia games on the market". Gamepro's Nathan Grayson was more critical of the game's lack of features, considering the number of questions [...] "painfully short" [...] compared to the Buzz! trivia game series, the [...] "absolute bare-bones basics" [...] presentation, and the game's somewhat juvenile sense of humor. Though the Toronto Suns Steve Tilley generally praised the game's humor, he noted the lack of variety of gameplay modes, and that playing with people online may be spoiled by those that had already run through all the game's episodes.|$|E

500|$|U2 Live at Red Rocks {{is often}} cited as a {{watershed}} moment in U2's history which established their reputation as an exceptional live act. In the liner notes of the remastered version of the film, music journalist Anthony DeCurtis wrote, [...] "this concert set goals for U2 that might have daunted any other young band. But {{in the shadow of}} their wild ambitions at Red Rocks, these four boys met, once again, the men of their future, and became who they would become." [...] Rolling Stone called the band's performance of [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] from the film one of the [...] "50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll". The magazine said, [...] "he sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and—shown in heavy rotation on MTV—broke the band nationwide." [...] Director Gavin Taylor said that the video [...] "kick-started their career" [...] and [...] "fired them like a rocket into the sky". In 2009, Relix named U2's performance at Red Rocks the 24th-best concert of all time. The Denver Post said the concert affirmed Red Rocks Amphitheatre's status as a premier outdoor venue. Rocky Mountain News said that the concert was [...] "asily one of the most famous, acclaimed concerts of the 1980s (if not all time)", and that people who have visited the Amphitheatre ever since have been disappointed to learn that the pyres {{are not part of the}} venue and were only used for the U2 concert. Music biographer Dave Thompson said the concert [...] "transformed U2...into a very successful rock band", and that without U2, [...] "Red Rocks would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> smartly lit amphitheater".|$|E
