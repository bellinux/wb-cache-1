When the mine experiences sudden overpressure an air bladder inflates caused by the differential in pressure between the upper and lower sections, this prevents the activation of the mine. When constant pressure is applied the pressure equalizes gradually and the mine is activated, a firing pin is flipped sideways by the plunger into a stab-detonator, which fires the horseshoe-shaped main explosive charge.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted {{to obtain the}} heat transfer and pressure drop data for an integral trailing edge cavity test section that simulates a novel turbine bladeâ€™s internal cooling passage with <b>bleed</b> <b>holes.</b> Local heat transfer is measured on both the suction and pressure sides by a transient liquid crystal technique, while pressures at six positions are recorded by pressure calibrators. Moreover, flow characteristic {{and its effect on}} heat transfer are analyzed for conditions with or without bleed flow. The experimental results show that, in the cases with bleed flow, local heat transfer on the pressure side exceeds that on the suction side in the first and second channels. In the cases without bleed flow, in the first and third channels, local heat transfer on the suction side weakens whilst it increases significantly on the pressure side. For the second channel, non-bleed condition leads to a more balanced heat transfer distribution between the upstream and downstream channel. Besides, after the <b>bleed</b> <b>holes</b> are blocked, heat transfer in the first bend region on the suction side declines sharply, while the opposite phenomenon occurs for the second bend region on the pressure side. In both bleed and non-bleed cases, the total pressure of six measurement positions decreases continuously along the channel at the same Reynolds number and it promotes for higher Reynolds number. Among all the measurement points, under the same flow rate condition, the highest speed occurs at Position 5, which also shows the maximum difference between the total and static pressures. When the <b>bleed</b> <b>holes</b> are blocked, the total pressure at each measurement position appears to increase...|$|R

The tighter the spring, the more boost that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the boost pressure to reach the wastegate actuator. There is a <b>bleed</b> <b>hole</b> on the boost controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air that would be trapped between the wastegate actuator and the ball after it is seated again.

40|$|Boundary-layer bleed is an {{invaluable}} tool for controlling the airflow in supersonic aircraft engine inlets. Incoming air is decelerated to subsonic speeds prior to entering the compressor via {{a series of}} oblique shocks. The low momentum flow in the boundary layer interacts with these shocks, growing in thickness and, under some conditions, leading to flow separation. To remedy this, <b>bleed</b> <b>holes</b> are strategically located to remove mass from the boundary layer, reducing its thickness and helping to maintain uniform flow to the compressor. The bleed requirements for any inlet design are unique and must be validated by extensive wind tunnel testing to optimize performance and efficiency.

Both Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and hybrid large-eddy / Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (LES/RANS) turbulence closures are used with the IB technique. The approach is validated by conducting simulations of Mach 2. 5 flow over a perforated plate containing 18 individual <b>bleed</b> <b>holes.</b> Predictions of discharge coefficient {{as a function of}} bleed plenum pressure are compared with experimental data. Simulations of an impinging oblique shock / boundary layer interaction at Mach 2. 45 with and without active bleed control are also performed. The 68 -hole bleed plate is rendered as an immersed object in the computational domain. Wall pressure predictions show that, in general, the LES/RANS technique under-estimates the upstream extent of axial separation that occurs in the absence of bleed. Good agreement with Pitot-pressure surveys throughout the interaction region is obtained, however. Active suction completely removes the separation region and induces local disturbances in the wall pressure distributions that are associated with the expansion of the boundary layer fluid into the bleed port and its subsequent re-compression. Predicted Pitot-pressure distributions are in good agreement with experiment for the case with bleed. Swirl strength probability-density distributions are used to estimate the evolution of turbulence length-scales throughout the interaction, and the effects of bleed on the amplification of Reynolds stresses are highlighted.
