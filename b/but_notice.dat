5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> that their past looks more strange than they remembered it: The family continually pauses for cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E
25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. <b>But</b> <b>notice</b> that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

500|$|As Vermeer {{secretly}} {{works on}} the eponymous painting, Catharina cannot help <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> something is amiss and her growing jealousy of Griet becomes apparent. As Griet deals with her growing fascination with Vermeer and his talent, she has to fend off Van Ruijven's attempt to rape her. Later, when Catharina {{is out for the}} day, her mother hands Griet [...] her daughter's pearl earrings, and asks Vermeer [...] to finish the painting. [...] At the final painting session Vermeer pierces Griet's left earlobe so she can wear one of the earrings for the portrait. [...] Griet then runs to Pieter to be consoled. [...] They caress and make love in a barn, where Pieter proposes marriage, but unexpectedly leaves, whereas she then returns the earrings to Catharina's mother.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: I know people who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for my taste, too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details." [...] Dana Stevens writing for Slate Magazine said: [...] "What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didn't cry onceI, who just the day before wept through the entirety of my child's thoroughly upbeat school play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richthofen {{took the}} {{flamboyant}} step of having his Albatros painted red {{when he became}} a squadron commander. His autobiography states, [...] "For whatever reasons, one fine day I came upon the idea of having my crate painted glaring red. The result was that absolutely everyone could not help <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> my red bird. In fact, my opponents also seemed to be not entirely unaware [...] ". Thereafter he usually flew in red-painted aircraft, although not all of them were entirely red, nor was the [...] "red" [...] necessarily the brilliant scarlet beloved of model- and replica-builders.|$|E

That requirement cannot {{be reduced to a}} first-order sentence, as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows. That theorem implies that there is some countably infinite subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call internal numbers, and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call [...] "internal sets", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{square of}} any {{positive}} or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a real square root. [...] However, {{it is possible to}} work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the complex numbers, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number. [...] This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by i (sometimes j, especially in the context of electricity where [...] "i" [...] traditionally represents electric current) and called the imaginary unit, which is defined such that [...] Using this notation, we can think of i as the square root of −1, <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> that we also have [...] and so −i is also a square root of −1. By convention, the principal square root of −1 is i, or more generally, if x is any nonnegative number, then the principal square root of −x is ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{answer is}} that {{nonlinearity}} enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. [...] <b>But</b> <b>notice</b> that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking [...] [...] So if [...] is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. [...] This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out {{the same way that}} heat can be carried off [...] "to infinity" [...] in an infinite flat plate. [...] But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to homogenize the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero. [...] In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not {{to turn it into a}} flat Euclidean geometry.|$|E
