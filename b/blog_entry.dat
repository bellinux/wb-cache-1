A February 2009 Compete.com <b>blog</b> <b>entry</b> ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6million unique monthly visitors and 55million monthly visits. In March 2009, a Nielsen.com blog ranked Twitter as the fastest-growing website in the Member Communities category for February 2009. Twitter had annual growth of 1,382 percent, increasing from 475,000 unique visitors in February 2008 to 7 million in February 2009. Twitter's annual growth rate decreased from 7.8 percent in 2015 to 3.4 percent in 2017.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} method for {{collecting}} Hiroshima Electric Railway (Hiroden) <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> in a <b>blog</b> database. Hiroden <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> are defined as travel journals that provide regional information at Hiroden streetcar stations. The task of collecting Hiroden <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> {{is divided into two}} steps: (1) collection of <b>blog</b> <b>entries,</b> and (2) identification of Hiroden <b>blog</b> <b>entries.</b> To investigate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted some experiments. From the experimental results, we obtained precision of 82. 4 %, recall of 64. 5 %, and F-measure of 72. 4 % in automatic identification of Hiroden <b>blog</b> <b>entries.</b> Finally, we have constructed a system for providing travel information along Hiroden streetcar lines.

40|$|Automatically Linking News {{articles}} to <b>Blog</b> <b>entries</b> People often write in their blogs about news articles or events in news articles. In this case, however, {{the details of}} the news articles or events are often poorly described in such <b>blog</b> <b>entries.</b> Therefore, the readers of blogs need to find the original articles, which contain more details of the news articles, when they want to know about them. In this paper, we propose a method for linking news {{articles to}} <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> that refer to them. Since <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> and news articles are considered to be rather different, the common model for linking is not applicable. Therefore, we similarly used a vector space model for finding similar documents, but we tried to devise a new weighting method and a distance metric to improve the performance, by taking into account the properties of <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> and news articles document sets...|$|R

25|$|In a <b>blog</b> <b>entry</b> dated August 9, 2010, Utada {{announced}} the greatest hits album, {{as well as}} a planned hiatus. Utada does not consider the hiatus her retiring from music, as she enjoys the process of making music, and considers herself a musician. Furthermore, Utada still has a contract to fulfill with EMI Group, a contract signed in 2010 to release music globally under her name Hikaru Utada. Utada explained in an interview on Tokio Hot 100 that the hiatus was to ground her, as since she was 15 she had not grown up, and had no concept of 'true personal growth'. During her hiatus, she intends to do overseas volunteer work, learn French and re-establish relationships with her relatives, such as with her father and manager Teruzane Utada, who she admitted not even meeting outside of work.|$|E

40|$|Among a {{huge number}} of blogs on the internet, only some of them are {{considered}} to have great contents and worth to be explored. We call such kind of blogs cool blogs and attempt to identify them. To solve the cool blog iden-tification problem, we consider three assumptions on cool blogs: (1) cool blogs tend to have definite topics, (2) cool blogs tend to have sufficient amount of <b>blog</b> <b>entries,</b> and (3) cool blogs tend to have certain levels of topic consistency among their <b>blog</b> <b>entries.</b> Corresponding to these assump-tions, we extract a mixture of topic probabilities using a topic model, exploit the number of <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> of each <b>blog,</b> and calculate the topic consistency among <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> us-ing distance functions over topic probabilities, respectively. We show the benefits of the proposed assumptions through these features. A feature unification model is also presented to achieve highest effectiveness. The experimental results on Japanese blog data show that we can improve the clas-sification results by applying proposed assumptions. 1...|$|R

One day, we'll all look back on this day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye." [...] Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink. Mitchell wrote, [...] "Did he just get the last laugh on South Park? Conspiracy!" [...] In response to the media coverage, West wrote another <b>blog</b> <b>entry</b> on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny, but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his [...] "ego epiphany".

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the use of}} blogs {{has been}} a {{remarkable}} means to publish user interests. In order to find suitable information resources from {{a large amount of}} <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> which are published every day, we need an information filtering technique to automatically transcribe user interests to a user profile in detail. In this paper, we first classify user <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> into service domain ontologies and extract interest ontologies that express a user’s interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a top-down approach. Next, with a bottom-up approach, users modify their interest ontologies to update their interests in more detail. Furthermore, we propose a similarity measurement between ontologies considering the interest weight assigned to each class and instance. Then, we detect innovative <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> that include concepts that the user has not thought about in the past based on the analysis of approximated ontologies of a user’s interests. We present experimental results that demonstrate the performance of our proposed methods using a large-scale <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> and music domain ontologies. ...|$|R

This paper describes a computational solution to the interpretation of human-readable blog publishing policy documents into semi-automatic disconformance checking of corporate <b>blog</b> <b>entries.</b> The disconformance interpretation is regarded as an abductive reasoning, which is operationalized by information flow computations. Using a socio-cognitively motivated representation of shared knowledge, and applying an appropriate information flow inference mechanism from a normative perspective, a mechanism to automatically detect potentially non-conforming <b>blog</b> <b>entries</b> is detailed.
