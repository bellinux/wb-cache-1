5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths). Possibly because their saliva and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer have {{so far not been}} proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{external}} morphology of Lepidoptera is {{the physiological}} {{structure of the}} bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. <b>Butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{sub-type of}} coastal batik called Jawa Hokokai is not {{attributed}} to a particular region. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages. The workshops funded by the Japanese however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called Jawa Hokokai. Common motifs of Hokokai includes Japanese cherry blossoms, <b>butterflies,</b> <b>and</b> chrysanthemums.|$|E
5|$|Bees are {{themselves}} Müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths (Lepidoptera) which {{are themselves}} distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|Bordering Prospect Park is Devil's Dip, {{a former}} gravel and clay pit. The site is {{recognised}} by Reading Borough Council {{as an area}} of wildlife and historical interest, and examples of elm, walnut, ash, horse chestnut and sycamore trees grow there. Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as lesser celandine, bluebells and Queen Anne's lace appearing in the spring. Peacock <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.|$|E

She was ranked number 1 in 200 m butterfly, sixth in 100 m <b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> seventh in 200 m medley; she made {{sporting}} history by {{becoming the first}} Irishwoman to win a European title in 200 m <b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> the individual 400 m medley in the same year.|$|R

5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species {{for the purpose of}} mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{have special}} {{importance}} {{in the evolution of}} the insects. Two of the most important insect orders, Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.|$|E
5|$|The book's list of {{contents}} reveals Thayer's {{heavy reliance on}} bird examples, filling 16 of the 27 chapters. Other vertebrates occupy 5 chapters. Insects receive 3 chapters, of which two are dedicated to lepidoptera - one to caterpillars, one to adult <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths; the remaining one devotes 14 pages to all other insects, starting with orthoptera including the leaf-mimic grasshoppers.|$|E

5|$|The gorge was cut mostly {{into the}} Clifton Down Limestone, {{part of the}} Lower Carboniferous Pembroke Group], by water. The site was {{occupied}} by humans in the Neolithic Era and their tools and flint arrow heads have been discovered, along with pottery from the Bronze Age. There are also fossils of small mammals from the Late Devensian. The nature reserve provides a habitat {{for a variety of}} flora and fauna, including flowers, <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> bats.|$|E
5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
5|$|The {{red maple}} is a {{used as a}} food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of red maple as {{an important source of}} winter food. Several Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths) utilize the leaves as food; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.|$|E

5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Frank Pick {{was born}} on 23 November 1878 at Spalding, Lincolnshire. He was the first child of five born to draper Francis Pick and his wife Fanny Pick (née Clarke). Pick's {{paternal}} grandfather, Charles Pick, was a farmer in Spalding who died in his forties, leaving eight children. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Clarke, was a blacksmith and Wesleyan lay preacher. As a child, Pick was bookish, preferring to read and build collections of moths and <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> objects found on the beach rather than take part in sports.|$|E
